Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""
Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights
It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag
Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Just don't come in my face and ask me why
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba makin 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Yo man
Yo man, what's up?
What's your worst nightmare?
Is this it?
( *steps are heard *)
- Yo hus, I like the 8Ball jacket
- Yeah yo, it's dope, give it up, sucker
- Nah man... nah man
( *brawl ensues
shots are fired

heartbeat sounds stop

Hey, hey yeah)
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger	(3X)
(Funkyeeee... yeah)
I said peace to a brother and then I shot him
I pulled away, I know that I got him
Then I rolled up the cheeba-cheeba
That's all a brother like me really needed
Why I did it, or really why I done it?
I don't know why, but the game, I run it
Thinkin way back how the story was told
Gettin (funkeeee) when I was 12 years old
I didn't give a damn about tyin no thether
All I needed was the nine millimeter
All my homies has been some thugs
To make a little money we sold a little drugs
PSK, just makin that big green
A rough brother at the age of 16
But nowadays I'm a dope rap singer
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger
(Funkyeeee... yeah)
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger	(4X)
A shoe-shine nigga I never will be
When you gonna ever let a brother be free?
What up with that (funkeeee) that I see
When I turn on my TV?
Cause if you think a young brother really care
About a brother livin in Bel Air
Hell no, I'm straight from the ghetto
Smoke a little weed just to stay a little mellow
A Asiatic blackman, you understand
Because I'm rich you think that I'm a dopeman
I hear your laughter everytime that I say that
But you won't laugh when I pull on the git-gat
You rather see me pickin yo cotton
Than a young blackman clickin and clockin
G's, cause I'm a dope rap singer
Your worst nightmare a young gangbanger
(Funkyeeee... yeah)
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger	(4X)

Listen up, hard teachin go down from the wild side
School didn't do it, so what, gotta try
Crime - in this game yourself that's all you got
If you're soft, hard, the most times end up smooth shot
So now you're deep, you're down
Clear the line one time to trip and slip
And when you slip you're slidin right to a grave
You shoulda learned at school cause the drugs made you a slave
(Yeah) sucker

Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
[Man, let them know what time it is.]
Microphone living is a thing of the past
and all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass.
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn,
you fucked it all up when you let Michael in.
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock.
Because rock and roll is all illusion,
comes to no basic conclusion.
Rap like jazz is not all fusion,
DJ, 1200's you know he's using.
I don't.
I don't.
Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours,
five two point size in my court of force.
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight,
sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright.
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike,
till I get on the mic, make everything right.
Girl in my face, boy giving me static,
sat by my side, 38 automatic.
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat,
hang downtown on a market street.
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard,
so all you long haired freaks better be on guard.
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out,
because that is what rap's all about.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver,
took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever.
Got real high as you will know,
thinking to myself while I rocked her so.
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap,
so I told her: ""Fly freak, sit upon my lap"".
But I went too fast, gave me a slap,
but I looked into her face, gave her this rap.
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
you can call me MC, you can call me on the phone.
Came into the party, checked out my face,
but you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face.
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on,
right microphones, all night long.
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge,
no other MC's got this kind of song.
I don't.
I don't.
Def been mighty, rap all nighty,
chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy.
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi,
we mean you ladi will have to party.
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller.
I get bad, watch her and bone her.
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her.
You left your girl, but you know I stole her.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""

How many times must a brother in America
That I figure, have to pull on the trigger
To prove to the world that he is a man
That's one thing I can never understand
Cause you'se a fluke and a coward and a faggot
You know suckers like you are on the wagon
Schoolly-School, and I'm standin on top
Make it known that I'll never, never, never be stopped
There ain't a brother in the place any tougher
There ain't a sucker in the house any rougher
So tell me why that you wanna be a prankster?
There's only one Original Gangster
(So hot, so hot, so hot, so hot...)

Schoolly-School, and I'm on it like a doctor
That is how that you know that I locked ya
And if you can't understand the reality
Of a young blackman mentality
Cheeba, cheeba, and your hand'll keep tokin
Like a Uzi you know that I'm smokin
I keep ya dancin, to the rhythm
That's what Schoolly-School likes to give them

I'm the brother that you know that is slappin em
And then you tell all those suckers you a gangsta
Well, I'd say you ain't nothin but a prankster
And if you think that you gonna keep foolin em
I'm the brother that you know that is schoolin em
And then you gonna get killed by the Uzi
I think of all the times that you are a dewsey

Say wassup to my lil' sis
13 and already knocked up
But the little black daddy don't give a fuck
Her mama mad cause she gave up
Took her to church every week, it couldn't save her
I got a daughter and a son
Before he say 'daddy', little nigga might say 'gun'
I sit back, I blow a kiss to my mother
Even though she old, the nigga still love her
But I never knew my daddy
Nah, all I knew was some nigga in a Caddy
Stopped by every year by Christmas
Talkin that bullshit he missed us
I don't look like my granny or my mammy
I look like a muthafucka named Sammy
My mother musta been a young slut
Always talkin about the days when she had a big fat butt
You gotta do what you gotta do what you gotta do

Nikes on my feet, Jimmy hat on my dick
Sis on the corner, tryin to sling rock
Gramps in the back, tryin to get cock
Got me a forty, balls kinda itchin
Mom in the kitchen, start the bitchin
Smokin cheeba, take another hit
Step into the bathroom and take a little shit
I start thinkin and thinkin and thinkin
My man, I wish that I was drinkin
With my niggas, all of my homies
Fuckin with the bitches, they wanna blow me

I fucks your aunt, your sister and your mother
Now to the nigga in the Caddy who said he was my daddy

Don't care if the people in a hell of a rage
You can find our name in the Yellow Page
Schoolly-D, Code Money, man, you know we're gettin paid
Don't talk that shit about after the show
Cause after the show we pimp the hoe
Take the fly freak back to our room
Like Ralph Cramden said, with a big bang-zoom
We gettin paid
(Hit me)
You know gettin paid one thing I like
Pimp Pretty on my left, Code Money my right
Don't got my dough, we don't have to fight
But I tell you one thing, I won't touch the mic
I tell you now, sucker, gettin right to the point
Don't got my dough, we fuckin up the joint
Dictionary describes gettin paid from work
So get my money straight, cause I ain't no jerk
We gettin paid
(Hit me)
Here's one thing I won't do in the 80s
Is get paid off little old ladies
On the street corner, man, snatchin a bag
And ain't sellin no booty cause I ain't no fag
You work a 9 to 5, man, tryin to get paid
While I'm home with your wife, you know I'm gettin laid
Sorry man, I didn't know
All I do is pimp a hoe after my show
We got paid

Turn up the bass to make a funky sound
Like a nuclear bomb hitting the ground
Grab a fat chain, put around my neck
Hell of a man and I'm gettin respect
When I step on stage make the girls say 'Oww'
Turn up my microphone and I'm showin you how
All the money makers in the place I'll make 'em say 'Ho'

Here-here, here we go again
Here we go again

I'm not a shoe shine nigger, I'm proud to be black
Proud to be on this microphone hittin this rap
Proud to be chillin hard with my boys on the ave
Proud to do what I do and to have what I have
Proud to be Schoolly-School and you all know my name
Proud to make lots of money but I'm not insane
Cause people don't dig it when you start actin fame
Not a toy, not a boy, and ain't playin no games
So here we go, here we go again
So here we go, so here we go again
Here we go, so here we go again

Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
[Man, let them know what time it is.]
Microphone living is a thing of the past
and all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass.
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn,
you fucked it all up when you let Michael in.
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock.
Because rock and roll is all illusion,
comes to no basic conclusion.
Rap like jazz is not all fusion,
DJ, 1200's you know he's using.
I don't.
I don't.
Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours,
five two point size in my court of force.
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight,
sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright.
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike,
till I get on the mic, make everything right.
Girl in my face, boy giving me static,
sat by my side, 38 automatic.
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat,
hang downtown on a market street.
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard,
so all you long haired freaks better be on guard.
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out,
because that is what rap's all about.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver,
took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever.
Got real high as you will know,
thinking to myself while I rocked her so.
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap,
so I told her: ""Fly freak, sit upon my lap"".
But I went too fast, gave me a slap,
but I looked into her face, gave her this rap.
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
you can call me MC, you can call me on the phone.
Came into the party, checked out my face,
but you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face.
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on,
right microphones, all night long.
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge,
no other MC's got this kind of song.
I don't.
I don't.
Def been mighty, rap all nighty,
chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy.
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi,
we mean you ladi will have to party.
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller.
I get bad, watch her and bone her.
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her.
You left your girl, but you know I stole her.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""

Holdin his dick, fuckin with the young whores
You say, ""Yo nigga, what's your name?""
He say, ""Suck my dick, tell your mother do the same""
His mother and his father said fuck him
All the bitches on the block will suck him

Hold up, nigga, what the fuck was you thinkin?
Who's the nigga that you think that you're gankin
In my eyes you can see all the anger
That's why I'm a fuckin gangbanger
What the fuck did you expect me to wanna be?
When everytime that I turn on my TV
And every bit the drug dealer look like me
It's alright for me to pull the trigger
Just as long as I pull it on another nigger
Fuck it, I keep you dancin like James Brown
Alright boy, if you want it, here's the breakdown
I don't care how rough you think you is
I beat you down in the muthafuckin midst
I ain't tryin TO be your sister or your brother
I kick your ass like if I was your mother
I'm gonna make their minds so muthafuckin simple
To the rhyme Schoolly is a nympho
Or like a crazy muthafucka on cocaine
I'm the nigga that's fuckin up yo brain
To the niggas that's talkin that bullshit
The only thing that you're gankin is my dick
There'll never be another muthafucka like me
There ain't another brother ever will excite me
Inside my black Lee's a muthafuckin weapon
You don't dig it, keep on steppin

You don't dig what I'm sayin, then fuck you
Cause sellin drugs only job that a nigga got
Sellin caine to the kids in the parkin lot
Some niggas live, some niggas gotta get dropped
You say 'damn' - my man, you don't understand
How could you be so cold to a brotherman?
Don't come around here teachin and preachin
Because a nigga like me you ain't reachin
Cause all I care about is sellin my lleyo
Makin money like a nigga make mayo
Toke on weed, sippin on my Olde E
All the crackheads all on my wee-wee
Rollin hard in a rag-top Volvo
911 on my ass, I'ma roll on
You don't understand where a brother comin from
That's why young black men always on the run
You either gangbang, or you get hanged
Kill another nigga, it ain't no thang
(Gangster Boogie)
Pull a 8 on a nigga, say 'fuck you'
Then pull away in my BMW
Cause on the street you gotta be a little meaner
But that's how my pockets get greener
Runnin shit, gotta be a little candid
Some time you be a little a bandit
Sellin dope out of my crackhouse
You either kick game, or you get gamed
(You don't know the pain)

Yo muthafucka, it's time to get rolled on
Strolled on, you better get a hold on
How the fuck you expect me to get back
If I never had to pull on my git-gat?
Because to me it ain't nothin but a killin
That's how a nigga be feelin
I call a homie on the mobile ( *dialing* )
What up, my nigga, it's about that time
Grab the Uzi, the eight and the nine
When a nigga be rollin on the ave
Sometime it gonna be a blood bath
But when I'm comin, no playin, no jokin
I let the Uzi and nine be smokin
Alright now, back to my tale, yo
Spot the nigga on the corner sellin lleyo
Pull up, ""Yo, what up, gee?""
He didn't see my nigga in the backseat
All I heard was ""Please don't shoot!""
( *shots* ) grabbed the caine and the loot
(It's like that, and that's the way it is)
(So damn) (tough)
Now a nigga on the top of the world, see
I got the women, the dope and the jewelry
I'm livin large in a fat-ass crib
Don't give a damn about the shit I just did
Then I heard a knock-knock at my door
Said ""Oh shit!"" - I hit the floor
One of my homies on the ave was a big snitch
I said ""Oh shit!"" - jumped through the window
Bullets were flyin, people was cryin
Fuck it, some nigga was dyin
You either gas on or you get gased
Now I die with a bullet in my ass

And if the shit ain't hot, you know that it's it
And then I meet a fly lady, you're lookin real slick
And then I take you in the back, I give you a kiss
And then I kiss you in the places that I just won't miss

[ VERSE 1: Schoolly D ]
Run sucker, run sucker, run sucker, run
Sucker run, I'm comin like a shotgun
Schoolly-School, I'm never gonna be the one
And if you think that I'm ever gonna let up
Shut up - and just get up
I'm on your back, got you runnin like a rabbit
I'm in your veins like a cocaine habit
And let you know that I'm never gonna stop
Until a sucker get dropped
I'm not your boy, you ain't my master
Another brother gotta do what he has ta
Do, and everything that I wanna
The only job I got standin on the corner
And everything that I do is illegal
Another brother, but the brother was an eagle
Run, run, run, run, run, you better run fast
Another sucker just got gased
[ VERSE 2: Scholly D ]
Alright sucker, you want the real deal?
Here it is, at the tip of the cold steel
Shoot a punk and a shoe-shine nigger
Shoot em all what Schoolly D figure
Line em up, put your finger on the trigger
Sit back and take a little swigger
And let a rhyme intoxicate your mind
Like a cheeba and a forty of wine
I'm gettin tired of every other brother in the ghetto
Gotta sell a little lleyo
Because a brother didn't have enough knowledge
Didn't know because he didn't go to college
I'm gettin tired of the suckers on my back
Because I'm black, hard with a dope rap
Do you think a young brother wanna hear that?
They rather hear a brother pullin on a git-gat
Run, run, run, run, run, you better run fast
Another sucker just got gased
[ VERSE 3: guest rapper ]
Jump fast out the startin block
>From this gat from the fact that I hold you will feel the pop
Gunshots on the neighborhood
Are the sounds of brothers hard up to no good
Feel the pain of a bullet wound
For suckers tryin to slip and trip, time to meet their doom
Like the sounds of a battle cry
Either run, soft sucker, or get caught, do or die
Flee, it's the reality
Cause I see another weak comp, it's so violent, see
Brothers dyin over property
Dope, money, women and ki's
So now the time is at hand
You can sit down, be a punk or be a man
It's like chillin, cold lampin on death row
And I catch you, boy, in a grave you go
Stay out on the move, it ain't for fun
Yo School, make them suckers wanna run, run, run

Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""
Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights
It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag
Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Just don't come in my face and ask me why
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba makin 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba

Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need

Way, way down, in the ghetto Tee
The badass pimp stepped on the signifying rapper's feet
And the rapper said, Nigga can't you see
You're standin on my motherfucking feet?
The badass pimp said, Sure I ain't heard a cocksucking word you said
You say some more, I'll be standin on your motherfucking head
Yeah that's what he said
Cause every day, when the sun go down
The badass pimp come and kick that rappers ass all over ghetto town
But the rapper got wise, started using his wit
And said man, I'm gettin tired of this kick-ass shit
So early, early early the very next day
The rapper said, mister pimp, mister pimp I got something to say
There's this mean, big bad faggot comin your way
He talk about you so bad, turn my hair gray
Listen, listen to what he say
Listen to this mister badass pimp
This what the faggot said
He said, you know your daddy and he's a faggot
And your mother's a whore
He said he seen you sellin asshole door to door
Yeah that's what he said, listen to what else he said mister badass pimp
He said, your granny, she's a dyke
And your other brother, he's a faggot
And your little sister Loo
She's so low she sucked the dick of a little maggot
Yeah that's what he said
The badass pimp was mad
Jumped up in a hell of a rage
Hopped in his Caddy and loaded his 12 guage
Caught up with the faggot on 55th and Vine
Said you faggot, it's gonna be your ass or mine
The faggot looked at the pimp, and saw fear in his eyes
Said motherfucker, you better go fuck with somebody your own damn size
The pimp made his move, and thought he was fast
The faggot side-stepped him and kicked him in his ass
They fought all that night, and all the next day
That faggot kicked that pimp's ass in a hell of a way
Me myself I don't know how he survived
Came back to the projects more dead than alive
And the rapper, standin up on one of those tall ass project buildings
He said, DAMN somethin smells
He said, mister badass pimp look live you've been through hell
As I told one of my hoes before you left
I should've kicked your ass my motherfucking self

I used to flow
They used to call me a rhyme animal
Some of them don't call me rio mo so
I try a new style refuse to get wild
On the B side because I still got my pride
The pride comes from another time
My father and mother plus God
Blessed the rhyme
Born in 1960 seventy suckers quizzing
Me what was it like before everybody
Tried to be like Mike
Back in the day when our peeps had to fight for our rights
To make the day fell aaight
But there is no is without a was
No about to be buts or because..I got the
Pride
Reminiscent of another time
Dashikis, bells, to straight legs
Platforms & picks
See it wasn't just about the fro
It was what was underneath that fro
Black power for the powerless
Deuce and quarters, caddies 442's
Yeah pride
[Verse 2]
Say, say it loud
James singin black and I'm proud
I was in third grad when Dr. King got slain
And if I had to read a book about
The facts, the fact is that the black
Would be overlooked look
1967 I was seven livin proof of
what I had learned in my youth
what a difference a score and a
decade makes mistakes and super bad
breaks wait
I ate the food in the lunch programs
And now I see the young strung out on
Grams so I work on a go on
And so on and soon communicate to
Get the young straight
Cause I got the pride

Who we are we got to know
Who we was and once we know

The panther party before lad-i-da-di
Put pride inside plus taught karate
Fed heads in many ways many days
Were served locked down protectin the

If they don't communicate then the
You can't get it
Problems have to be solved they
Won't go away so man what
You say and don't sway
Gotta get that pride

{What nigga...now get the fuck outta here...fuck what you think
Chuck D ain't shit
YouknowhatI'msayin....cheep motherfucka....bitch ass nigga
How the fuck this gon say Chuck D the hardest rapper...)
Yeah...uhum.
Let's set it off
Mista (Yo P..yo Slick)
Line 'em to you
Yo Bob
They call me mista..
Aaight
To you
This about report to the comissioner
To you
This about that time
Set it off..
[VERSE I]
To all the critics that had me counted out
To all the cynics I fought & Thought they had me figured out
Who opened doors on 32 tours
From last year's GIVE IT UP goin' back to YOU
'RE GONNA GET YOURS
38 countries in the name of hip hop
Never stopped, 7 Continents
Attackin governments
Political rhyme practice
I gave cause you lack this
Serious sense of time and world geographics
Bring ya brain outside philly
East to the West, North to the South
If you're black we can't all be Big Willie (never)
And to be judged by a hit
By some counterfeit click
That's some bell curve shit
Cause I'm cool like this
Now how I get my swerve on I keep hittin nerve bombs
Relax the saluting arms carry on and carry on
My record speaks for itself I never stopped the hip hop
And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself
[Chorus]
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah..I'm tellin you)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (I'm tellin you)
If you don't know me you can call me
(c'mon)
[Verse II]
Can't win without beginning it
Heed the word of the brother and the voice that got muscles in it
Now Im'ma show you a waste is a terrible thing to mind
Rhymes without education equals butter from the gutter
And all this talk about the street we stay in & playin
Is a fishtank by the hated you thank
And you say ho hum another story to bore me
Maria take a letter tell Mayor have a freeknik in Marietta
Here comes the halfstepper hypocrites and advocates
Who care
But be crashin like US Air
The last Bohemian but you'll never see me intoxicated
By bones in drug zones I hate it
One on one black CNN
Keep it from bein in the cartoon network
The rhymes can hurt and do work
Got you lookin for the loot
Is down down to the one & shoot
50 fought to the cracker so for all y'all I getz blacker
[Chorus]
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
Public Enemy number one
You don't know me you can call me Mistachuck
If you don't know me you can call me mister
[Verse III]
I don't care for Range Rovers
Cause the price is too high
And I feel em gettin over
Land Cruisers, Issuzus or new shoes
Man dem notes is heavy
That's why I got a couple Chevies
Low budget I am believe me when I speak it
Limousine ain't a damn thing unless they let me keep it
I duck the cakewalk and all dat BS talk
About what's fatter West coast, North, South or New York
It don't matter
It don't matter
[Chorus]
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah..)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
You don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one
If you don't know me you can call me mister chuck
(The hard rhymer)
(Yeah check it out
Mister
For you
Yes...and you...and you....for all y'all)

No buddah bliss
She musta missed it
Still bangin wit the anger
Kissed a soul sanger
Class of 78 sunset strip
Cause I been outta high 20 years with 30 somethinish peers
What a trip
Never drank beer with the boyz
But the love we shared was for the art of noise
Dump puff a smoke make me cough
But I'm not a chimney
So you can't call that shit soft
What turned me off
Swore their breath stunk
Plus/I never got out rhymed by a drunk
Now a style is your hair or something you wear
Who said it's getting zooted
Till your brains polluted
I ain't playin
This mainstain stayin rooted
Instead of be'in pimped & then prostituted
Won't be the last time
Cause it ain't the first
So do I dare disturb the universe?
[Chorus]
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
--Goin' down, diggy diggy down-- ---Method Man
[Verse 2]
No U turn
I pumped up, hittin switchez
But all this talk reflect niggas & bitchez
Where did that come from
Only the labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
I hit em up the rhyme uppercut
Tell me what have they done for me lately but hate me
Attack me might as well be damn Pataki
This hip hops in me
So they can't stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
Wreckin all elements destroyin all irrelevant
It all comes down to this
What good is talking bout the hood
When you got mutherfucken madness
Am I ringin those senses
Brothers drinkin worse shit
Then they're be pourin in their benzes
I give a damn so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe
[Chorus]
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
--Goin' down, diggy diggy down-- ---Method Man
[Verse 3]
See I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind
Brain trained on the devil level
You don't measure a man by what he got
It's what he does, what he left & what he takin care of
A brother like me annoys em
But I'm +Kool G+
When I +Rap+ about em it's +Poison+
Everybody wanna be Big Willie
Chasin down loot Dole & Newt
Who do you shoot ?
I'm fingerin targets
While ya figurin
Figgaro Figgaro
Soup opera for the niggaro
I ain't chasin no movies like Jason
Or Loolapalooza cause I ain't no looser
Ruff stuff to the babies spread like ravens
To the heads of heads but I ain't crazy
Chorus to the chorus verse to verse
But do I dare to disturb the universe?
[Chorus]
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity

When I was a lad
We had indentured bond servants
Stout conishman and Scotsman
{Indeed sir endeed
And if one of them runs away you couldn't tell 'em from any other Englishman
But take our black slave sir
and no matter how far they run they always black}
[Chorus]
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you
[Verse 1]
Quiet as it's kept
Some of y'all slept on yourself
Next time you hit the mirror black
Turn you back on yourself
I wouldn't trust some a y'all
If you was my right hand, man
I'd cut it off at the wrist
Like you name was Benedict
Enough lead
To threaten 50 niggas dead, you said
Cause niggas is back to perms & relaxers
All up in their head
TV niggas only make you laugh, embarrass
Can you catch it
Nigga fever new season
Of modern day Stephen Fetchits 1990's
Niggas be fraid of the noise I made
Bout their master crackers giving out
Disasters in the hood
Phony honeys be gone when they moneys be gone
Niggaresses artificial chests'
Posin fake hair & high dresses
[Chorus] x2
Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you
[Verse 2]
Madd niggas hittin shit
But they health be quittin it
Clothes and car makin the men
Havin counterfeitin fit
Seizing niggas be praisin
Benzes Beemers when they got em
Shined and simonized foreclosed
Bit they grills be rotten
Simon sez niggas jump
And they jump for these Hilfiggers
Tommy hates niggas high priced styles
White as wild rice
Niggas be dwellin in hell and the
Negros pray for heaven
Fuck the preacher he don't reach
You my nigga roll a seven
Niggas forgettin trips about those
Slavery ships
Niggas wasn't there they claim
Fuck that nigga bring the pain
Niggas be dealin Narcotic
But don't get the money nigga
Women or the fame my nigga
Or the mother fuckin game

Now you wanna kill me
That may be true 1,2
But can you kill the nigga in you
Now you wanna kill me
Cause my lyrics be true
But can you kill the nigga in you

Brother Isac drop it on the groove one time
Let the beats check-check out your mind

Yo-yo brothers I say to you
Become literate, study your history
Then you know where you need to go
Don't get socialy anestezied, thinkin you got the rock
When you got the pable
Learn who you are
Come together and survive
It's time to learn to love again
It's time to stand out and be near
Think about your history
And free it from your misery
Learn...to love again

It's time to learn to love again

[Chuck D]
Aight, this is how we gon' do it, come on, uh
Birth, she here on the planet Earth
Against the curse of grain and submitted brain
Trained to submit the corporate reign
Radiation range, generation pain, fear
Migraines created by megabytes
Immune the night, every flight, it ain't right (it ain't right)
Uh, to the vast alone, the world shook up the ozone
In a world within a world (shake it down now)
The universe with new universes within
A world within a world saving the world from danger
In the realm of darkness, saved by Dark Angel
[MC Lyte]
Who am I, an angel sent from above
Showing no love to thugs that rub me the wrong way
Nothing but cold nights and long days
When the woman ain't got nothing on me
Put a thin smile, criminal, post up cause it's about to get lonely
Queen of the underworld, you let it be ?
You come here, you better be ready to stoppin' our fear
Long after you're put to rest I'll still be here
Fightin' for those in despair, Dark Angel
[Chuck D]
Can't stop it, catastrophic prophet
Bankrupt to the prophets, erupted volcanic rockets
Fibre optics use backers, reform the hackers
Reserve, real world slacker, she burn baby burns
So we can learn, crazy learnin'
Access codes, blasts to overloads
Seen the old ways explode, saved by Dark Angel
[Chuck D]
The science, robot alliance
Comes in all shapes, with fairly new apes takes for granted
God planet, dangling rage, got a train against the grain
Throwing mama's pain off the train, talking heads
[MC Lyte]
Talking heads, walking dead, some living to die
Some fighting the power, some living a lie
Keeping the truth from the vocal booth
Hoping you cool, big brother scoping you
Ready to get hi-tech and dissect your brain
Then your chest and open you
Knowing a few will only make the grade
Dark Angel, from who you should be afraid

Here it is, want ya nigga for, eh is it not?

Sometimes snappin bitches turns into slappin (STRESS!)
In the club, see there ain't no love lost

Some only in it for the money
Fuckin two-headed dog on the prowl, hear the GROWL-OWL!
In the world turned upside down
A paralytical, now stick around with a frown
What is a beef? Beats the hell out of me
Flippin thangs to swang, neither here or neither there, yo
It's what they hear as a man, the murder music
Interpretation, invented the script, who isn't Nations (This, is, Ab,
normal)
A back lash hit the black fast
The straw monsters will pursue to find out what a nigga wrote
But pull my people for a track
Look forward to the black reparations for us to get the money back
Cracked in the back, don't give me no stress
Gonna make you accountable, your crime is surmountable
A full chick without chicken, just sucker you can stick it
where the sun don't shine to kiss the back o' mine
Don't give me no stress, hahahahaha

Yo Chuck it's time for rip down, block lyrics get chopped vicious
My flow position like their waistline shiftin
Ain't nuttin different, y'all pit fall, the dungeon
Witness the drama comin focus splungin, finishin, where's the lungs?
Send a swifter hurricane, frozen dope vein wicked
Minds get lifted like the cross nails is broke off
Ya flippin once it's slow court, the street talks, we eat back
with poison on the track, can't avoid that, rhythm we bring noise at
(Bring the noise) This chapter son is Melquan's scripture
Vision adrift, the mind kid is blinded, but rhymes be on a science climate

My brain fluid vodka, lyrics influence the proper membrane
My first begin blended with strength vain to strike earth
My mic work wonder, soul with thunder
The Son Slaughter mission will finish script

not just some whacko from Waco
crazy ill plead insanity
just to save humanity
be good like no johnny
never like no Guliani
cause they never could stop me
not their imaginary Rocky
get me then acquit me attack me
what a shock to Pataki
here here watch a brother
duck the chair
I fear only the one
upstairs who got no
I'm not part of the click
it's whatcha see is Whatcha get
my realities personal
many times rhymes forget
some ain't heavy like others
but they still lie my brothers
disgusted at the
other folk laughin at us
wit the ashes to the ashes
the bluntz to the bluntz
a chip off the ol block I shock
and get the word in
maybe that's why a brother like me
shoulders the burden
I smells between the white sheets
a hell of a beast
in the black lurkin
don't front step to the circle
spending more time in the air than
a flight attendant
the rhyme got winded on the way up
on what I thought was a lay up
these two cent criticizers don't
realize we all under a microscope
of a nation of other folk
so all this nigga callin is we fallin
attitude have we forgotten
entertaining is todays way of pickin cotton
so that the younger bees and gees
think all we can bees is a big dreamer
in order to get a Benze or a beemer
some stuck in that 96
Lexus per minute shit
it's that same 'ol story that bores me
ignores me
my metaphors be over
that head of even heads
to some I'm prophetic
to the rest I'm pathetic
led a movement of mentals
against the fesd and point spread
on beats madd noize and
funky instrumentals
there once was a time
we fought the power with a rhyme
now the attitude goin round
no use tryin
got more hits than Pete Rose
had for the Reds
now they be on anything Deion
intercepts
except I'm in a zone now gettin wreck
I get around
can I get down like Craig Mack
how can I get down
back like sock 'em robots who
forget it was him
who parlayed
the styles of KRS & Rakim
and brought it to a different level
against the so called devil
who had the nerve to throw a bell curve
and test me, arrest me
lemme go let it grow no
I've been thru the afro
it's been a long time so my childhoods
retro
unlike today
as we be watchin us pay
the price that bugs me know'n that God
don't like ugly
got a free pair of lugz
to run quicker from the slugz
but slipped from the madd dirt
that was swept under the rug
a lil' down, but not out
not what you thought it was
peace no beefs, I getz love

See I'm hangin in like Sam Sever
To all you Johnny come latelys
Who didn't recognize how great and
Clever some of those rhymes be
Think quick
Been flowin over domes
Mad vocab to silly crabs

You don't stop
I need my noize like Patrick & Barkley need rings
Like Griffey gets swings
1st time rhymes played me off like Sacramento Kings
3-6 for the 9-6 1 move my rhymers with the times
Wit no crimes or pantomime
No great pretender spenders
20 years got mad tears leavin tears in they beers
From the rear old school getting theirs
You getting scared
It is on & on and 3 steps ahead
Hot topics shock in the house
Fulla heads
Getting burned while you learn on a hospital bed
Madd kids never checkin for what I said
Jack be quick

I'm stay'n simple
But the sound remains insane
Same mad pain no gain getting getto on the table

Resurrection of the one man vocal section
Spirit in your dark ass direction
For your mind body and soul protection
Reality checks keep it real
Bring in real checks
On & off the road been through
1100 sondchecks
Those influenced under the influence
Getting mad hits from truants
Dazed & confused hangin wit crews
Who livin blues
A million doomed consumers
Who say they know they black
Threw they medallions back
In exchange for 40 dozen six packs
Born under a terrible sign in 1969 comin
Blind
Livin inside hard ass times
Getting kicks offa wack karate flicks
He kills but gots no fightin skillz
It's getting ill so many funerals
Stylin now its gold plated medallions
I didn't know under fros
We got so many black Italians

[VERSE I]
To all the critics that had me counted out
To all the cynics I fought & Thought they had me figured out
Who opened doors on 32 tours
From last year's GIVE IT UP goin' back to YOU
'RE GONNA GET YOURS
38 countries in the name of hip hop
Never stopped, 7 Continents
Attackin governments
Political rhyme practice
I gave cause you lack this
Serious sense of time and world geographics
Bring ya brain outside philly
East to the West, North to the South
If you're black we can't all be Big Willie (never)
And to be judged by a hit
By some counterfeit click
That's some bell curve shit
Cause I'm cool like this
Now how I get my swerve on I keep hittin nerve bombs
Relax the saluting arms carry on and carry on
My record speaks for itself I never stopped the hip hop
And I never jumped backwards or kissed myself

If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)
Public Enemy number one (yeah..I'm tellin you)
If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck (D)

[Verse II]
Can't win without beginning it
Heed the word of the brother and the voice that got muscles in it
Now Im'ma show you a waste is a terrible thing to mind
Rhymes without education equals butter from the gutter
And all this talk about the street we stay in & playin
Is a fishtank by the hated you thank
And you say ho hum another story to bore me
Maria take a letter tell Mayor have a freeknik in Marietta
Here comes the halfstepper hypocrites and advocates
Who care
But be crashin like US Air
The last Bohemian but you'll never see me intoxicated
By bones in drug zones I hate it
One on one black CNN
Keep it from bein in the cartoon network
The rhymes can hurt and do work
Got you lookin for the loot
Is down down to the one & shoot
50 fought to the cracker so for all y'all I getz blacker

If you don't know me you can call me Mistachuck

If you don't know me you can call me mister
[Verse III]
I don't care for Range Rovers
Cause the price is too high
And I feel em gettin over
Land Cruisers, Issuzus or new shoes
Man dem notes is heavy
That's why I got a couple Chevies
Low budget I am believe me when I speak it
Limousine ain't a damn thing unless they let me keep it
I duck the cakewalk and all dat BS talk
About what's fatter West coast, North, South or New York
It don't matter

No buddah bliss
She musta missed it
Still bangin wit the anger
Kissed a soul sanger
Class of 78 sunset strip
Cause I been outta high 20 years with 30 somethinish peers
What a trip
Never drank beer with the boyz
But the love we shared was for the art of noise
Dump puff a smoke make me cough
But I'm not a chimney
So you can't call that shit soft
What turned me off
Swore their breath stunk
Plus/I never got out rhymed by a drunk
Now a style is your hair or something you wear
Who said it's getting zooted
Till your brains polluted
I ain't playin
This mainstain stayin rooted
Instead of be'in pimped & then prostituted
Won't be the last time
Cause it ain't the first
So do I dare disturb the universe?

Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
--Goin' down, diggy diggy down-- ---Method Man
[Verse 2]
No U turn
I pumped up, hittin switchez
But all this talk reflect niggas & bitchez
Where did that come from
Only the labels can explain
But they play dumb while they take from
I hit em up the rhyme uppercut
Tell me what have they done for me lately but hate me
Attack me might as well be damn Pataki
This hip hops in me
So they can't stop me
The rhyme animal has resurfaced
Wreckin all elements destroyin all irrelevant
It all comes down to this
What good is talking bout the hood
When you got mutherfucken madness
Am I ringin those senses
Brothers drinkin worse shit
Then they're be pourin in their benzes
I give a damn so I curse
So do I dare disturb the universe

Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
Gettin you down like gravity
--Goin' down, diggy diggy down-- ---Method Man
[Verse 3]
See I always been a rebel
Now I got my own kind blind
Brain trained on the devil level
You don't measure a man by what he got
It's what he does, what he left & what he takin care of
A brother like me annoys em
But I'm +Kool G+
When I +Rap+ about em it's +Poison+
Everybody wanna be Big Willie
Chasin down loot Dole & Newt
Who do you shoot ?
I'm fingerin targets
While ya figurin
Figgaro Figgaro
Soup opera for the niggaro
I ain't chasin no movies like Jason
Or Loolapalooza cause I ain't no looser
Ruff stuff to the babies spread like ravens
To the heads of heads but I ain't crazy
Chorus to the chorus verse to verse
But do I dare to disturb the universe?

See my rhymes be hot like soul food spots
I don't give a damn Jenny Jones
A 100 million homes
Grown folks doin anything
To be some known folks
Go tell Montell he gotta sue to
Get like Donahue
Between soap operas and bras
Commercials sop opraahh
Gossip by their own admissions
Failed smoke emissions
So enquired minds wanna know
How low can we go
On a TV show Hoochie and the Blow
Reverses the race
Cursed the nation the doom generation
The next voice you hear
Says get the fuck up outta here
From pyramids, to hearin what he, she or they did
Ain't no bizness on the screen
If you know what I mean
--Lazyness is in the house
Slob with no jobs is in the house--
He say she say they all got beef
Dragin their business all over in the street
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talkshow created the fool
[Verse 2-Abnormal]
They tryin to portray themselves like
Their movie stars, big Willie style
Francin a mansion and fancy cars
But in real life they live in projects
And trailer parks all the bullshit they talk
Makes me wanna spark L's
Looking at channel zero from hell
They frontin like they saying something
But they ain't sayin nothin
Players & hustlers, hookers and druggy's and racist
I'm tryin to face this
The poison that they feed in this my mind
I'd rather be watchin BET Rap City
On my big screen TV believe me
When I say it
They do it for the greed of the fame
Following the trends of the Hollywood game
It a shame
Sellin their souls for 50 beans
Looking like fools on the tube
Just to get the damn cream
Dragin their business all over in the street
[Verse 3-C.Brewser]
Talk show host really TV evangelist
Bringin the most scandalous folks
With lies they can't handle it
Mad Drama trauma coming at you out to harm ya
Infect your mental with an infectious type of insomnia
Lies in disguise about women who really guys
And guys who really women like that's such a big surprise
You lies it's just like this whole world enterprize
Best understand black man is infinite potential wise
Realize TV amazing confusion type illusion
Brought to your brain cell
Giving you mental type dillusions
It's all brain wall syndrome
Sending you in a cyclone
Plus had for your health so best leave it alone
Bad things is some of them think its cool
Talkshow created the fool

I be crawlin in that head like a virus
You say lemme try this
Way back when medicine
Scaring some of our children

Is back in black in you kitchen
Tell granma to chill on those chitlins
Make no mistake Ricki Lakes eatin mad steaks
Off your bad breaks

And another state of mind
[Verse 1]
I used to flow
They used to call me a rhyme animal
Some of them don't call me rio mo so
I try a new style refuse to get wild
On the B side because I still got my pride
The pride comes from another time
My father and mother plus God
Blessed the rhyme
Born in 1960 seventy suckers quizzing
Me what was it like before everybody
Tried to be like Mike
Back in the day when our peeps had to fight for our rights
To make the day fell aaight
But there is no is without a was
No about to be buts or because..I got the
Pride
Reminiscent of another time
Dashikis, bells, to straight legs
Platforms & picks
See it wasn't just about the fro
It was what was underneath that fro
Black power for the powerless
Deuce and quarters, caddies 442's
Yeah pride
[Verse 2]
Say, say it loud
James singin black and I'm proud
I was in third grad when Dr. King got slain
And if I had to read a book about
The facts, the fact is that the black
Would be overlooked look
1967 I was seven livin proof of
what I had learned in my youth
what a difference a score and a
decade makes mistakes and super bad
breaks wait
I ate the food in the lunch programs
And now I see the young strung out on
Grams so I work on a go on
And so on and soon communicate to
Get the young straight
Cause I got the pride
[Break]
Flamboyant names
Free Huey, Eldridge, Bobby, Angela
Woodstock to Kent State
Music of the time for the mind
45's, Aretha, Four Tops
Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes
Assassinations Presidents
Sixties Soul
Now in order for us to know
Who we are we got to know
Who we was and once we know
Who we was then we know who
Were gonna be
Pride
[Verse 3]
The panther party before lad-i-da-di
Put pride inside plus taught karate
Fed heads in many ways many days
Were served locked down protectin the
Black and the brown
Now today the old must spread it
I said it
If they don't communicate then the
You can't get it
Problems have to be solved they
Won't go away so man what
You say and don't sway
Gotta get that pride
[Outro]
King, Malcolm, Medgar, Hampton
Ritos and rebellions
Newark, Watts, Uptown
Harlem that is black gold
Ghetto stell
I reserve the right to be nothing
But a man
We reserve the right to be nothing
But men and women

I see what's comin
Madd brothers will be bumming
After the math the drug lords brought the wrath
Of those of us who once thought we needed to be weeded
Bust, dust made that head bust
I remember came after
Cheba cheba had you wide like a receiver
What looks like fire is ice
Fall for the flame
Catch it twice like Jerry Rice
Nice !!
Against odds I recognize it in the cards
Hard to be played back and black the jack of all spades
Ash to ashes blunts to blunts
Some of these geez ain't real
I seen em once upon a time
So many rhymers and not enuff rhymes
I hope they around next year but I fear
I'm all time and I'm down for the ruffness
But what good is the rhyme without substance

Now back to the underdog

The rhyme never thanks
Who be givin
Ravin who on top of the charts
Grabbin the Gavin
Now I can't use my name
Half the body be dancing head swoll
But one thing I can do is finger roll
The hit list grows like Pete Rose
As I rise above who you recognize
I wanna know that disguise
Who are you?
And wher'd you come from ?
I don't know where you come from now see how you run
First on a verse I gets vertical
Flip works like a grammatical gigolo
A head from many years ago
I brought the noise on the R&B boys
The chronological
Or the ghetto celeb
Never claimed the best
Nor was I great at finesse
But everything is everything
And everything is real
It appears I shift gears
To the ears of my peers
No appeal
I'd rather be the underdog

The picture I'm paintin
Is just intelligence
Not another nitwit you can get with
Self haters, traitors
Thinking now that later
Turned they head
Dissin something that I said
I get ill on a beat track
Make me wanna go back
Way back
Where it's not a trace of Babyface
Unplugged tempos from this undrugged temple catalog
I rather be the underdog

YaknowhatI'msayin? Word up son
Listen up son, knowhatI'msayin?
(Watch out for them man) Listen up son, check it out though, yo
Open your eyes get wise and look alive focus your attention
Windows 95 updated high tech lynchin
Crosses of the colored man who claims he holds the keys to the safe
Secrets of the world, blow him in his face
Who's the master of the universe, galaxy and planets
Babylonians ecstatic moon the sinkin of Atlantis
(Be the one soul original black filled with melanin
Goin out like represent Kuwait in two thousand)
[Ice-T]
Brothers gonna have to put themself in check
Three strikes you in the penzo, checked to your neck
Your woman cries, your baby grows up alone
Talkin through a three inch glass on a two way phone
You tell me brothers got no options today
You best to listen to the Ice closely fool, crime don't pay
Gas and dope bullets and coke ain't the way
You need to march with the Nation on Atonement Day, represent
[Chuck D]
Now, to all my brothers we be rhymin like this
Yeah I can handle, but they can't kill it mill or dismantle it
And we can leave the component alone
Show all my brothers a brother instead of negro
Crackers in the back obscene knahmean
But I've been knockin em out the box like ??
So on the single we be flowin at the lingo
Comin together, not solo like Mandingo
[Chorus: all together]
So where you at y'all?
Right here, hangin with my brothers and we showin no fear
So where you at y'all?
Right here, if you represent then throw your hands in the air
[Smooth B]
Arm Leg Leg Arm Head
My people with braids waves dreads and baldheads
A million strong doin duty, wisdom strength beauty
Ummah Ahs they are, sun moon star
And it's a holy day, come sober
Smooth B in D.C., sixteenth of October
In unity there is power, none can devour
Hour after hour, we shower
[RZA & Killah Priest]
Imagine us travellin back to Nazareth
Most fabulous
To raise up the black dead slaves like Lazarus
When I catch rays through the blaze holy essays
No more death days and vexed slaves possessed in caves
Yo it's the last days and times we gots to raise your mind
Brothers walk around dumb different and blind
Pregnant Earths always carry eggs
I pledge to never fall off the ledge
and blacks remain family like Sister Sledge
[Shorty]
God prepared the table for us, in the presence of our enemy
Now we soon to be, one in unity
One two three I'm a G
But the God inside is that G I chose to be
The world is a stage and everybody plays a part
I'm not considered, the one with a sensitive heart
When I say black man you say go
Black man GO black man GO
Chorus
[DA Smart]
Somebody stole me, you took me from Kunta to Toby
and mold me, in a way that you freed me but still hold me
What you tryin to pull? Eatin us like cannibals
Whatever happened to that forty acres and that animal
Now you tryin to use integration just to fool us
Like Malcolm said, we been hoodwinked and bamboozled
Mama cryin, and I ain't lyin
I'm going to Washington for justice, I'ma get it, or die tryin
Don't hesitate, he's at the gate
And that's a million black men in one place to set it straight
So black women applaud the black God
I'm DA Smart, with the million man march
[KAM]
Damn that's how you know the world about to end
Rain hail snow earthquakes and a million black men
Upon the God indivisible
With liberty and justice for all cause y'all done made us miserable
With this AmeriKKKan nightmare
That's why October 16th we gon be right there like yeah
The same niggaz that you want gone
Well we about a million deep on your front lawn
It's goin on from here to Abraham Lincoln's statue
And every brother here thinkin yeah we need to holla at you
About this overdue bidness
With the Black Muslim, Christian Jew and Jehovah Witness
To get this out in the open the only way
Is for us to declare a black holy day
The homies say that they rollin
Plus we got family, forty miles up, controllin
[Chorus x4: to fade]

Hah hah, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hand, you still can't get no cards
You couldn't deal with scoob if we was playin cards
But if I got beef and it's time for code red
My drill is like a hoe, and be takin mad niggaz to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join a army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from?  england, you somebody great?
You burnin scoob, ""i don't think so mate""
I got the style that gets you open like a bag of smoke
I have your friends ""ah-hah man, that shit ain't dope""
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
And play like e.t. and phone your black ass ho-wome
Yo sauce, if you're down with the groo-hoove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove
Verse two: sauce
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
N-b-a style, fann-tastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight I write left-handed
Cuz I like, to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm bookin whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take eddie
If I was fred, I think I'd have to bone betty
Suckin and luckin, hey, niggaz I'm duckin, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So shyheim, if your down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove
Verse three: shyheim
Yo, yo
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killin
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from u.s.a. to asia to russia
If your shit stinks i'ma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from cali son
My jams be packed like a farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the f in effin foul
The rugged child locks you down like rikers isle
And got more girls than a trailerload with shabba
More super than cat, I'm the punani don dada
So big daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove
Verse four: big daddy kane
Now tell me whoooo is the mannnn?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And steppin to me, thinkin I can be touched?  huh
Not even michael jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What did I just show ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the mexican
The messiah that's feared great, leavin rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none!	huh
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me,
But with with speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better g
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistable, non-competible
No-no-i'm-not-sayin-i'm-the-best, I'm just sayin I'm fuckin incredible!
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So jay-z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove
Verse five: jay-z
Uh, one checkin it two, checkin it three
Check out the j, check out the a, check out the y, check out the z
Hey g!
I'm breaking mc's up like epmd
And these nuts if you rappers tryin ta see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it runnin a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggaz can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the g from brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eatin me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
Till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you lovin the way it's, goin down baby
So ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove
Verse six: ol dirty bastard
Come on
Wu-tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""well God damn what's the recipe? ""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is g
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of ason, who carries on like a manager
Yo!, sounds fly right? danger!!!

"51","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/big_daddy_kane/raw_remix-lyrics-32336.html","big_daddy_kane","Raw (Remix) ","lt;Here it comes... gt;
lt;Documentary sample:
Since the far-off days when man first heard a scratchy noise
On a cylindrical drum accompanied by staccato human tones,
It has been his aim to add breadth and depth, to give realism,
And spaciousness, and, even where it applies, to convey actual movement gt;
Intro:  I start to go, my rhymes'll flow
So, get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around it's time to get up
Pardon my expression, but I'mma tear shit up
I appear right here, and scare and dare, a mere musketeer
That would dare to compare, I do declare
Getting busy is where it's at
But what you're saying, you wouldn't get a point for that
Cause you're a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light
But I drop bass just like Barry White
So how could you think that you pose a threat
You say you're rocking, how many shows you get
All your vocals go local on the M-I-C
Mines go a great distance, like AT amp;T
I'm now new to this, I'm true to this, nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So, yo, go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse
Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct, I get respect, I'm out to collect
Cash money, cause I get raw
lt;Break gt;
Everybody get up!  (x4)
Kane:  boy do I hate a...
I'm coming!  (x5)
Here I am, R-A-W
A terrorist, here to bring trouble to
Phony MC's, I move on and seize
I just conquer and stomp another rapper with ease
Cause I'm at my apex and others are below
Nothing but a milliliter, I'm a kilo
Second to none, making MC's run
So don't try to step to me, cause I ain't the one
I relieve rappers just like Tylenol
And they know it, so I don't see why you all
Try to front, perpetrating a stunt
When you know that I'll smoke you up like a blunt
I'm genuine like Gucci, raw like sushi
To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the A.M.
I'll make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a
Little rhyme with authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowd's majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues
I'm sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw
lt;Break gt;
Everybody get up!  (x5)
With speech like a reverend, rappers start severing
And in my lifetime, believe I've never been
Beaten, or eaten and just tooken out
You know, come to think about it, I keep MC's looking out
And real nervous when I'm at your service
Give me that title, boy, you don't deserve this
I work like a slave to become a master
And when I say a rhyme, you that it has to
Be perfectly fitted, cause I'm committed
The entertainer and trainer and Kane'll get with it
I go and flow and grow to let you know
I damage ya I'm not an amateur but a pro-
-fessional unquestionable without doubt superb
So full of action, my name should be a verb
My voice will float on every note
When I clear my throat, that's all she wrote!
The minute that the Kane starts to go on
Believe it's gonna be smooth sailing so on
As I put other rappers out of their misery
Get them in a battle and make them all history
Ruling and schooling MC's that I'm dueling
Watch them all take a fall as I sit back cooling
On my throne, with a bronze microphone
Hmm, God bless the child that can't hold his own
Cause I get raw
lt;Break gt;
Ain't it good to you  (x3)
Documentary:  here's an experiment to begin with...
Twenty-four sev chilling, killing like a villain
The meaning of raw is Ready And Willing
To do whatever is clever, take a loss, never
And the rhymes I bust, coming off is a must
And I come off hard with rhymes that are odd
I rip the microphone and leave it scarred
Never smoking or hitting or taking a sniff
Only crushing MC's that be trying to riff
I get strong and titanic, do work like a mechanic
Make MC's panic, they all get frantic
And skeptic, like a girl on a contraceptive
As I rock but hey, what you expected
I'll get raw for you just like a warrior
Rapping like a samurai and I'll be damned if I
Ever let a Fisher-Price MC hang
Their rhymes are toy, nothing but yin-yang
So if we battle on the microphone
Bring your own casket and tombstone
And I'ma preach your funeral
Tell me who in the world could ever come with more
I get raw

I' with this
I' just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
Cause it? ?8
Time to set it straight, knowwhatI'saying
And ain? no half stepping
Word
I' ready>
Rappers stepping to me they want to get some
But I' the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can? get with me
So pick a BC date cause you'e history
I' the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it? gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that? the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pitbull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I' different, so don? compare me to another
Cause they can? hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you'e petty
You'e just a butter knife, I' a machete
That? made by Ginzu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here? your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause...
<Break>
Ain? no half-steppin?<scratched> I' the Big Daddy Kane
(3 times)
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'l have to open
A school of MCing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have MC? coming out sounding so similar
It? quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I' much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don? mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it? the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over MC?
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'l still have strength
And no, that? not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'l only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can? awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can? do me none
So, think about it if you'e trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know that...
<Break>
Ain? no half-steppin?<scratched> I' the Big Daddy Kane
(3 times)
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can? see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I' losing?
Psst, picture that...
<Break>
Ain? no half-steppin?(3 times)
Mister Cee, step to me...
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I' the author
I grab the mic and make MC? evaporate
The party people say, damn...that rapper? great
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain? easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like letter, man
Now that? dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC?, who are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I' finished, I' sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'ma show you who? with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I' homicidal
That means murder, cause I' about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'l just break him and bake him and rake him
and take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign...
Assalam Walaikum!

Okay, okay, okay, okay
Attention to the whole crew
Scoob Lover, Scrap Lover, I don't need your dancin
Mister Cee I don't need you on the turntables
Ant Live I don't need you collectin the dough
And Little Daddy since you my brother
get yo' ass on in here
Cause we gettin ready to take things down the line
Here we go one time
Prepare yourself for MC terror
And don't make the error of tryin to come near a
rapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab
to grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like
Vincent Price, but you never been so nice
So back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice
Kickin ass in every committee, city to city
Until both shoes are city
The regulator innovator dominator creator of data
Plus an imitator assassinator
Lyrics don't display a too don sweet
Hard as concrete, and always on beat
Steppin to this, you're not allowed
You keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd
Snatchin the microphone real proud
But your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud
So next up down the line, Scrap Lover
[Scrap Lover]
Aiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine
But I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when
a toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and
there's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after
is smashed, for that reason you have to
make sure each and every lyric is harmless
Cause if not, you won't be able to calm this
Brother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove
And prepared for the unexpected, to make a move
So put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop
And if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop
The capital S the C, the R-A-P
stands for me, cause I'm the
only MC with an original rap style
You disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile
So stay off the set, with George and Jet-son
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Co-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit
or get ate like oats and barley
Save your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie
So next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover
[Scoob Lover]
Yo, the microphone's mine
It's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all
Well god damn it's me y'all
Jump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly
Sip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high
I might wave hi..
.. at a pretty young girl that walk by
But yo, you all that, you can't stop?
A-with the weave in your head like a mop?
You must know karate, cause your face look chopped
Now back to the subject of the matter
I eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter
Let me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed
And when I'm low-key I throw on a brim
But I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin
What are you, smokin?
You be hopin wishin and prayin
to be like Scoob but what are you sayin?
Well it takes style, charisma, class
Fuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass
So next up, movin down the line
Mister Cee
[Mister Cee]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Mission, to make DJ's feel the wrath
So here's a paragraph, written on behalf
of the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador
Makin a massacre, you couldn't last through a
round of combat, where my left arm's at
My mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack
I shake and bake or fake a snake
Take em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake
When I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt
I'ma tear shit up
So next up goin down the line
The Little Daddy Shane
[Little Daddy Shane]
The mic is all mine
MC's crawl by when they see this tall guy
Six foot three huh, nobody's small fry
The Little D-A double-D Y
The S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains
I'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke
One false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!
So take it easy and slide on greasy
Cause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep that in mind, mon cherie amore
Cause I'm a lover you find quite young
And Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from
So keep it on and you don't quit
That supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit
So next up down the line, Ant Live
[Ant Live]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Yeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back
And it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack
Got the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got razors in the place
Not Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface
But I know, if some shit goes down
I'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown
My face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
All I need is my loaded four-five
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene park and survive..
And my name is Ant Live
[Big Daddy Kane]
Now that's what I'm talkin bout
That's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs
And we outta here, love peace and hairgrease

Anytime you're ready, check it
I got seven mack 11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten mack tens, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had mc hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie smalls; the millionare, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Little gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin
When I throw my clip in the ak, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the d-e-c-k
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to matteo
Now we smoke weed like tony montana sniffed the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad l's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my god, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
[tupac]	motherfuckin biggie smalls!
[kane]	what you gonna do with it tupac?
[tupac]
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfuckin middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this
I thank the lord for my many blessings, never stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a smith & wesson
And all my niggaz in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a mack-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, told ya
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustaz
No matter how you try, niggaz never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me strikin down the block, hittin corners
Mobbin like a motherfucker, livin like I - wanna
And ain't no stoppin at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw
[kane]	yeah! come in now man
Now I wanna see what my man shyheim gonna do with it
[shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from staten island
{*ah mister cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is gettin hard, word is bond, I swear to god
I even got caught tryin to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good christmas, so who is santa claus?
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin lot
In front of my buildin I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
[kane]	this how we gonna do it, hold up cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[shy]	staten island in the motherfuckin house
Whassup wu-tang clan in here or what?
[kane]
Hold up cee..
Now what's the bullshit niggaz been saying
Dont try to act like martin now with that ""i was just playin!""
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catchin wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, ?lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, whittaker when he fought chavez
Cause when it comes to goin against kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nuttin happenin
Non resistable, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon? sound good

Well, I got a little rap thing I wanna breeze through
[Kane]
So may I release you?
[Shane]
Oh oh, please do
[Kane]
So Lil' Daddy, my ace, my brother
Get on the mic and let's rock with one another
[Shane]
And, here comes the six foot four, the rough and raw
to blow up the mic with rhymes you like
I strike the stage in a rage and burn just like a twelve gauge
shotgun, cause son, the Shane is not the one
The noise bringer, humdinger, funky rhyme stinger
Bring your girl to my show and I'ma swing her
The Lil' Daddy got it down pat, YEAH
I'm like the name Heavy D, I sound fat
Word for word, line for line, UH
I gets mine and show I'm poetically in-clined
If rap was made by ? then redeemed because
you ain't got no ahhhhhice creeeeeeeeam
So take a seat in the rear
Don't dare to compare, cause I swear, you gets nothin here
The way you see me knock out the next brother
You'd think my moms had a talk with LL's mother, huh
Aiy-yi-yi-yah, momma mia
Man I burn the next MC like gonorrhea
Knock the boots on a girl named Althea
Then pull her friend by the name of Maria

So may I release you?
[Kane]
Oh oh, please do
[Shane]
So Big Daddy, my ace, my brother
Get on the mic, and let's rap with one another
[Kane]
When I grab the microphone and shout
You gotta spread out, spread out, spread out, spread out
I'm ready to rip it apart, I hit em with one of the rhymes
I'm rough in a flash, trash, bash, crash, smash slash mash
Run for shelter, no one can help ya
You pushed up on a heavyweight, when your rhymes are welter-
-weight that's right, wait, because you're not fitted
*singing* You're never gonna get it, never gonna get it
UHH, I'm what you call a rap legend
And definitely the last MC to be present
Don't even try to take mines
You fuckin new jack, you still got price tags on your rhymes
Yo what's that sayin that Hammer says uhh
U Can't Touch This, just like a pimple yo I'ma bust this
I'm like Steven Segall, _Out for Justice_
As for competition, pssssssh, what's this?
You're not prepared too, rappers are scared too
Confront this, cause you know damn well you don't want this
Some good advice is just break out
Before I treat you like a fast food resteraunt and take-out
As soon as I see the microphone yo I'ma, seize that
Squeeze that, a battle, you better, freeze that
Cause if you go through the Wrath of Kane, uhh
Not even Lisa Fisher can ease the pain, so

Let's take a trip down memory lane
With the game talker, native New Yorker
Gators on my feet, formerly British walker
Yes love, that's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Parlay with your crew at the corner store
Carrying a boom box æ??il your arms were sore
We be wildin' on the corner free stylin'
Or politickin' æ?´out doe we see piling
Or either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it
Lying bout skins that we didn't get
Slow moving at paces through the rat races
The Jordache look and fat laces
Making moves any type of way
I remember it like yesterday, hey
Chorus
Here's to you
That's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Way back in the days how we used to do
Thank you for the good times y'all
Repeat
Verse 2
Dé???vu, things ain't nothing new
Shorties make me think how we used to do
When you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping
Hold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping
Think it can't happen to you, now could it?
Came to school wearing Puma's went home barefooted
And on the weekends when everybody click
To slide to the deuce to check Karate flicks
Come back around the way after dark
So the crew could embark on the jam in the park
What would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight
Only way to break it up was playing Rappers Delight
And as I sit back watching you
Shorties out there doing what you got to do
I feel for you being sincere
Cause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah
Chorus
Verse 3
Ain't nothing but love I got to give
I don't playa hate cause we all got to live
That negative lifestyle I prohibit
Good life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it
Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing
But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion
Bring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese
Go on with your bad self, Black Caes
Just when the game got the stakes set high
Straight from Bed Stuy, the return of the Jedi
With a jewel cause I'm tired of seeing
Charges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up
Now it's about time we connect, organize and collect
A new wold order's in effect
I send this out to the shorties in the hood
I wanna see you all live good

And when you sweat you're gonna get wet
You're gonna get wet (OW!)
Work it, oh come on now, work it, ow
Now work, come on work it, ow
(You're gonna get wet)
Work it, once agin come on now, ow
Oh, oh, oh, oh now
[Verse 1]
I was the one to say I'd get the job done, I did it and got with it
I must admit it was well fitted
A piece of the pie would be fly
Instead of a crumb for a bum, uh I gotta get some
But I don't wanna be a second hand, middle man
I wanna take a grand stand and
Makin' the cash flow grow
Pullin' myself outta the dirt
And a job ain't nothin' but work

WORK!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!
A job ain't nothin' but work
WORK! WORK!

Mo' money, mo' money, mo' money got get me
To get paid in this trade
And I believe that I can acheive
To make ends meet like a hair weave
Survivin' in this economy people in the wold wanna be
Stayin' in the upper class so you're the path
The rich gets the most and the porr gets so little
And only money love can make it in the middle
I can't let life get the best of me
I gotta take, take control of my own destiny
Control what I hold and of course be the boss of myself
No one else will bring my wealth
I gotta hit them streets to make ends meet
So just bust the style of a hustler
Runnin' scam so damn many people will probably get hurt
And a job ain't nothing but work

All the damn week
A job ain't nothin' but work to me
Workin' everyday
On the subway
A job ain't nothin' but work to me

I won't stop at any cause
I wont stop till I'm the boss

Straight outta the ghetto
None of the Beverly Hills or Flushing Meadows
I made it this far had to gamble, scramble, ramble
Ain't no shame in my game
And I came through like a double bread
But still there's more here
I'm not the greedy I'm the needy, seekin' that financial status
That where my pockets will be the fattest
I'm not gonna be employed when times are hard
I'm so against workin' I wouldn't even take a blowjob
I'd rather do my own thing
I gotta be the one in charge
To make myself live large
A J-O-B is not for me, I don't want no parts of it

I' with this
I' just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
Cause it? ?8
Time to set it straight, knowwhatI'saying
And ain? no half stepping
Word
I' ready>
Rappers stepping to me they want to get some
But I' the Kane, so yo, you know the outcome
Another victory
They can? get with me
So pick a BC date cause you'e history
I' the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it? gonna take a miracle
And, stepping to me, yo that? the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition I just devour
Like a pitbull against a Chihuahua
Cause when it comes to being dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I' different, so don? compare me to another
Cause they can? hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you'e petty
You'e just a butter knife, I' a machete
That? made by Ginzu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you try to be basing
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes Big not little
So define it
Here? your walking papers, sign it
And take a walk
As the Kane start to talk, cause...
<Break>
Ain? no half-steppin?<scratched> I' the Big Daddy Kane
(3 times)
My rhymes are so dope and
The rappers be hoping
To sound like me, so soon I'l have to open
A school of MCing, for those who want to be in
My field in court
Then again on second thought
To have MC? coming out sounding so similar
It? quite confusing for you to remember
The originator, and boy do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I' much greater
The best oh yes I guess suggest the rest should fess
Don? mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraph I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stopping the groove, until when it? the
Climax, and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me acting ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, making it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, ahh shit!
I stop and stand strong over MC?
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
Cause you could scalp my cameo and I'l still have strength
And no, that? not a myth, and if you try to riff
Or get with, the man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'l only ignore
Be sleeping on your rhymes till I start to snore
You can? awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, cause you can? do me none
So, think about it if you'e trying to go
When you want to step to me, I think you should know that...
<Break>
Ain? no half-steppin?<scratched> I' the Big Daddy Kane
(3 times)
I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare
Put him in the rear, back there where he can? see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to be want to be competition
Trying to step to me--must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I' losing?
Psst, picture that...
<Break>
Ain? no half-steppin?(3 times)
Mister Cee, step to me...
The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I' the author
I grab the mic and make MC? evaporate
The party people say, damn...that rapper? great
The creator conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain? easy being me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like letter, man
Now that? dictation, proceeding to my innovation
Not like the other MC?, who are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I' finished, I' sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo I'ma show you who? with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messing around
Play like Roy Rogers and slooow doown
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take
Your title, namely me, cause I' homicidal
That means murder, cause I' about to hurt a-
Nother MC, that try to get with me
I'l just break him and bake him and rake him
and take him and mold him and make him
Hold up the peace sign...
Assalam Walaikum!

Let's take a ride in stride and I'm the guide
with the source, and of course - I don't wanna be the king or boss
I just wanna get my point across
Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
Realize, we on the rise
to the climax, time to take charge
Whoever said we can't live large?
To seek out fortune without distortion
and stop livin for just a small portion
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break
all chains become awake
Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave
and I ain't goin out like a slave
In eighty-nine, I'm livin like a champ
Step out my face, talkin bout a food stamp
Child please, put it at ease
Freeze, it's time to get paid in times like these
We can't take shorts or take a loss
So take it from the Kane and go for yours, because
* Chorus *
Uh-huh
There, comes a time, where we can't be in the rear
We gotta step up front, to get our share
Make the change, cause we're not inferior
For example, there was a black Ms. America
Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
that if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemimah
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
to stay alive, that's the reason I've
came to, motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
What used to be just hopes and thoughts
are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because
* Chorus *
Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go
One more thing
Let's unite together, we can't sever never
no matter what or what-ever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I See Equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
the true way of livin that was really meant for us
So one more time, kick the chorus!
* Chorus 2X *
Ah keep it goin y'all
A Prince Paul, rulin em all y'all
A Prince Paul, schoolin em all y'all

And Tony Tone never leavin the girls alone

Here comes the conquering brother that fathoms and never ceases.
Violators pick up the pieces (uh)
That are left behind as you're left to find
The fury of the five fingers of death are mine,
Rippin' on the microphone, receitin' poem,
Givin' competition a Big Daddy syndrome.
Some step up, (mmm) none kept up (mmm).
They rap a brief moment and then shut up.
Lips are sealed because all of this is real.
I'm not about frontin', I tell the real deal of society (what);
So how we livin,
Like a turkey on Thanksgiving or like Robin Gibbons?
Not to offend,
I just want you to comprehend every message I send (tell 'em),
'Cause I don't understand, I have to wonder, damn,
How could this lifestyle be fun to man,
To see a brother gettin' paid undercover,
Sellin' drugs to one another,
'Cause all the glamour you get is miscillaneous
And all the product you sell is real dangerous
Like um, um, let's say, un, poison,
Destruction to all your own boys and girls who like to buy and give it a try,
Admire and can't deny the high, that's why they soon die.
These are the games that a fool would play today
For our own kind to decay.
No sign of brotherly love,
Just scavengers in search of.....
Chorus:
Another victory (cut and scratched)
Verse 2:
When I'm ridin' in my Volvo, cops harass me.
They never ride past me, they hound me like Lassie,
Wantin' to give me a summons or a ticket.
Huh, I got a place for them to stick it (kick it).
They can't understand to see a black man
Drivin' a car that costs 25 grand.
The first thing they say is ""Where'd you steal her?""
And then they assume that I'm a drug dealer.
Huh, that just makes me wanna laugh,
'Cause now I'm a star and your son got my autograph,
So all the cops on the highway gettin' me,
My name ain't Kieth, so could you please stop Sweatin' me
So I can flow and go on, so on and so on
To all the jams Cee throw on.
Reachin' a summit as you learn from it,
A lesson taught from yours truly, so here cometh
The royal majesty, others have to be
Fully prepared, though they still won't last with me,
So when you hope to hang or even handle,
I'll show the meaning of power and just cancel (period).
Out of order, conquer and slaughter,
You're comin' up shorter, boy, you'll need more to
Compete 'cause the heat is deep in concrete,
Defeat, bring up the fleet, flee 'fore we meet
Or stay away, puttin' new rhymes on layaway.
Then come get this when you're ready for business
'Cause aaaaah yeah, I'm with this (I'm ready).
Yo, Mister Cee, what is this?
(Repeat chorus)
Verse 3:
MC's and enemies I freeze at 32 degrees
Because they can't drop rhymes like these.
Competition never saw none done,
So pay attention as I mention the 411.
Just the other day, I heard a brother say,
""Taxi cabs don't even come my way.
They all be afraid they won't get paid
So they zoom right past and pick up a lighter shade,
And if they stop, the first thing they want,
No more than two people and the money up-front,
Treatin' me like I'm some type of thug.
It might sound bugged but they don't wanna get mugged.""
Who's in the right or wrong?  It's time to unite along
The righteous with a walk in success and be strong.
Instead of lookin' for someone to beef with,
A brother like the Big Daddy Kane is peace with
Rappers of today like (Kid'N'Play),
Hey, even my man L.L. Cool J,
(Stetsasonic) and EPMD,
Public Enemy and (BDP),
Salt 'N' Pepa 'cause we can't sever never,
Wheihter, whatever, we better stand together.
That means unite, not fightin' or fussin' or cussin'.
Save all the base for the pipe and start lovin'
One another 'cause separation is a flaw,
So endure for more and stop lookin'; for....

Mmm.. ohh yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, ohh yeah
Allow me to introduce myself
as the Big Daddy Kane
A smooth lover from around the way
that's bound to drive any bitch insane
[Dolemite (Rudy Raw Moore)]
Well Dolemite is my name
And rappin and tappin is my game
[Kane]
Oh yeah?  Well me tell you somethin Mr. Dolemite
The shit you talkin years ago, I could see
But it's the 90's now and rap is all about me
[Dolemite]
Listen.. when it comes down to rappin
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm the KING so I'm stakin my claim
in the rappin game
Y'know?  For all players, I am the speaker
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin down Broadway the other day
An old old lady came my way
She said, ""I'll be glad when you 'come 18
I'm gonna give you a funkin like you ain't never seen!""
I said, ""LADY!  Why wait for so much time to pass?
I've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass""
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The hoe took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
that, ""Oh Mr. Dolemite, take that motherfucker OUT!""
[Kane]
Well you ain't sayin nothin slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean til that shit was dry
I was makin money before Washington was put on a bill
And I kicked Jack's ass and took his hoe Jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
and made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac
[Dolemite]
Why you long lanky motherfucker
You ain't nothin but a sucker!
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two Colt .45's
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Handcuff lightning and throw THUNDER's ass in jail
[Kane]
Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
Let me tell you somethin
I'm the one that put the M in mackin
Because when you did it you was only actin
I made pimpin a full time job
so bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA
And hung a Home Sweet Hoe sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks
Give a headache to Excedrin and knock the SHIT out of Ex-Lax
[Dolemite]
Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
rat soup eatin motherfucker!!
It was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin game
I was callin whores jives ass bitches
and pimps - sucker ass lame
KANE, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the POCKS in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR
And get out and do the runnin man while you up there
Have the Mumps and the Asiastic Flu
And the Crabs around yo' ass start singin the Yankee Doodle Doo!
[Kane]
Aww fuckit I give up

Come on y'all and feel the groove
Get on down and make your move
Welcome to the funkiest
Brooklyn style, laid out like this
Chorus
[Big Daddy Kane]
I kicks the flavor good, to represent the neighborhood
where I come from, and that's the place of Brooklyn
where the grimies are born and bred
And bullets are like eyeballs, two to the head
[Scoob]
Well is it Brownsville?  Time to represent for the map
where the peeps smoke blunts and like to wear mad gold caps
The party addict about to explode
From the 1-1-2, the double-3 ill zip code
[Big Daddy Kane]
Parlayin on the corner, drinkin 40's shootin cee-lo
It's a Brooklyn thing, aight?  You know our steelo
And for those who just don't know how it go
Play like a substitute teacher and ACT like you know
[Scoob]
So yo, who wanna set it?  You better kick your best G
You and your whole entourage couldn't test me
I represent for the fo' main
And if you're not a booty bandit, then niggaz can't hang
Chorus
[Big Daddy Kane]
Now, let's get straight down to the point
I represent for this Brooklyn joint, baby pah, where we're takin it to
Makin a few dollars don't mean you gotta forget
where you come from and try to be someone, that you're really not
and front with what you got
You're gonna be looked at as a black man still so keep it real
What type of mission can I say you on?
Because you musta done changed to some Grey Poupon, heh
I'm really happy to see you blew up
But always remember my man you grew up
in the PJ's all your life, in a broken home
(Scoob: Well alright now)
Up in the PJ's all your life, keepin it strong, WHAT!
I be the Louis Ave livin, live long lastin lover
Bonafied black brother, word to the mother
Skilled at trades at hand with those who made
the man with support and always stayed a fan
My dialectic style is perfected
in ways you can't imagine rap bein accepted
Funk'll slam like a doper jam, pops
I'm takin mine like taxes with Uncle Sam
So check out the asiatic type of flow
like water in the Nile, but it's Brooklyn style
Chorus
[Scoob]
Yo, this is Big Scoob, no practice
I'm flippin on niggaz like little kids on that mattress
You know my style, Baby Pah from the PJ's
My lyrics so dope, they too fat for local DJ's
So hear me out, no doubt, no need for screamin
My boys in the back, clockin your jewels, and they scheamin
Why did they step to me, I hit em, bow, bu-dow
Knocked out his fronts cause the kid was mad fragile
No need for beef chief I'm rollin mad deep
So pick up your teeth, I got him shakin like a leaf
Not tryin to scare you, I just wanna aware you
I bet you won't even look at my face (WHAT WHAT WHAT) I dare you
Yo nigga please, yo I'm nice with these
while you're guardin your grill, I'll be beatin up your kidneys
Me and my boys with the fat tec 9's
with my joint cocked back, in case a punk tried to take mines
Where I'm from there's no need for hesitation
We cock and squeeze, now where's the doctor for this patient?
He's drippin blood and now he's down to his last breath
But he won't make it, cause he knows that my joint is def
The ill, type of Brooklyn artist
who rocks the har-dest, regard-less
who you know and where you're from I pull your file
(How?)  Brooklyn style

Mister Cee [intro]:
I be the cruddy one that they call the DJ Mister Cee,
with the whole Wolf Pack in the place to be.
Better known as the Chocolate City.
So Scoob Lover, huh, are ya with me...?
{Scoob Lover:}
Yo, I break punks up like a fight. Give me the mic, I'm hype.
(Damn kid, you're starvin' for life)
Cuz people be tellin' me, brothers be gellin' me,
tryin' to get fame from my name but they chumps and they Butt-soft.
They know I'm wilder than a dog with hot sauce.
A mic, a stage, a crowd, and I won't stop:
I set it off and get live like an alarm clock.
People thought Scoob and Scrap was just a nickname;
now that we rap, we sell more records than cocaine.
Awww, shucks, now I'm back from the down-low,
here comes Scoob with the currrr-ly afro.
No chemical reaction, no need for askin', pure satisfaction,
my last name's Jackson.
You slip up, I get ill -- my boot to your grill,
my nine kills, I'm Big Scoob from Brownsville.
The world's greatest lover, the chaaaaa-clate brother...
Chorus:
Who's the committee? (CHOCOLATE CITY!) 3x
Scrap Lover are ya with me?
{Scrap Lover:}
Yo, I drop science kinda like a pigeon;
over rough tracks I tax any midget with a small digit.
Smooth and mild but complicated,
I put the crowd to to smashed like a driver that's intoxicated.
Rappers write rhymes, and talk about guns and jail,
but wouldn't squeeze a lemon in a cocktail.
Don't say ""huh?"" or ""what?"", and don't ask who,
cuz if you hear me, I must be talkin' to you.
You probably thought I couldn't steal it, cuz I was a dancer,
I didn't have a chance, but ya'll can kill it.
You gotta be off your rocker,
I'm lettin' suckers know that Scrap got more soul than Foot Locker.
And if you heard I got skills, believe it's true;
suggest for Pete Rock, for reminiscin' over you.
It's not a threat, it's a bet, cuz hey,
the last sucker who tried woulda been 25 today.
Chorus 3x
Big Daddy are ya with me?
{Big Daddy Kane:}
Yo-yo-yo-yo, look out, get out the way!
Here comes the K the A the N the E -- huh, ya better flee.
Cuz I don't need no hoodie to be hard, shoot:
I'll kill a nigga in a three-piece suit.
I don't be havin' it so the rear I'll attack,
a size-15 to the buttocks, a-matter-fact.
A hard-core blow to the face I'll provide,
to give you a Crooked eye, just like St. Ides.
Leave you home and you must be screamin' and yellin';
not een Kool Moe Dee shades can hide your swellin'.
I bring it rough, tough;
I said that I was Browner than Bobby, so you know that it's good enough.
I'm untouchable to rappers my size.
You dreamed of beatin' me, you better wake up an apologize.
Some claim to be a Daddy or Poppa,
but with me, you'd have no Ranks if your name was Shabba.
Chorus 3x
Now you know you'd too like to be with it...
{Li'l Daddy Shane:}
Shane, I cause pain, I make it rain.
I'm wearin' and tearin' down to the last grain.
Ha, I'm not a chocolate brother, but I dont' mourn,
cuz I swear this vanilla kid got it goin' on.
So don't even step to me if you're worth nothin',
because I just might hurt somethin'.
My competition thinks twice, cuz yo, for a young nigga, I'm kinda nice...
{Laree Williams:} [singing]
Ooooooooooooohhhh! Chocolate City are ya with meeeee?!

Nor does the growth of our young world
Yes the children, be buildin, each boy and girl
Cause you are the cream of the planet earth
The new birth, now take that for what it's worth
And give the child room, to blossom and bloom
Livin large, it's your destiny to consume
To take flight and ignite to a brand new height
Cause that's your goal in life - am I right? (Yeah!)
To start reachin, come on each and every
single one of y'all comprehend what I'm teachin
I said listen up, listen up, listen up youngster
Learn from a lesson that the Big Daddy brung ya
It's nothin but knowledge, I shall bring to you
And I'm not Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo, but I know
""children, children"" - ""are the future"" (variations 4X)
""children, children"" Where we goin now?
Take my hand my child, and let me show you how
Cause I'm here to help..
.. those who need Knowledge of Self
Young brothers and sisters, considered the cream
that must rise to the top and fulfill the dream
And there are desires that we all want to achieve
but remember, respect is most greatest to receive
And we don't have to gain it by bein TOUGH
Or sellin our own kind that cooked white stuff
So bring your negative mind from out of the shade
Find your true self and let's all get paid, because
""children, children"" - ""are the future"" (variations 4X)
People, people, why we live illegal?
Your life just ends short and you know that there's no sequel
(sequel) They'll say that it was fun while it lasted
You run wild, stickin up and gettin blasted
Pregnant girls livin solo, on the welfare
Cause your so-called man said go to hell dere
And young brothers that could be tryin to rap
Instead, are out boostin clothes at the Gap
Now what kind of life is that for a child?
Runnin wild livin foul, hey, change your lifestyle
Get some knowledge, and open your eyes
Just take a little bit of time,
how fully you'll come to realize, that
""children, children"" - ""are the future"" (variations 4X)
[Kane * singing *]
I believe the children are the future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all of the beauty they posess inside
Give them, a sense of pride
to make it easier, let the children laughter
remind us how we used to be

Bound to grasp, Samurai, on what they call each other
Erasing all errors, get worked to pall bearers
I'm talking caskets, coffins, I'm the bastard swordsman
That cause the loss of massing organs
Fear factor, here after, disaster
Climb like the stairmaster, coming through, clear a path of
The raw aggression, that'll take your best on
You start talking tephlon, then you switch to Revlon
Nigga, choose ya weapon, hope you got your vest on
Talking Superman shit, when you ain't got ya S on?
Heh, get ahead of who never, your skills too technical
Leave nothing left for you, but residue, the state of vegetable
The mad swagger, do flaunt it, my dick and you want it
Only question now, is ""nigga, who want it?""
Cause once trouble said (like that) trouble dead
Boy, don't make me have to pull out this double edge

My sword crash through your breastplate, splash the blood on your scared face
Drops leave your trail in the snow, showing the clear trace
Behind a punctured steel, they bodies rot
Arm and leg missing, head laying near the chopping block
An experience, that shattered ya spine, break spirits
Same shit that fucks with ya mind, you hate to hear it, nigga
Def man world is silent, he hears nothing
But we punish those who play dumb, years bluffing
Floods and bloodbaths, up on elevator shafts
Many rivers choke and body will float it like raft
Spark wires from auto-fire, verbal and slang with gats
Screws filled with casualties, wherever the tanks was at
Conflict iminent, prelimenary attack
Everyone's a target, so cemitaries are packed
A solid nigga, drink liquids and gas you up
Hit you with a stupid flying drug, then pass ya cup

Swing your partner, I'm about to start the
dance across the land, the Kane will scar the
people of our community, cause we're soon to see
the future of the world to be without unity
So brothers and sisters, let's check our history
to reveal what's been hidden a mystery
Because we're headed for self-destruction
And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when
one black brother sells another one dope
And he can't cope, so he dies without hope
Many of us live on this level
Mislead victims who dance with the devil
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
Guns are bein bought over the counter like candy
Comin in handy for chumps to act manly
Once before they were only for the law
But no more for sure, lookin at a L.A. gun war
Even in Brooklyn, lives are bein tooken
The Bronx is dyin while the box is steady cookin
Capsule after capsule, settin a trap to
destroy all our kind without a hassle
I couldn't kill my brother, about a color
or cocaine, not even over a rope chain
In this world I'm considered a rap rebel
to correct those who dance with the devil
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
There's no survival
Bodies come in D.O.A, Dead On Arrival
Everytime someone ships in artillery
begins the game wonderin who will the killer be
There's no war, so the Navy must wanna see
drugs and guns shift into our country
So we can shoot each other and sell each other death
and imprison all the other ones left
So it's time to start to rise
We can't be uncivilized, we gotta realize
that bein the baddest doesn't matter when your life is had
So let Michael Jackson be _Bad_
No time to devestate, we gotta elevate
to a higher level.. than dancin with the devil
""Dance dance with the devil""
""Dance with the devil""
This is the dance with the devil!
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
Lookin at the fall of our new generation
makes me wonder about the Emancipation Proclamation
We're considered to be free, but did slavery devour
when we're still slaves to mental death and power
Misled and unknowin, people are goin
more and more beneath, instead of growin
+Express Yourself+, was said by N.W.A.
so stop givin trouble a play
Because those who chose to oppose never rose they all froze
at thirty-two degrees to enemies
that already tricked em and made em fall victim
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, just look at them
What we need is peace and love and more love
but I don't see none of the above
So one for the bass and two for the treble
(come on y'all) Don't ""dance with the devil""
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
""Dance with the devil""..
""Dance with the devil""..

Game is all natural, yours is synthetic
So while you sittin' there tryin' to get your words straight
I bag more dimes than workers at the herb gate
Use tight D, on top of tight G
Want it done rightly, girlfriend invite me
I foresee what you hoping,
And say the right thangs to get you open, then I get you open

Drop these and got her, that Kane he's a mother
The God don't minimize, I enterprise, when I rise
In the thighs, make æ?¹m see doubles like geminis
So, bring it on me no sweat it

No theatrics when the Kane approach
Put you in more positions than a football coach

Walk through the club with the girls lockin to me
It's all love in here baby now sock it to me.

In case I wanna taste that
Comfort specialist, is as easy as this
Ah miss, yeah duke you better hold your on to her wrist
I start roamin like car phones, and
Just can't control my hormones and
I make a move on a ten, and go and get a friend
So I can put my man in

Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because I love a young lady that's beautiful
but one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane

Crisp and clean with no caffeine

And when I turn her back on, you'll have to say

And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac

Ain't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie

And I promise that you'll never forget

I shove deeper than the voice of Barry
to make you hit high notes like Mariah Carey
It's like a Morris Day jerkout
to put you in more positions than a Jane Fonda workout
I'm ready to tear down walls
You say let's chill, but to hell with that,
I'm not Aaron Hall, so..
Chorus: repeat 4X
Give it to me, give it to me

[Big Daddy Kane]
I paid the cost to be the boss
like with that HIV rumor they tried to toss
But I'm so good with the women that if I ever caught AIDS
a woman doctor'd find a cure just so she could get laid
So never fear my dear, just come on over here
I practice safe sex, with girls I lay next
In other words, the J-hat's on the head
Cause I'm too sexy for AIDS like Right Said Fred
So can touch you there, hah? Hah?
I like to take my, time, whenever, I'm
massagin my fingers through a girl -- ooh-wee
I leave her wet, just like her beaver had a jheri curl
Then I begin to hit those skins
So baby doll, let let me in
* sample of Q-Tip going ""uh, uhh, uh, uhh"" from _Check the Rhyme_ *
And if you're the slight bit tight from virginity..
.. vaseline on me!
Chorus: repeat 4X
Give it to me, give it to me
* sample of Q-Tip going ""uh, uhh, uh, uhh"" from _Check the Rhyme_ *
(Give it here.. -> 4X)
[sample of a sex scene from a movie]
[Big Daddy Kane]
Just another pervert that loves to flirt
with a skirt so at a concert girls stay alert
Cause I be hoppin on em just like a frog
I run through, a Luke video, like it's a smorgasboard
I start sweatin, my back gets to humpin
then I thump and I thump and I thump and I thump
I don't carry a gun but I'm packin somethin lethal
One of the last she-BOINKIN people
So come on Miss Thing don't front
You got me on a hunt, and you know what I want, that,
U-S-S-Y, wait, that's not the way, oh
Pass the P's like they used to say!
And when I give you this fat one
You gotta guard your grill.. honey nonononononono, not that one..
Because I give girls the grand slam
I'm like a radio station: CONTINOUS JAMS
Chorus: repeat 8X
Give it to me, give it to me

When I'm in motion it's just like the flow of the ocean
The weight of the words swerve and curve
My style flexes bigger than the state of Texas
Quick as a Lambourghini, smooth as a Lexus
I guess that makes me the top of the line
Oh yes I'm the most prime of all time
Cause as soon as I pick up the mic and begin and the lyrics just start
to flowing, ahem ahem, coughing couldn't stop me from going
On with the rapture, so that I can capture
your mind with state of the art music made to adap to
To knowledge the God on the groove
Because when my tongue moves I just loooove that I'm smooth
Do it with these and in times I leave reas
to give em a little of thje flavor that please
As I, school in the who in pursuin and doin and reignin again and the
gutter and stutter and killin and chillin collectin the rent and
jammin and slammin and damn it's
Too much for one mind to comprehend
A pure blend, the way that I make words mend
And, the way that I be doin rappers in
Michael Bivins couldn't make these Boyz II Men
I play, somethin verbally, capable to murder the
average MC, the tough ones I'll burn third degree
And if you're thinkin that I'm takin a beatin
You're sure to see the Pink Panther speakin
Verse Two: Q-Tip
I'm a native New Yorker, I pitch a lot of porker
When I get my ride, I be the grill squawker
Tip's a smooth talker, I love Alice Walker
So get off the dillz and step back you little hawker
Better yet you hooker, you wanna show I book ya
The highest way I took ya, is youse a good looker
Queens is residential, I make the presidentials
Over instrumentals, I utilize the mentals
First saw Big Daddy at the place called Union Square
If you wnet in by yourself it was a terror
See, I could do that cause my crew is kinda phat
Outside we had the toolies, out West you call em gats
It's that, oh thanks chat, well let me drop some more shit
Bring your bats and balls and please don't forfeit
Cause you won't get away, your status will be stank
You can ride with me G I'm goin to the bank
To meet up with Kane, up on Dollar Lane
You get the idea, cause page times is near
So rappers see they bug cause they really can't handle
Position from the rappin, cause some of them be slackin
Not in this sport of thought we block out the devil
The three different flavors, you know we on the level
Verse Three: Busta Rhymes
Check it out, uhh!  As I come down and get dumb
Yes roughneck, swingin along with the drum
Swimmin in the, track, retaliatin thorough is how
I react, Busta Rhymes will attack
As you feel the pain, bass kick impacts to the brain
gotta make a mega migraine
Whattup?  To the Big Daddy and Tip
My trip, flip the rhyme, then I dip
Hey, hip-hop, cool, bust the interlude
Wack do ya on the stage gettin booed
This structure it takes, bust the angle of three different flavors
on a young raider choc well that's my vocal fader
Keep my volume on extra boom!
All the braids in my neck symbolizes that I want room
Word up, huh!  Here I am, damn
Dragon slayer stackin layer after layer
This jam will be ran while the record flim flam
WIggle your front pram, to the runnin man
Sam, Busta, Rhymes, comin on time
L.O.N.S. did, rip a new design
Flavor one, taste the unborn baby
Flip before you move or catch a bad one baby
CHiggy change chump, the oversized puff
Busta pump you and the love, and then I rump
Emotional stter point, for the wild
Busta buckwild musically direct from Strong Isle
Unload, catch you like smell later
Dig on your taste of the third flavor, rrrarrrRHHH
RARRARRRRH!  Direct from the lungs of the dragon, uh!

Oh, I originate and create the great to dictate
And regulate chumps and set em straight
I get my point across because the boss is truly yours

I crush rappers for the hell of it, defeat, I never tell of it
So anything else you heard is irrelevant
(You're not on the level) man, you're not even close to me
(Step to the Kane) and get bagged just like grocery
So spare yourself the misfortune and proceed with caution
Cause I don't just burn rappers, I torch em
With a skilled-out style that's mad diesel
And I got hemorrhoids from shittin on so many people
I crush those who oppose with blows to your nose
When it comes to my crew (that's the way love goes)
The Chocolate City for Black Cesar Incorporated
(And all of the soft get faded)
So before you step to me use your head
And you better think about it more than Special Ed

Swing your partner, I'm about to start the
dance across the land, the Kane will scar the
people of our community, cause we're soon to see
the future of the world to be without unity
So brothers and sisters, let's check our history
to reveal what's been hidden a mystery
Because we're headed for self-destruction
And you know that the government, doesn't give a (fuck) when
one black brother sells another one dope
And he can't cope, so he dies without hope
Many of us live on this level
Mislead victims who dance with the devil
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
Guns are bein bought over the counter like candy
Comin in handy for chumps to act manly
Once before they were only for the law
But no more for sure, lookin at a L.A. gun war
Even in Brooklyn, lives are bein tooken
The Bronx is dyin while the box is steady cookin
Capsule after capsule, settin a trap to
destroy all our kind without a hassle
I couldn't kill my brother, about a color
or cocaine, not even over a rope chain
In this world I'm considered a rap rebel
to correct those who dance with the devil
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
There's no survival
Bodies come in D.O.A, Dead On Arrival
Everytime someone ships in artillery
begins the game wonderin who will the killer be
There's no war, so the Navy must wanna see
drugs and guns shift into our country
So we can shoot each other and sell each other death
and imprison all the other ones left
So it's time to start to rise
We can't be uncivilized, we gotta realize
that bein the baddest doesn't matter when your life is had
So let Michael Jackson be _Bad_
No time to devestate, we gotta elevate
to a higher level.. than dancin with the devil
""Dance dance with the devil""
""Dance with the devil""
This is the dance with the devil!
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
Lookin at the fall of our new generation
makes me wonder about the Emancipation Proclamation
We're considered to be free, but did slavery devour
when we're still slaves to mental death and power
Misled and unknowin, people are goin
more and more beneath, instead of growin
+Express Yourself+, was said by N.W.A.
so stop givin trouble a play
Because those who chose to oppose never rose they all froze
at thirty-two degrees to enemies
that already tricked em and made em fall victim
Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm, just look at them
What we need is peace and love and more love
but I don't see none of the above
So one for the bass and two for the treble
(come on y'all) Don't ""dance with the devil""
""Dance with the devil""
""Dance dance with the devil"" * repeat both 4X *
""Dance with the devil""..
""Dance with the devil""..

I'm about as bad as you can get
Comin' from Bed-Stuy, that's where they do or die
Forget about the lions and tigers and bears, oh my
It's not a fairy tale, a myth, it's a musical uplift
and I'm the wrong one to mess with
I roll on rappers like a Cherokee, bake 'em up merrily
just like the cooks at Sara Lee
Erase, replace, disgrace, and chase, unlace your face
and place a neck brace, about-face
And get to steppin', because my lethal weapon
is blowin' too fast, while you're slow as Catherine Hepburn
What you need is a little more speed, style and flavor
but it still wouldn't save ya
So to the rear, step off and let the man flex
cuz I can hang tighter to the groove than spandex
I snatch the mic whith grace, always with a plan
and Cee'll cut the recored up like Edward Scissorhands
Rock the soul shack, I can't hold back
Four years standin' and I still got the knack
Cuz I remember when I first did it
the comments that were goin' around from the next critic
Like ""Yeah, he sound alright, but still will he hold?""
And now my black ass is still here like Billy Joel
One hip-hopper that don't have to sound proper
My broken English you can still distinguish
And I don't have no image or no gimmicks
and I don't have no bounds or no limits
The Kane'll keep goin', and growin', and flowin'
and showin' any MC, I got the best finesse to manifest
Cuz I pull cards like some type of retard
Hittin' MCs hard, and any other Rass Claaad
I'm the predator to any competitor
Scorchin' and damagin' and stompin' et cetera
And any MC that tries to test me
I'm swellin' up his jaws mor than Dizzy Gillespie
Crushin' all dreams you thought were possible
I turn into nightmares you have in the hospital
I couldn't count the rappes I be servin'
If defeat was sex, huh, I'd be a virgin
My match ain't been found, movin' around, breakin' 'em down
where the ground, never the clown, how that sound?
Don't get gassed, cuz boy you won't last
so take your crippled rhymes and put 'em in a cast
You're too pathetic, bring in a paramedic
to heal your sick rhymes, cuz man, you ain't poetic
You're just a cheap little hooker and I gotta overlook a
MC that's wack, ya little bogger
And stand clear of the mic that I'm rippin'
as I'm......???
And get your jury and a good defendant
cuz I'm servin' a death sentence...

Who, come again , I
That you can't deny
For the while I stayed, laid back in the shade
Just like a silhouette, however still a threat
Once again, I return just to get my groove on
Bag somethin' that's a size 7/8 and move on
It be nothin' but dime girls I sport
Only time I hit a 3 be on the basketball court
What you thought, the wrath was about to end
Nah baby, never that because I'm out to win
So what if he came back , he ain't even hittin' though
So why you standin' there with yo' nails bitten low?
MC's tremblin', I plead innocent
But then again, things can get menacin'
Ladies and Gentlemen it's the world renown
Come on ya'll let's get down, Dark Gable's in town

Put your hands up high if you testify
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
Cause I give it all I got when I rock the spot
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
Ain't gon' be no looking tight, we gon' party tonight
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
One hundred percent proof, help me raise the roof
Are you wit' me? (Definitely)
Verse 2
It's somethin' æ?´out that Kane that I just ain't buying
How can his rap be solid when his flow is liquefying?
He keep it on beat, plus he keep it street
Plus he keep it sweet, I mean his shit be complete
Thank you love that's right keep it real for me
As I run it down to you all skillfully
Because it ain't hard to tell who's the liver one
Got æ?¹m all shooken like Allen Iverson
See, you talking now but you ain't sayin nothin'
I keep you listeners hittin' the rewind button
You thinkin', maybe I'm the one to bring it to
But, I don't think that's the wise thing to do
Another casualty with the audacity, thinkin' that he can last with me
Fast to see how I massively, drop skills gradually
Hold it down like gravity, naturally
Chorus
Verse 3
I come wit' the flows that go down like water
Some of y'all just ain't got your game in order
Hmn, looks to me as though you're simpin'
Playa hata's that's attemptin', to be the grinch that stole pimpin'
I cram to, understand you, what's your angle?
You don't want to tangle
Actin' all brand new
Nothin' that them can do, when I roll up like bamboo
And dismantle, handle, everyone I ran through
Baby, you can count on me, a sure thing
I be all inside your hood, just like a drawstring
The wack, I restrict æ?¹m, rhymes I kick æ?¹m
Girls I just stick æ?¹m, whose my next victim?
Thinkin' you was ballin', now I'm callin

Don't look at me funny, Kane cause, yeah, I said it

Besides, when you're kickin a rap
The only other people you can see is Scoob and Scrap
So y'all get the girls, okay
But I bet you wasn't gettin skins scratchin for Shante
And the first time a record skips
You catch an attitude and always tryin to flip
Now ain't that a bitch
I swear one of these days I'm gonna pull the power switch
Cause I'm always breakin my neck
10 in the mornin you were sleepin on my sound check
And when it's time for the show
I'm supposed to go (Big Daddy) (hell no)
Am I a man or a machine?
Or just a fat kid who don't supposed to be seen?
Don't you know you wouldn't be so amazin
If I wasn't helpin you out, you black raisin
And you got the nerve and try to complain
Makin a record sayin 'it's hard bein the Kane'
Hmm, but all you gotta do is rap
Try carryin some console cases on your back
Well, I'm through with breakin my neck
Until you learn to show your DJ some respect
Because without me you'd be butt-naked

Now put your weight on that shit here

Here's a little food for thought,
as I tell it, cause if it happened to this cat,
then it can happen to you,
do the knowledge
[song starts]
I was sittin' outside double parked after dark,
I think it was the corner of Nostrand and St. Mark,
That's when this stray cat walked up to me,
Now I was sure he would be,
but you woulda thought he'd know me,
tellin' his life story to me,
he said 'Yo Kane', since way back in his life,
days of Rappers Delight, yo he was after the hype,
he rocked the Kangols, Adidas when Run and them had that spot,
when I came out, he had a flat-top,
and when Naughty came out, a couple years ago,
he even tried the braids up in his hair, but they ain't hear him tho,
vexed and down, you know next he found,
Heavy D was blowing up, so then he tried to gain extra pounds,
no thanks to that, they ranked him wack,
only thing that's left to do, was to go gangsta rap,
so now he rhyme about the keys being sold,
the G's being fold, the trees being rolled,
now sure he should, he started acting like he from the hood,
talking thug game and had his record sales doing good,
and so now, you on the road to riches,
referring to the womankind as hoes and bitches,
yeah, you the man now because you rap is for ?????,
but you got your 7 year old daughter listenin',
the twist begin,
when that the image you projecting,
it starts to reflecting on your shorty cause she checking,
[Chorus X2]
Do you really know,
what's the path that you really need to go,
and what example you really need to show,
the good rep or the hood rep,
while she's walking in her father's footsteps
It be that excess drama, wonder rhymer,
that could make one rapper, convert to, gun clapper,
that acting buckwild, boy you know that ain't your style,
plus your thug profile is now reflecting on your child,
you thinking that it couldn't happen,
but then it happen,
and now you're rappin, came back to haunt you,
because you want to,
be in her face puffin' li with your crew,
you even let her take a sip or two upon your brew,
instead of tryin to shed light, to keep her head right,
so that she wouldn't do the things that the next kid might,
oh now you never did consider tho,
your kid could go,
trying to do the things she saw you do up in your video,
you went upstairs thinking that she wasn't able,
slipping, left your glock sittin' pon the coffee table,
so as you hang, with your gang, doin your thang,
BLOWE! unexpectedly to your ears the shot rang,
came down, never thinking that you'd see what you saw,
right there, layin in blood across your livin room floor,
so now, as you sit in grief, total disbelief,
cause everything that ever mattered,
to you is all shattered,
instead of concentratin' heavily on what your rep be,
you should have been thankful for your child like Cheryl Pepsi,
cause if you would have stayed aware,
to whose in your care,
she wouldn't be no casualty to your career""
[Chorus X2]
Where did they find you?,
you came into this game and let this new trend blind ya,
A&R's was wrong to sign ya,
you gotta be true to this game to stay in the art,
but guys like you get bent apart,
because you ain't got it in the heart,
representing who? you better not be getting new,
how you gonna be guerilla when you never been up in the zoo,
your whole persona's theatrical,
ain't nothing bout you natural,
here, show me now, how many gats you pull,
cause when you talk that talk,
you gotta walk that walk,
or leave it up to the real OG's up North,
cause those who dramatize, realize, and be advised,
you couldn't handle 3 to 5,
cause many seeking fortune and fame,
got caught in the game,
thinking the thug status was supporting the claim,
all you gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks,
but relax, cause this is just wax,
tell em again,
you gangsta acts be guerillas on tracks,
but relax, cause this is just wax,
one more time,
y'all gangsta acts y'all be guerillas on tracks,
but relax, this just wax, nigga, damn

And Little Daddy since you my brother
get yo' ass on in here
Cause we gettin ready to take things down the line
Here we go one time
Prepare yourself for MC terror
And don't make the error of tryin to come near a
rapper so smooth and swift with the gift of gab
to grab the mic, cause I'm sorta like
Vincent Price, but you never been so nice
So back up off me, I'm seperatin men from mice
Kickin ass in every committee, city to city
Until both shoes are city
The regulator innovator dominator creator of data
Plus an imitator assassinator
Lyrics don't display a too don sweet
Hard as concrete, and always on beat
Steppin to this, you're not allowed
You keep frontin on the stage like you're rockin the crowd
Snatchin the microphone real proud
But your rhymes are so booty you should write em on White Cloud
So next up down the line, Scrap Lover
[Scrap Lover]
Aiy-aiy-yo, the microphone's mine
But I prefer peace, so the road'll get rough when
a toy MC, gets the heart to pull a bluff and
there's no laughter, cause the one that I'm after
is smashed, for that reason you have to
make sure each and every lyric is harmless
Cause if not, you won't be able to calm this
Brother from Brooklyn, made to fit a groove
And prepared for the unexpected, to make a move
So put up your girl, and let's see who's in trouble troop
And if you got a sister, then make it a double scoop
The capital S the C, the R-A-P
stands for me, cause I'm the
only MC with an original rap style
You disagree, you get put on the Scrap pile
So stay off the set, with George and Jet-son
You never seen a dancer who rapped well you met one
Now spin the Wheel of Fortunes or be wise and stay back
Co-host my show, like Pat and don't Sa-jak shit
or get ate like oats and barley
Save your Sweat for Keith, and the Beef for Charlie
So next up, goin down the line, Scoob Lover
[Scoob Lover]
Yo, the microphone's mine
It's the S y'all, to the C y'all, double-O B y'all
Well god damn it's me y'all
Jump back, kiss myself, I'm so fly
Sip a brew or two, cause yo, I don't get high
I might wave hi..
.. at a pretty young girl that walk by
But yo, you all that, you can't stop?
A-with the weave in your head like a mop?
You must know karate, cause your face look chopped
Now back to the subject of the matter
I eat a lot of food, but I won't get fatter
Let me see I'm slim, my hair is well trimmed
And when I'm low-key I throw on a brim
But I'm not conceited, when hangin out I need it
For when trouble comes then I never have to meet it
I'm intellectually spoken, I'm not jokin
What are you, smokin?
You be hopin wishin and prayin
to be like Scoob but what are you sayin?
Well it takes style, charisma, class
Fuck up on the Lover, and I bust your ass
So next up, movin down the line
Mister Cee
[Mister Cee]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Mission, to make DJ's feel the wrath
So here's a paragraph, written on behalf
of the ruler, dictator, DJ ambassador
Makin a massacre, you couldn't last through a
round of combat, where my left arm's at
My mouth with the mic in my hand, when I attack
I shake and bake or fake a snake
Take em and make em ache and flake, I break like an earthquake
When I erupt, MC's I corrupt, to be blunt
I'ma tear shit up
So next up goin down the line
The Little Daddy Shane
[Little Daddy Shane]
The mic is all mine
MC's crawl by when they see this tall guy
Six foot three huh, nobody's small fry
The Little D-A double-D Y
The S-H-A-N-E, yes it's me
You better believe there's no comp and I'm certain
So if you try to battle me, then it's cur-tains
I'm no joke, the wrong one to provoke
One false move and KERRRRRR-ROAK!
So take it easy and slide on greasy
Cause I'm more rougher than hair when it's peasy
I'm more rougher than steak when it's raw
So keep that in mind, mon cherie amore
Cause I'm a lover you find quite young
And Brooklyn New York, is where I'm from
So keep it on and you don't quit
That supercalafragilisticexpalidopeshit
So next up down the line, Ant Live
[Ant Live]
Yo, the microphone's mine
Yeah I took it, I ain't gonna give it back
And it's a fact that I can swing, I'm not a new jack
Got the mic in a chokehold, you won't hear a peep
Then I put it to sleep
I see a lot of brothers got razors in the place
Not Al Pacino, I don't need a Scarface
But I know, if some shit goes down
I'll turn the whole New York into Bucktown
My face ain't real Scar'red, cause I real hard
And I ain't no bullshit bodyguard
Walk the streets to New York and stay alive
All I need is my loaded four-five
And sweet and deadly like a killer beehive
And I can stalk in Fort Greene park and survive..
And my name is Ant Live
[Big Daddy Kane]
Now that's what I'm talkin bout
That's EXACTLY what I'm talkin bout
Put your weight on it fellas
Anyway you can get back to work now
Get back to your god damn jobs
And we outta here, love peace and hairgrease

I'm from Brooklyn, New York City
I be the Earth motherin', smotherin' MC's
Sha Queen covering 360 degrees
See I blow like the wind when I flow to this song
Cause a riot like Kaiser like that then I'm gone
I bring the fire burn it down to the ground
Think of dissin' me, Kane will leave that ass rotisserie (What)
Earth, wind, fire we be those elements
It's evident, as we come to represent
[Sha-Queen]
I feel the need to get iller than
All these fuckin' wack Mc's, realest Bitch that ever been
Dropped the hit single that was flying through the roof
I'm lyrical living proof, you can't handle the truth
After you heard me spit, still convinced that you ill
Who you tryin' to fool me or yourself, bitch for real
Everybody know the deal, you ever get a hunch
To fuck around with Sha-Queen, then I know you out to lunch
Break that meaning down, that means disturbed in your mental
And that's absurd, I kick the illest shit you ever heard
Every rhyme to the last line and pronouns and verbs
Too hard to see with your two eyes, then check with your third
My frequency's not tainted with thoughts of whores
That can only get raw on all fours, with sore back doors
Precisely, far from your average girl
So, sit back and shut the fuck up, cause Sha rules the world, word
[A.B. Money]
Listen there was a man in Brooklyn, New York City
Where the guys are fly and the ladies looking pretty
I'm a let you know, that stuff you pop is junk
Cause when I flow, it's the flava of the month
Hold up don't worry about nothin', tot shit in a smash like crash dummies
This fast money, make me wanna fuck around and blast money
I heard your spot makes a lot and give you props
This deal is hot, runnin' from the cops'll get you shot
But don't sweat it, dry them niggas up like prunes
The war's on like Platoon
Shot through a crowd like a cartoon
Rappin' is fundamental, that's right, re-arranger
Hit you like Mortal Kombat, you in danger
I got the chronic, six million bionic
This rap shit make me wanna scream like Onyx
I'm comin' through, that's right I'm gonna split ya
Soul survivors on this track, we comin' to get ya
Woop, woop, five-o's comin' in the exit
Keys jinglin', nine danglin' to wreck shit
Step into my cypher, haven't you ever heard a
Throwin four five six, ceelo, to one twenty third a
Chorus:
Earth, wind & fire you bout to learn
We can make the world turn, or make the world burn
The three deadly elements for your concern
Cause anything you want up out of life you got to earn
Repeat
See now bring it brother well, well
[Big Daddy Kane]
Since hip-hop genesis, I been at this in the mix
In Bed Stuy tenements, rippin' rappers endless
But I won't sit and dwell upon the things I been had
Instead I appear, and take your fuckin' spot like Sinbad
Now, tell me who shall be first to suffer crucial
If you don't know defeat then allow me to introduce you
So how you want it, coming through beatin' ya down
Watching disaster strike when Busta Rhymes ain't even around
The Prince of Darkness be that one man
That made them Al B Sure lookin' niggas get a sun tan
What I drop should not be followed by anyone else
At times I'm scared to kick a second verse after myself
As I proceed, followers take heed
I made many men bleed, I made hairlines recede
This rap skill here, I destined for a mill-aire
And this is one ass whippin' you will wear, you still here?

I'd love to hang with Red Man but I ain't messing with that bam bazee
The Brat, Lil' Kim, Foxy get that loochee
Especially that cutie representing for the Fugees, go girls
Even the NBA make rap dollars

If so, make sure Shyheim and A + sell a million
Peace to Eazy E, Stretch, and Mercury

We gots to strive to make hip-hop survive
Brothers need to unify to keep the game alive

The fame in the rap game we all want it
In fact by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it
And if you're in it for the millions E-40
I hope you see 40, before you be 40
What it look like, the great paper chase for ends
Lost Boyz being found in Lex coups, Bimas and Benz
East Coast, West Coast unite, let's keep it tight
And everything's gonna be alright
But hold up, it seems we got some hip-hop cheats
Depending on just having catchy hooks and beats
Rappers using their skills recently I haven't heard of none
Me, I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson
And yes that I do, I'll shatter you
It don't even matter who, I'll make them all show gratitude
Fools, acting like they don't know the rules
Need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin' jewels
Now they say, is Mr. Kane coming back to dominate
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Damn he still pumpin', just when you think he ain't nothing
That kid just keep coming back, what is he the Terminator or something
Lord I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Finally I reveal it, party people they can't wait until-
Starts to boom out, so every rap consumer
Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni
I sting it, booyah, to stop the half steppers tryin' to wing it through ya
Don't make me have to bring it to ya'
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds
Right now get down for the crown, mess around get pound to the ground by the sound
And let the more experienced entertain

I stay afloat with a note, the way a boat oughta
I'm too poetically inclined, one of a kind
True and divine the genuine, breakin a bond and gettin mine
so freeze, I'm makin it flow with ease
And droppin the funkiest lyrics that ever been known to MC's
Cause I can recite it fast, or even rap slow
Huh, man I can just talk and my shit'll flow
Because I mastered the rhythms of winnin lyric
Hit em, just the flow itself'll tell you that I did em
So let the K-to-the-A-to-the-N-to-the-E
show you the meaning of real harmony, as I float
Float.. float on
Float on.. float on.. (repeat 2X)
Peep this
I'm always on the down-low, smooth and mild
But when it's time to get wild, huh, you know my style
I drop lyrics wham bam by the gram on a jam
and gooooooood DAMN!
It's like a disaster that nobody goes after
Rappers turn ghost like Casper
Cause battlin me, you'd only meet your fate
You'd probably come out better tryin to fight in Kuwait
To be smart, would be not to start
Not even The Wiz can give you that much heart
Rap is like an art.. and man you know
that kind of makes me like Michaelangelo
Not to sound conceited, or either to boast with what I said
cause I'm too modest to ever lose my level head
But if I ever got bold and said I'm higher
I can give more reasons than Earth, Wind & Fire
Many follow in the footsteps, tryin to get a rep
of a lover and a smooth black brother
But I'm knockin imitators out the box
Because you couldn't copy Kane if your name was Xerox
I'm like the God in light, some of my writing might
be too much for your mind to explode like dynamite
And if it sounds good to you then get on it doggone it
Capture this like a Kodak moment as I float
Float.. float on
Float on.. float on.. (repeat 2X)
In this third verse, I'll make it sure mental
See the way that you serve rap's like a death penalty
So back up off me, ain't nobody stoppin Kane
I'm shittin on rappers like I never been potty trained
That means defeatin deletin and beatin
while all the tenderonis I'll be meatin and greatin and treatin
And welcome to a new Terrordome
When I come to roam, you know Daddy's Home
Rhymes come at you full powered with might
They call in the SWAT team when I start to write
and declared my lyrics illegal weapons in every state
So I can get five to ten for carryin a Papermate
Just a little bitty taste of this'll burn so bad
you'll wanna call me the Big Daddy Inferno
So don't even think about a battle, I sail without a paddle
In other words, I FLOAT
Float.. float on
Float on.. float on.. (repeat 2X)

It ain't hard to tell
The flow of the Kane is movin em real well
I build and excel and plus I rap like hell
Lyrics generate, break through and penetrate
Connect like an interstate, now let me demonstrate
I grab the microphone and put the dap in quick
You start to tappin and snappin and clappin
then rappin'll happen
And then I display, poetry, the right way
and rock the Gladys Knight to the next Morris Day
I get sexy like Marvin Gaye
and other times, I might wanna hit em hard and say
somethin exquisite and clever like a wizard
Hit em like a blizzard if you missed it
turn to your friend and say, ""What is it?""
or what was it, because it, was too fast for you to bust it
So pay attention to how the Smooth Operator does it
Just acknowledge the sound
Get on the good foot.. UHH, and get down
[Kane]
Look
The thought of competition, I don't have the faintest
Cause if I'm correct, I kicked them all in the anus
So I don't care if you step to me in three flocks
The men that's all pumped up like Reeboks
Cause I bring down the swelling, just like alcohol
Makin em all fall like the Berlin Wall
Then I apply pain just like a migraine
Pssssh, man, don't even try Kane
A lyrical catastrophe, a disaster see
Nobody gets on after me
Crushin MC's is how I get my joy
So when one tries to battle I'm like, hoo boy
Class in session as I give the lesson
to prove to another rapper that I rule in his profession
And it's nothin new, that the Kane is your ruler
Cause back in the days I used to call you Sundullah
Now it's a new time period, rappers are still fearin it
and the crowd is still cheerin
with the new Black Ceaser that came to town
with one purpose - to make you get down
[Kane]
I start to flow, slow, and then ohh no
I gotta pick up the pace and go
Go relatin and statin what I'm creatin to straighten MC's
that I'm debatin terminatin as the Kane keeps them evadin
So step over, cause ain't no leftover
remains from the Kane I drained the last brain
Speak like Oprah, attack like a cobra
Turn your whole year into a _Red October_
Lyrics are sweet like struddel, at the same time brutal
Your rhymes remind me of the noodle in umm
CHOP SUEY, soft and chewy
My rhymes are kickin like Bruce, you're just Hong Kong Fooey
So +Enter the Dragon+ as I start to raggin
all the competition that's on the bandwagon
I take the groove around around around around around
around, so get down
[Kane]
Yo, get out your seat and jump to this
Throw your hands in the air and pump your fists
The name of the jam is get down so let me see you do it
And show some unity in music
We gotta show our young ones the right way
to avoid crucial poison and the price they might pay
So I keep on teachin the children to follow the
Power Equality, Allah C Equality, PEACE

to feel jubilation, a musical vibration
Instead of the feel of paranoia
Thinkin to ride or break out and someone'll floor ya
Good grief, another beef at a concert
The rappers are gettin a rep behind the people that's gettin hurt
The way the fights at the shows are happenin
you might as well let Mike Tyson start rappin
You see we have to realize the main factor
is to have peace and let the violence cease
So don't throw your fists up, unless you're gonna pump em
in the air, and scream oh yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?

Check the lyrics that's flowin right over the tongue like a machete
My silk drawers are sweaty so you know the Kane is ready
to go to work and my job for the evening
is to pick up the microphone and rap to relieve them
The party society, groovin in a high anxiety
There's dancers by the variety, so go 'head and try it G
As I do body work like Midas
And I can remove the slightest, case of arthritis
or even rhumabotosis as I heal you with the rhythm
cause the remedy for the party people standin around is ummm
dancin and havin a ball
So live life like Michael Jackson, +Off the Wall+
And wiggle your bodyparts, and start to party hard
Lettin the rhythm run through like a trolley car
Here's a sound you can get into
Uhh, and now it's on you

Now just hold on for a second baby
I gotta put my shades on for this
Yeah, we gonna keep this here broken down for a while
and just toss it up like a French salad, yaknahmsayin?
Umm, aiyyo Bob I need you to pump that bass to the FULLEST
Hold on Mike, we gonna get to you in a second

Lots of lust, between the two of us

I mean to be all honest, that is, but now.. hmm..
well let's just say I'm not ashamed
Now in my lifetime I've been all around the world
(Round and around and around)
From city to city, from state to state
And of course, from girl to girl
(Ooooooooooh-eauuuuuuu-ooooooooooooh)
And I believe that I've played every game in the world
that one man could possibly play (don't play with me baby)
And of all those games, you're the only chip on the table
that's made me feel this way (aiy-yi-yahhhhahhhhhhhhh)
Now I realize that love takes time
and trust is somethin that you have to earn
(Oooooooh, you gotta earn it baby) mmm
Well I'm prepared to give you all of me
but, I need the same in return (ooooooohoooo you know you got it)
These are some things that I've been meaning to say
And for my concealed feelings I've come to realize
that I'm to blame (arrrrrrrrre you sure)
So I have to take a little time out to get together
Now baby, I'm not ashamed

[Big Daddy Kane]
You know just yesterday I portrayed my life as a player
(mmm-hmmm) Looked at every woman as ahhh..
as ahhh.. as just a one night affair
(One night love affair)
Now all of a sudden I feel this change that makes me lonnnng
for some type of commitment (don't you want it)
Nah, since I said _Ain't No Half-Steppin'_ (talk to me)
Aww yeah, I'm with this (c'mon)
And let's become two of a kind, a perfect pair in which
all feelins are the same (c'mon)
All love and respect
And never ever, feeling ashamed

SURPRISE!  Guess who's on the rise?
And competition, I'm takin, and breakin em down to size
I operate around the clock like city bus
Never take five, cause yo when you rest, you rust
Be advised, that I pack heat for beef
I'm knockin brothers out the box, and knockin out teeth
Twenty-one years young and I got the knack
(You got it!) to attack and scoop girls like a set of jacks
Ruff rhymes that rag any rap herb
Built by the best to bust swerves like a sharp curve
Fifty percent on wax, no matter of fact
every nine out of ten rap acts produce a wack track
Twice as nice, but smooth as silk
Somebody writin for Scrap, is like givin a cow milk
I release, to make it hard for the fellas to cease
cause I'm the type to make noise, I don't make peace
Here's a new jack, ready to SWING
And bring the hype type of freestyle rhyme for the crowd to sing
Some say there's a party, but it looks like a job to Scrap
I catch bodies with a nickel-plated rough rap
Me and ?Slap?, we run together through the city
The nitty gritty, always together like titties
By any chance that I do get burnt
You better believe that I'm comin back, just like a tax return
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go y'all! (6X)
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go!!
[Scoob Lover]
Move over to the side, let a slim brother wreck it
It's that Scoob Lover kid, so pull up a chair and CHECK IT
When I get wild like Heathcliff, or Dennis the Menace
It's like food to a fat man, finished
I bust your head like a apple (A APPLE)
And pour the blood in a jar, tell your moms that it's Snapple
And wait around my way for your crew, who's next
Cause I be lookin out my window with a nine like Malcolm X
There's no comp, they all got stomped so
Dream on.... dream away.... WELL OKAY!
And play like Shante, and _Have a Nice Day_
I drop rhymes that go boom (BOOM!)
And I can get funky like a high school locker room
Don't even think that I'm country country bamma
Scoob is hittin harder than a heavy heavy sledgehammer
I rock songs to make your grandmother dance
My rhymes are more together than a girl in biker pants
I'm never backed up, I never once had a fronter
Boy I get more beeps than a roadrunner *beep-beep*
I never sweat the girls when it comes to a phone call
I got things sewn up tighter than a football
So skip to my loo or get stomped by my crew
Brooklyn's in the house and ain't a damn thing new
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go y'all! (6X)
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go!!
[Big Daddy Kane]
Here comes the Prince of Darkness ready to spark this
and show the people just who is the hardest
Ruff and rugged, kind of similar to a nugget
But yet and still, I manage to keep the groove, smoove
Rebel for wreck them rappers I dissect them
Cause anything I say on the mic will affect them (HOW?)
So bad, they gotta run for shelter
So rappers take flight like they work for Delta
They know I ain't havin it, styles with no crab in it
Fakin and flakin it child, you're sadly mistakin
Cause who's a rapper here that Kane rip on the mic
and start flowin *ZOOM* Yo yo yo, where you goin'
That's how they flee from me, the B, the I-G
Damn man, you know my pedigree, huh
The gangsta, murdera, killa to ya
for sure endure to injure him or her
The breaker the taker money-maker never a faker
My lyrics are built like Schwarzaneggar
So all my competition gets destroyed
You need to put your weak rhymes on steroid
For you to ever to press up on the mightiest man
to rip a show and flow, provin that competition CAN'T GO
Because I do all, it's easy for you to fall
I move all rappers like my name was U-Haul
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
Here we go y'all! (6X)
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap""
""and Mister Cee""
""Well it's the Kane""
""bring me on, and ah""
""Scoob Lover""
""bring me on, and ah""
""Scrap Lover""
""bring me on, and ah""
""Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap Scrap Scrap""
""Well it's the Kane""
""bring me on, and ah""

""bring me on, and ah""

""bring me on, and ah""

I'm the Kane so you know the outcome
The microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner
Hip hop to me Re boxing to Roy Jones Jr.
The genuine, search and you'll find
That on the microphone I can handle mine
Here's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill
When it's time to rock the mic like Al Scratch I get ill
I come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight
Effects on MC's are similar to kryptonite
Water flows that be hard to distinguish
It's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this
I'm marvelous at the art of this, even if you got assist
stepping to me is a lot of risk. I release skills that's abundant
to explode and drop on you like flight 800
Chorus
Keep it moving world renown
showing and proving
That we can hold it down
Verse 2
Here's a percentage of that old vintage
Macaroni flow but its mare than an image
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya , Let me school ya
On what it is, straight up square biz
Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring
Last thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing who the king
Asiatic non equivalent to any
Plus I play the game a more harder way than Penny
The plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise
That it comes from what I vocalize
I'm the best you can get as I hit you with
The stroke of death And I ain't even broke a sweat
But this is where I draw the. line you're sure to find
Lyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind
What's being caused is many MC's I'm seeing lost
The hip hop laws should be reinforced
You made a record this year, Oh you're hot
Something fishy about your style, who flow you got
You thought that you could hold me down no you're not
Now back up off me, here I come to blow the spot
Chorus
Verse 3
Alright, here I come to get some
But instead you don't want the love to spread
I heard that jealousy and envy is a dum one's tool
so daddy says nothing he keeps his cool
I been through your tribulations and conflicts
Anything possible to keep me out the mix
But ease back, boy you better freeze that
Where my rivalries lack I'm still nice with these Black
I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted
And be another statistic
How many more to try, is sure to die
Slaughter I, all that playa hating only makes me fortify
to get the papers to me is a necessity
And I don't want a piece of the pie I want the recipe
I can't lose with what I use
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues
Don't get it confused

-> _It's Hard Being the Kane_
[Big Daddy Kane]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
And I won't have to do no-body work
The minute I come on stage and take position
A demolition, where rappers catch a bad decision, huh
I start to swingin it, puttin my bad thing in it
Soon as I start flingin it, girls'll start clingin it
People'll start singin it, noise oh I'm bringin it
To show and to prove to the people
the man that really is the king in it
Cause I take the cake like Hostess
No, not the one you wanna play high post with
Warm it up Kane, warm as a snorkel
Snatch the microphone and do a nigga somethin awful
I give him the rhythm-a-jazz pizazz finesse and yet
the flavor to jam and slam the land
I flip the script like nobody can
It's like they lack the crowd to get live
and raw from all the brothers who smothered the mic
They're frank with force, cause you know, Kane comes off
See me and the mic go together like neighbors
And if that's too fast, here's a slower flavor
You see.. I.. am.. the.. man.. to.. stand.. top.. brand..
No.. band.. at.. hand.. and.. yes I can can, yes I can can
rip the microphone to shreds
Buck buck, rough and tuff, and a little bit raggamuffin
For havin a rapper that try to battle will stress me
You shouldn't address me cause you can't impress me
So don't test me, boy, I say you better move over
Yeah, yeah, huh
Many people tried to say I fell off
He went R&B, now his rap is all soft
But if you say that on stage, I'll prove you wrong
And wax that ass, rappin off a love song
Cause with the street in all battles I'm still hard
like a mallet, servin competition like salad
I'm gonna give you some damn good advice G
Break out, before there be some sugar honey iced tea
Cause now you're comin in the danger zone
There no man, can withstand, or hold his own
I burn a rapper so bad that it bruise
even if you put a condom on the mic that I use
That won't protect ya, I still can effect ya
Cause I flip the script, like a movie director
I'm makin the non-believers believe what I'm dishin up
And people that's still

[Kane]	I ran into a young lady Maliya last night
[Riley]	Word?
[Kane]	Must have been her husband's payday
[Riley]	Heheh
[Kane]	because she bought me this here brand new
diamond link that you see me with on
[Riley]	Mmm
[Kane]	Smooth, you knowhatI'msayin?  You know why?
[Riley]	Why Kane?
[Kane]	Cause I get the job done
Chorus: repeat 2X
""I work"" (3X) ""I work.. baby!""
[Big Daddy Kane]
The question at hand, is how do I love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because I love a young lady that's beautiful
but one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
and a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the Chinese cuts
but I'll take 'em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like Martin Luther King, I Shall Overcome
I get the job done
Chorus (+ Kane says ""I get the job done!"" every two lines)
[Big Daddy Kane]
Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushed into becomin some Ku Klux wife
and no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, I let you know this is a brand new year
so never fear, the Big Daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, ""Oooh I like it,"" just like DeBarge (how large)
Smooth and mild I'll make you smile, honey child
then hit the lights and get buckwild
And when I turn her back on, you'll have to say
like Calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
that came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, I'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..
Chorus (+ Kane says ""I get the job done!"" every two lines)
[Kane]	T.R., take it to the bridge, uhh!
[Big Daddy Kane]
Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm Brown-er than Bobby so won't you be my +Tenderoni+
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
An up-to-date mack that's ready to attack
and prove that I'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH
Girl, you won't disapprove
And I promise that you'll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like Tyson, a Captain like Kirk, no
Employee of the Month, cause yo, I do work
The K-A-N-E is on the J-O-B
An expert, cause I get it D-O-N-E
So lights, camera, action - all hail the one!
That gets the job done

The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up party people cause this you should hear
It's a story of a far-away atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So let's all gather around, because...
(x4)
Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime, they all'll say,
They wouldn't even know what you mean
Cause it's a different program, y'all know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
You can hang at a jam till the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind and all
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
There's a place that this can be done, and yo...
(x4)
What I discovered may just only seem
As something that you find in your wildest dream
But!  on the real tip, you will see
I'm not playing, what I'm saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems, no one says sorry
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa for instance, where there's starvation
But if you come with me, you're sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
Are you sick?
And what the hell is welfare?
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only $5.99
So come ye all and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land, and...
(x3)
Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny, but seriously folks
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
And we don't even need Scotty to beam us up
Because...

It's the man with the silk drawers stuck up his buttcrack
Don't even front and try to ask who is this
cause my name rings more bells than a Jehovah Witness
Stronger than Listerine, moppin up rappers like Mr. Clean
Oh Lord, the Kane just hit the scene
Booyaka bo buck, rappers have no luck
Cause when I come through, I'm catchin wreck, like a tow truck
Cause ain't no way in the world the Kane could ever, fade
I'm stayin on top of this thing, in order for me to get, paid
And anyone comin to me for a battle is gettin, slayed
Whenever it comes to the lyrics I'm rappin I got it, made
So back up off me, cause yo' rap
have no hap' so slow dat and act like you know dat
Cause you can dream about bein this up to par
But not even Johnny Mathis can tell you what your chances are
Competition I'll drill em, and definitely outskill em
To make the long story short, I kill em
Cause I face em like Jason, bizarre
And when I come through, it's like tchk tchk ahh
Come on, heidi heidi heidi hoe

Givin you mo', ready to go, kickin the flow, rippin the show
Comin to blow, check out a pro, look at the glow, act like you know
Left the lonely lonely through lyrics loose in me
Leave the lowlife left lingerin lost like ???
Anything you can imagine done to a microphone I did it
Ripped it, flipped it, hit it, split it, let it so dig it
But don't make me get ill, or chill, cause if I exercise my skill
rappers'll hit the floor like Johnny Gill
The smoothest soloist, with this to exist to bliss
and diss who risk to test this
Cause this ain't no game, I treat you like
a picture of my ex-girl, and rip that ass out the frame
I come pursuant, pursuant, pursuant, pursuant
and step it to him, to him, to him, to him, to him
I leave a rapper's career ruined, ruined, ruined, ruined
And watch him fade like my voice is doin, doin, doin
Ease back when I attack
Your poetry is wack so don't ask for no slack
Cause I'm tell you straight up, I'ma bring it son
You want +Poetic Justice+ go see John Singleton
Because a battle ain't no thing to me
And I don't look nothin like Tarzan
so don't think you can swing with me
Just let the Kane take control, I'd like to know
if you really ready for some super dynamite soul!

So what's this? A new attitude, you're tryin to act rude

If you wanna be a gangsta, join the mafia in Italy
Fakin and frontin on stage like you're hard
I hope when you get to Detroit, the real thugs gon' pull your card
Flashin guns like you got somethin to prove G
What, you wanna be in the next John Singleton movie?
You're sayin that you're buckwhylin
But don't convince me, convince the brothers on the Island
Otherwise just forget it, unless niggaz that did ten years
say you a gangsta, I ain't wit it
Yo, I raped his mother, yo, I shot and killed him
Is that what you wanna get across to the children?
I guess you're not gonna be happy til it's for real
Four year old kids, doin drivebys on Big Wheels
Or maybe you wanna see it be more fatal
like Kindergarten kids, tryin to cook crack with Play-Doh
Now I don't mean to take the fun out the jam
I just want some to understand about the gun in the hand
We gotta show our people how to live equal

We gon' pump this up one time
As we set it off a little like this, kick it!
Pump it up now (it's a Big Daddy thing)
As we send this out to New York City
Can't forget the posse down in Philly
Also in Detroit (it's a Big Daddy thing)
Chicago, Atlanta GA
Sendin this out to Miami (it's a Big Daddy thing)
Tampa, can't forget Virginia and North Carolina
L.A. and Oakland (it's a Big Daddy thing)
And the rest of the world as we go a little somethin like this
(it's a Big Daddy thing)
Let it rain let it rain to be put it pain
with nothin to gain under the wrath of Kane
Cause you can't maintain, I drained every brain
to leave a stain plain to remain in my lane
or path or road, until the next one be sewed
That the B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y explode
Just like a bomb in Vietnam, so hit the alarm
or be funky like a underarm
And allow, me to show how, the microphone should flow
Now, competition bow, to me like a Buddha
The teacher, the tutor
They come a dime a dozen but the Kane look cuter
And I ain't about that slouchin or crabbin
so save it -- cause that's one thing I ain't havin
Because the purpose I serve is to please ya
Rhymes will ease ya, like Milk of Magnesia
So bust a pimp without a limp
And I crush any wimp that would try to attempt to umm
get loose I put a boost and used to chill
the comp to Kane, I picked Beetlejuice
""Big Daddy thing"" (2X)
I'm just that ruthless, to leave ya toothless
Cause you're useless, makin up excuses excuses
So never touch tap tangle or tamper
A fearless fly foe'll get slapped with a Pamper
Cause I can dig in your face like root canal
But I'ma chill, won't even dispute you now
Actin wild just ain't my style
Cause only the live will be movin the crowd but see
quiet as kept, not like a starter you
but I can roast an MC like a barbecue
In the Dead Zone, you shouldn't have left home
Steppin to the man, now get the head flown
I bring the terror, horror, there's no tomorrow
Child you shouldn't even bother
to press up, and get broken like a Lee nail
So let me school ya plus scoop your female
Just like a jiggalo but I'm much bigger though
I'm like a hitman, pullin the trigger slow
and smooth to the groove with lyrics that sooth
and improve with every move, that's why you've
been enhanced by the mentally divine
So play football, and let's go the nine
Shorts I take none, cause I ain't the one
In eighty-nine there's damage bein done
And for you to diss me, will be very risky
Cause I make this be, as strong as whiskey
To break and make my foes dispose in force
So y'all can see how me the Kane will just reign
superior, cause I ain't even hearin ya
Save the yang, cause it's a Big Daddy thang
""Big Daddy thing"" (4X, then cut and scratched to end)
And this one here goes out to my man Mad Money Murph
Can't forget Big Sha, Big Therm
And also I got to say whassup to my man Horace
Got Nice and Smooth in the place to be
Mack Daddy Nick, know what I'm sayin?
Can't forget my man Ant Live
And of course the one and only Prince Paul, peace!

Uhh, and uh, Prince Paul, bring me on and uh
Aiyyo Botch, bring me on and uh
Mad Money Murph just bring me on and uh
Just bring me on, yo
This is a world premier and I'm here
A presentation beyond compare
So MC's step to the rear as I break through
Girls say ooh and then skip to my loo
That means dance as I get smooth with
Poetic perfection that you can groove with
Just like a passenger, hurry and fasten your seatbelt
cause I'm about to start broadcastin
the words of wisdom, so turn up the system
loud and clear, I don't want no one to miss one
word to be heard never blurred or slurred
The preferred is absurd, all the damage that's occured
As I break MC's like a lumberjack
Ain't no comin back, you can't get none of that
I'm not the type of MC to be merciful
So if your name ain't Jermaine take it personal
Cause like a vigilante I'm gonna kill off any
sucker MC that tries to withstand me
With the mic in my hand I start flowin then
all competition flee and start goin in
the other direction, run for protection
Cause I can burn an MC like an erection
You're too small kid, don't get involved with
the verbal law for the Nation of Islam
Wisdom I speak makes your head nod
Showin I got the power, and that's from bein born the God
But many doubt my Knowledge of Self
But they're just illiterate, so I don't consider it
Feedin off poison that's pollutin their mind
and that's the reason I don't swine
I gotta maintain, accelerate my brain
and god damn, it's hard being the Kane
Give it to me!  C'mon!
C'mon!  Uhh!
Give it to me!  Give it here!
Give it to me!  Yeah..
This is the proper way man should use ink
But you're at your brink and your rhymes are extinct
Just like a dinosaur, but you never find a more
cause mine'll keep sellin on wax like some kind of whore
Let me inject this, flow of electric currency
for all the party people preferrin me
and spectatin like a tourist, cause you never
saw this style of rap kickin like Chuck Norris
But this ain't Kung-Fu, no I just brung you
a style, that phony MC's were too young to
digest, when I manifest, you adolescent
So sit back, relax, be glad you had a lesson
And this one's for your listenin pleasure
Somethin for all the bitin MC's to treasure
Just like a diary, for you to admire me
before you're put in the Dead Poet's Society
Cool as a draft, droppin math in a paragraph
I laugh as the wrath break in half, your whole staff
But many MC's were able to retreat
Runnin like an athlete, but I got bad feet
So I don't chase ya, nor do I wait to face ya
Nah it ain't in my nature
I just rip shop, flip-top, and watch MC's get dropped
as I manifest in hip-hop
Rhymes I construct are tough like a Tonka truck
And just like lightnin they struck
down on all the toy MC's that annoy
That's how I build and destroy
The poetic printer, rough rhyme inventor
with a groove so smooth you can't help but get into
So I'm advisin competition to flee
cause I can bake an MC like Chef Boyardee
Holdin my own on the microphone
Cause I break bones just like sticks and stones
So let it rain let it rain as I put em in pain
God damn, it's hard bein the Kane!
Give it to me!  Get up!
Come on!  Uhh!
Give it to me!  Come on!
Give it to me!  Yeahhh
Put in a pause, because here's the holocaust
Above all laws, in effect and all yours
Cause I came to blaze a taste of bass of grace
A replace, erase the waste without a trace
My vocabulary will just have you very
dazed and amazed so I fear no adversary --
that means competition
They can't even touch this, even with ammunition
Break out the gauge and go into an outrage
and I'ma still blow up the stage
Cause this is a death threat, but don't let your sweat get
in the way of your vision don't be missin when I get set
to go on a rampage, start a one man rage
Total destruction as I rip up the damn stage
And leave it in ruins from the damage that I'm doin
to prepare the atmosphere, as I put you in
the mood for the Smooth Operator to start this flow
And so..
I crushed and crushed and stomped the comp that tried
to get fly and face the ace I put em in place
Proceed em, retreat em, defeat em, delete em, and feed em, and eat em
and all the rest of that good stuff, cause I don't need em
Only one survivor can remain
And god damn, it's got to be the Kane!
Get up!  Give it to me!
Give it here!  C'mon!
C'mon!  Give it to me!
Uhh!  Put your weight on it

One two, one two
We came here to just motherfucking do
You and a crew
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Canæ?° forget my man, Lik, yæ??ll in the house
Got Fric and Frac in the house
Hey-hey-hey, you got Big Daddy Kane in the house
Juice Crew in the house
Thatæ?¯ right
And my name is the Biz Markie
And we gonna rock a little something like this...>
One, two, whatcha gonna do?
I say yes, yes yæ??ll
To the beat, all
Party-having people guaranteed to be like having a ball
H-h-h-hey
We gonna do a little something like this I say...
Iæ?¦ the rap promoter
I start to motor
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm order
Put me on water, Iæ?¦ a good floater
When I run for prez, you best be a voter
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watch Star Wars just to see Yoda
Or R2-D2 driving down the BQ
When I buy franks, I make sure theyæ?®e Hebrew
When I entertain, and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nice tight see-through
Take her to the crib, turn on the Beta
Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwartzenegger
Maybe Commando or the Terminator
Peace party people, ha ha see you later!
Big Daddy, huh huh, my man my mellow
Get on the mic cause you know you eat Jell-O
Kane:
Check it out, yæ??ll
You donæ?° stop
Keep on
Well itæ?¯ the Kane in the flesh
Of course Iæ?¦ fresh
Oh you thought that I was rotten?
Huh, I beg your pardon
To me getting paid and getting busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance...never!
Could I be weak, why Iæ?¦ rather unique
I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique
That I be using and not many can manage
So a brother like me, I do damage
Just by picking up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out, and oh yo
I get physical, mystical, very artistical
Giving party people something funky to listen to
Thatæ?¯ why the other MCæ?¯ canæ?° swing long
I stomp them out just like I was King Kong
Stepping on roaches, I get ferocious
Supercalifragalisticexpealidocious
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
Cause Iæ?¦ma pimp, hear the primp, yes the emp-
Eror, bringing much terror in your era
I ready, willing and Iæ?¦ able, so bust a move
Never use a barbershop I got my homeboy Smooth
Cooling out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
Like that yæ??ll, itæ?¯ like that yæ??ll
Itæ?¯ like thata-the-that, itæ?¯ like that yæ??ll
Cause Iæ?¦ the prosecutor taking a stand
And, Iæ?¦ cross-examining you my man
The judge and jury, releasing my fury
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
You see, the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic Nobodyæ?¯ Equal
I hate to brag, but damn Iæ?¦ good
And if mics were a gun, Iæ?? be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, Iæ?? be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
Or if rap was a school, Iæ?? be the principal
Aw fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
Itæ?¯ a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how itæ?¯ properly done
Lights, camera, action!
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo afro, Virgo, domino, I go Rambo
Gigolo, Romeo, Friday night spend money on a ho-
Tel, to get a good nightæ?¯ sleep
Iæ?¦ keeping in step
Now do I come off?
Yep.

Give it to me
Get on the dancefloor
Start to clap your hands for
The smooth operator, what more can your ask for
The musical maestro
That's usin the mic so
I can spark up the entire place like nitro-
Glycerine because the crowd is sizzlin
Bobbin they heads to what's said and still listenin
I specialize in fun
And I must know what's happenin cos you're dancin like re-run
So behold the natural born soul, a rhythm
To get em and hit em as I party with em
My job is to make you all feel this
But i'm not don cornelius
I'm just a new black cesar here to please ya, ease ya
Movin and groovin, provin, soothin at your leisure
I don't sing or yell
But my rhymes reach out and touch more people than Ma Bell
The brain of the Kane's so intelligent
You think dancin is irrelevant
And start stompin like a elephant
But that's not necessary, just let the beat carry
You into somethin funkadelic
That might best describe
The musical vibe you feel when I arrive
From the moment I walk through the door
I gotta keep em on the floor
Get up and dance and move your body across the floor
Go on and do your thing until you're feelin sore
(I can't dance no more)
Get on up and dance
(Let's dance)
Get on up and dance
(Give it here)
Get on up and dance
(Funky)
Look
You came in the disco
Thinkin it would be just low
But i'ma make sure you enjoy this show
You won't have a chance to sit down
(Get down)
And listen to rhymes that go the mile like a marathon
A voice that's choice, as strong as sarah vaugh
Swift delivery flowin like a river be
Flowin, but only ladies know my tongue is that slippery
I grab the mic and then we'll see
Who can d-a-n-c-e
Makin the crowd roar for more of what they saw
And I'm sure that I can keep em on the floor
{Chorus}
Oh
Feel like i'm down here by myself sometimes
I'm ready to break this groove down
You're ready
So I'ma let the music just stop
And we gon' get into our own thing for a minute here
You're ready
Break it down
Keep on dancin
(Keep on dancin)
(Dance)
Bring in paramedics to relieve the
Trace of this bad case of dance fever
Cos I can feel the disco heat gettin to me
While the sweat got my silk drawers stickin to me
But I can't stop, I gotta party
Like a gun on the dancefloor and catch a body
I might move real smooth
Then again dance real silly
Just like a hillbilly
As i make sure the beat is kept
So all the party people stay in step
Become a slave to the rhythm
Grab someone of the opposite sex and dance with em
Put your partner on the floor and face em
That shows a positive sign of unification
And if all party goers could make this move
We'd be one nation under a groove
So let's try this, stop the violence
That can only result in peace from what I sense
To be straight to the point
A little love and harmony - mh (it's the joint)
So build a nation, pump the bass and
The treble beyond the level of imagination
So the Big Daddy Kane can endure
And the name of this tune is Keep Em on the Floor
(Everybody get up)

Now, what you gonna do when black caesar comes to surface
My purpose is making sure you bless me right
So I can climb aboard that money train with wesley snipes
Daddy love how I get down ain't no secret
And every night, my backyard is just like the freaknik
What you mean from hot sexy mamas to cool prima donna's

Verse 3
I talk that talk from the gutter my game don't stutter
I can tell you why white milk be making yellow butter
Some cats, they be shifty, some cats they be iffy
So I move swiftly, play the field like ken griffey
Because, I be the all mighty, relax like tai chi
Making it irie
I flow over tracks when the beats are mean
Girls I go downtown when the streets are clean
Make it happen all my peoples
More chips than doritos I know we all trying to see those
So I return to give you more again
Because my name dates back until the game's origin
See what the fact is, is you need practice

Aiyyo what happened last night, did you forget?
You said that you was pushin through my way with some Moet
Nahhh, see I was witcha man Devon from Calloway
He came over with Bell and Fay and a bottle of Alize
The honies wanted to watch me in _Posse_
but the picture was sloppy
Oh that bootleg copy?
Yeah
We tried to beep you before we went to the motel
Word?  Damn, my battery was on low cell -- oh well
We took em to this down low spot
Man skip the part about the journey; did you hit the skins or not?
Oh no question -- when have you ever seen my game go nervous?

Do you know, what you're goin through?
Do you like this style of rap that I'm showin you?
The way I flow for you.. do you know?
[Kane *rapping*]
Yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song
Uhh, aw yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four, gotta keep em on the floor
and put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What I'm used to hearin, I can't believe it's gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices _Weak in the Knees_
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen
is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills, come see how it feels
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin
If my rhymes was in braille, you still couldn't touch em
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right
Here's the news, you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You ain't never paid dues
Be for real, you ain't tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmmmmmn sham
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
*singing* Never to walk in anyone's shadow
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
that battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die -- choose one!
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin sex, the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MC's - are you kiddin me?
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I BLOW
a rapper off the map, with the rap, when I FLOW
then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I KNOW
that all of this is good to go, cause yo
that's the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style caue that is where I'm from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rapppin, is quite fat
I'm lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat, on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies I'm givin em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove, good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmie ones
Watch out Goldie! Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
and none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
with skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than
taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin a comeback, like Puma's!
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company
and Bogart, like my name was Humphrey
When I get through, there'll be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium
I make mad MC's give me my P's
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these
N-U-T's, like the U-N-V's
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-heeees!
Razor sharp, many ways of art
Source rings the chart, people praise the God
for kickin the flows so fantasitic and this one here
We're callin it Lyrical Gymnastics
Uhh, so baby baby c'mon
Aw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song
Uhh, ah baby baby c'mon
Suki suki c'mon, and I'm gone!

Bang biggy bang biggy bang bang, motherfuckin niggaz can't hang..

Where brooklyn at, where brooklyn at
Where brooklyn at, where brooklyn at
We gonna do it like this
Anytime you're ready, check it
I got seven mack 11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten mack tens, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had mc hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie smalls; the millionare, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Little gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin
When I throw my clip in the ak, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the d-e-c-k
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to matteo
Now we smoke weed like tony montana sniffed the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad l's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my god, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
[tupac]	motherfuckin biggie smalls!
[kane]	what you gonna do with it tupac?
[tupac]
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfuckin middle finger
We gonna do this shit like this
I thank the lord for my many blessings, never stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a smith & wesson
And all my niggaz in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a mack-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, told ya
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustaz
No matter how you try, niggaz never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me strikin down the block, hittin corners
Mobbin like a motherfucker, livin like I - wanna
And ain't no stoppin at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw
[kane]	yeah! come in now man
Now I wanna see what my man shyheim gonna do with it
[shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from staten island
{*ah mister cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is gettin hard, word is bond, I swear to god
I even got caught tryin to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good christmas, so who is santa claus?
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin lot
In front of my buildin I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga then tried to slide
And hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
[kane]	this how we gonna do it, hold up cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[shy]	staten island in the motherfuckin house
Whassup wu-tang clan in here or what?
[kane]
Hold up cee..
Now what's the bullshit niggaz been saying
Dont try to act like martin now with that ""i was just playin!""
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!! oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catchin wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, ?lest you're gonna rob me
Like they did, whittaker when he fought chavez
Cause when it comes to goin against kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nuttin happenin
Non resistable, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon? sound good

Embrace the bass as I commence to pick up the pace
And make you motivate, and accelerate
Cause like Tony the Tiger, Iæ?¦ greeeat!
Always seem to come off, hard for you somehow
I mean me being wack, oh come come now
Thatæ?¯ quite ridiculous, so just admit you was
Thrilled, itæ?¯ on your face, and itæ?¯ conspicuous
Not that youæ?®e on this, but my performance
Is rather exquisite, so hard is it
Or supremacy, thatæ?¯ the perfect definition
But rappers keep wishing to be in my position
Know good and damn well they ainæ?° no competition
Huh, I gotta give it to you kid, thatæ?¯ ambition
For you to perpetrate the role of me, the Big Daddy
The Big Father, naah, donæ?° even bother
Cause that would mean you would have to teach
Each and every one idiotic son
Trying to make it, you canæ?° fake it
The rhymes I recite are fully dressed and yours are butt naked
Your speech is weak, while my mine stands strong
So, all hail the man thatæ?¯ here to live long
You know you heard this voice before somewhere
And when I said that Iæ?¦ the Kane, you said æ??h yeah!?That brother that used to rhyme on stage with Biz
Oh heæ?¯ def,?you know what time it is
But this time Iæ?¦ not assisted on the microphone
More like Patti Labelle, on my own
Just single-handed, the mic I commanded
Phony MCæ?¯ donæ?° understand it, and it
Is the real thing like the taste of Coke
So never sleep on me, better stay awoke
Like a gambler in Vegas, I go for broke
To make a long story short, yo I ainæ?° no joke
I take time and care in whatever Iæ?¦ doing
And when I rock a party, I make sure that you en-
Joy what youæ?®e hearing as I entertain
So hip hip hoolay, long live the Kane
I got the freedom of speech to use it anyway that I choose it
So all hail to the music
On exhibit, get with it, now hereæ?¯ my ring
The original supreme being Black man
Point blank, the cream to rise supreme
As those go below like a submarine
Reaching and teaching a lesson that Iæ?¦ giving
Addressing and impressing the crowd, so how we living?
Fine in mind, to decline is out of line
So pardon this brother as I give you mine
To say Iæ?¦ not, donæ?° even diss yourself
Cause at times, I have to jump back and kiss myself
Long live the K, the A, the N, the E
I say the end will be
A big movement, by the time Iæ?¦ through
And thatæ?¯ coming from a Black manæ?¯ point of view
Now pardon me for just changing the issue
But all you sucker MCæ?¯, itæ?¯ a must that I diss you
The way yæ??ll be fronting has made me disgusted
Now Iæ?¦ma set you straight, so so yo yo, bust it
Rappers try and hang and just swear that they can party
But the style that Iæ?¦ using is just like karate
So if we ever battle youæ?®e bound to be through
Because I got a black belt in Rap Can Do
No Iæ?¦ not Chinese, itæ?¯ just rhymes like these
That destroy an MC with black belt degrees
Youæ?®e rocking a party, trying so hard to get loose
Kid sound awiiite, but I canæ?° taste the juice
Therefore, the job is left to me
So I get the party kicking just like Bruce Lee
But I wonæ?° stop there, I still rock a little harder
While the toy MCæ?¯ step and say, Sayonara!
Long Live the Kane! (x2)
Break it down!

Heheh.. yeah right!
Listen, you're just as soft as baby powder
Don't let your mouth get you in somethin
your rhymes can't get you out of
Some good advice is don't even come out my way
You better press up on Chucky if you're lookin for Child's Play
Cause I'm a grown ass man in total command
One of the best to ever be and
no other can ever take a stand
When I kick a verse the scene becomes so scary
that niggaz get quiet like a library
I pick up the mic like a hunter in hot pursuit
Oh you want some of this? Then put that mic on mute
Because you'll be in more danger than Penelope Pitstop
Point blank, you get your shit dropped
I got a death blow whenever I throw
With double impact to take out the whole row
Huh, I start swingin again and again
You'll hear so many ""ooh ahhs"" you'll think it was Boyz II Men
I break down, shake down, proceed down, beat down
back down, smack down, rip down, get down
showdown, throwdown, rundown, come down! *DJ rewinds*
Here's a little message for your own concern
You try to press up on this and get burned
A battle with a non-believe is what I yearn
Damn, niggaz never learn
""Niggaz!"" -> Eazy-E
""This is for your own concern..""
You Must Learn"" -> KRS-One *repeat all 3X*
If you ever see a jam playin you can bet that damn Kane
will make it sparkle and bubble like champagne
Dom Perignon I'm the Don of the set
and I'll bet, that the girls, will agree
That the B, the-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y Superfly feel
like Ron O'Neal, gets ill, I got it goin on
Word is bond, I'm more Dangerous
than Michael Jackson - hah, sha-mon!
So, I don't attract with the wick-wick-wack
So take a step back, you new new, new jack
Cause young boy, all of your rhymes are pre-natal
Mines are fatal, cause I got The Hand That Rocks the Cradle
So stay in your crib pen, before you get did in
uhh, I mean done in, you gets none and
the last rapper to press up on me wrong was..
.. ummmm.. damn it's been that long!
So competin is not a smart decision
Cause I start to dissin, then start dismissin
You're tryin to battle with me well god damn scram
The style that you're usin is as old as a Trans-Am
Update yourself just like an 850
Shift see, oh what's the use you still can't with me
Many MC's tried their best to press up
But I guess, their best, wasn't goooooood enough!
I'm not Robert Townsend but every time I speak
I'll leave a rapper's chest beatin like he had Five Heartbeats
Knockin out comp like Rocky Balboa
And I make more noise than a lawnmower
For my stacks I worked hard to earn (* Kane starts rapping real fast *)
Bein the bigger the better the badder the boss

Yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song
Uhh, aw yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four, gotta keep em on the floor
and put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What I'm used to hearin, I can't believe it's gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices _Weak in the Knees_
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen
is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills, come see how it feels
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin
If my rhymes was in braille, you still couldn't touch em
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that
Rappers today be comin as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right
Here's the news, you lettin the word hardcore be misused
You ain't never paid dues
Be for real, you ain't tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmmmmmn sham
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
*singing* Never to walk in anyone's shadow
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
that battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die -- choose one!
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin sex, the way that I put it in em
And do I crush MC's - are you kiddin me?
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I BLOW
a rapper off the map, with the rap, when I FLOW
then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I KNOW
that all of this is good to go, cause yo
that's the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin to the drum
The Brooklyn style caue that is where I'm from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that
Amazin the people the style of the rapppin, is quite fat
I'm lickin the lyrics and shootin the gat, on the mic black
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin the tone that make the girls relax and moan
Cause all the ladies I'm givin em lots of love
Hittin more skins than a boxing glove, good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmie ones
Watch out Goldie!  Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
and none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
with skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than
taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
Cause Kane is makin a comeback, like Puma's!
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company
and Bogart, like my name was Humphrey
When I get through, there'll be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium
I make mad MC's give me my P's
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these
N-U-T's, like the U-N-V's
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-heeees!
Razor sharp, many ways of art
Source rings the chart, people praise the God
for kickin the flows so fantasitic and this one here
We're callin it Lyrical Gymnastics
Uhh, so baby baby c'mon
Aw yeah baby c'mon, and check the rhymes to the song
Uhh, ah baby baby c'mon

Chorus: (all together)
Well, here we are,
United just for you.
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move.
Verse 1 (Big Daddy Kane):
Na-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up.
The slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up,
'Cause I don't let up or get up or even set up.
On a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up.
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff.
The Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff,
'Cause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'.
Strong enough for a man but made for women,
So come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky.
It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
>From the cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely,
Smooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me,
And not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt
And after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt,
Just to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G.
You're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski.
I'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me,
I can fill up any girls that's empty,
Give you somethin' that's mighy and strong,
But ladies, don't get me wrong
Because you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya
And then catch amnesia,
But the party people can't be denied,
So I remember those who's on my side.

Interlude 1:
Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scoob Lover, my brother.""
Verse 2 (Scoob Lover):
The mic goes around like a 40 ounce.
Now, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce.
I won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk
And, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk,
'Cause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother.
For those who don't know me, I'm (who?) Scoob Lover,
A jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow.
For all the choice cuties, I'd love to say ""Hello"",
So take away the 3, let's stick to 1, 2.
Me and you, now here's a clue what we could do.
It begins with an S and ends with an X.
Hmmm, not the number 6, so guess what's next,
So girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still
'Cause it's about time for Scoob to get ill.
Remeber you dissed, now you wanna kiss,
Write me fan letters, sayin' that you miss.
There's only one rap dance, the cool romancer.
If I had a million dollars, I'd try to cure cancer,
But I'm only here to get illey, ha.
Now, I'm drug free and I don't smoke Phillies,
So come here, shorty, go buy me a 40.
And make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty.

Interlude 2:
Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scrap Lover, my other.""
Verse 3 (Scrap Lover):
You get jacked if you ever try to nap
Ona a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps.
Now, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off,
You know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off.
?Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say.?
You can't mislead me. Why? 'Cause I know the way.
Always gave headahces, never known for heartaches.
Time and effort, huh, that's what a star takes.
Let me give you a true piece of mind
'Cause this rare species is so hard to find.
I'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts,
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts.
Draggin' tattoes is what the girls found,
Two on m chest, one draggin' on the ground.
To all the young ladies that's clean and legit,
As long as I got a face, you got a place o sit.
No tokens for heart-broken turnstiles,
No remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while
Those that's destined to question for a new thing.
Join us in harmony together as we sing.
For all the ladies determined that once was
So jealous, stop searchin' now 'cause....

After that, I was convinced we can do it
until my man Biz jetted and came out with ""Make the Music..""

If they ain't lying they tryin to do some other - wildness
{Big Daddy Kane:}
I know, I know
It's like girls promisin you Thomas's
And can't even cook toast, right?
What I'm tryin to tell you, man, is...
They just ain't no damn good
No damn good
Check it out
[Verse 1]
Now there's this girl named Monique
The type of female that you consider a freak
A big-time player playin like a drum beat
You think her address is 21 Hump Street
She step out every night to swing
With her Lee press-on's and a nefertiti ring
Bamboo earrings all big and lookin silly
With extensions hangin down like Milli Vanilli
And every Wednesday night at the Apollo
First kid she saw with jewerly she'd follow
And Monique would be ready to sleep
With the first kid in a Benz or a Cherokee Jeep
Strung out and givin up the nappy dug out
You're on the critical list, about to pull the plug out
So here, nympho, here's some good info
Stop takin em putts and close your legs, toots
Cause I remember you was one of a kind and a fine - hm
I once was infatuated by the things that you do
But now you're doodoo
It's all about respectin yourself
In order to gain respect from anyone else
Treat yourself like a real woman should
Cause bitch, you ain't no damn good
That's right, there's a lotta young ladies out here
That just ain't no damn good
{Female voice:}
But hold up minute
There's a lotta guys out there that ain't no damn good either
{Big Daddy Kane:}
Oh yeah?
{Female voice:}
Yeah, cause I had to tell one the other night
That his thing had too many 'nots' in it
{Big Daddy Kane:}
What you mean by too many 'nots'?
{Female voice:}
Not big enough, not hard enough, and not long enough
{Big Daddy Kane:}
Yeah, aight
But check this here out
[Verse 2]
Well now, here's another story
About this kid by the name of Corey
A hustler with game tryin to make a name
That was his aim, but his lifestyle was lame
Cause he would front like it wasn't even funny
About his girl, his car, and his money
Pullin out a knot every place
But every single bill had Washington's face
And he went beyond exaggeration
To lie about his means of transportation
Because he said he had a Benz car
Come to find out, it was his friend's car
Talk about simple chronic halitosis
Damn, his breath was ferocious
He had an odor that just won't quit
Smelled like he washed in Oil Of Oh shit
Tellin girls he's daddy long-strokin
(Shit, you must be jokin)
Cause he ain't got no bitches
And couldn't hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches
See, Corey, there's a lot you're missin
Seems to me, you ain't got a pot to piss in
So let's get one thing understood
Muthafucka, you ain't no damn good
{Prince Paul:}
The moral of the story is
The majority of the population of males and females today
Are just no damn good

Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold
Back, or fold cos I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck
Rock the discotheques and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant them
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no
Problem, I can sneeze, sniffle and cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter Imma still come off
Cos rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what is said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
Cos I get ill and kill at will
Teachin' a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up...don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up
Verse 2
Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other
Dancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically
From me, so don't play me, obey me
When asked ""Who's the best?"", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north
And if you still want some...set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope
Cos I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says ""Peace""
So, maestro, yo, hit it
Big Daddy Kane's about to come with it, cos...
[I can't hold it back...]

Chorus: (all together)
Well, here we are,
United just for you.
Our flat-top cuts are new
Because we're on the move.
Verse 1 (Big Daddy Kane):
Na-na-na now girls step up, the quick ones kept up.
The slow ones need to pep up to keep Big Daddy's rep up,
'Cause I don't let up or get up or even set up.
On a a speak freak, I know how to make you shut up.
Gasp your breath as you huff and puff.
The Big Daddy got more than enough good stuff,
'Cause I'm just like secret when it comes to trimin'.
Strong enough for a man but made for women,
So come one, come all, I'm not about bein' picky.
It only takes a hickey to make you want a quickie
>From the cameo haircut man that's dark and lovely,
Smooth and suave, that's why girls dream of me,
And not to flaunt, I love a flirt with a skirt
And after a concert, a little neeeaaah don't hurt,
Just to hear the girls screamin' out wild, G.
You're not a Jungle Brother, but that's some Jimbrowski.
I'm like a pimp, see, and iff you tempt me,
I can fill up any girls that's empty,
Give you somethin' that's mighy and strong,
But ladies, don't get me wrong
Because you say that I love 'em and leave 'em, but no, I please ya
And then catch amnesia,
But the party people can't be denied,
So I remember those who's on my side.
(Repeat chorus)
Interlude 1:
Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scoob Lover, my brother.""
Verse 2 (Scoob Lover):
The mic goes around like a 40 ounce.
Now, I'm-a take a sip, now it's time to bounce.
I won't get tipsy, I don't drink and talk
And, no, I'm not a hoddlum by the way I walk,
'Cause I'm one hype, one brown-skinned brother.
For those who don't know me, I'm (who?) Scoob Lover,
A jolly good fellow, flowin' with the mellow.
For all the choice cuties, I'd love to say ""Hello"",
So take away the 3, let's stick to 1, 2.
Me and you, now here's a clue what we could do.
It begins with an S and ends with an X.
Hmmm, not the number 6, so guess what's next,
So girls, don't barge, don't blink, be still
'Cause it's about time for Scoob to get ill.
Remeber you dissed, now you wanna kiss,
Write me fan letters, sayin' that you miss.
There's only one rap dance, the cool romancer.
If I had a million dollars, I'd try to cure cancer,
But I'm only here to get illey, ha.
Now, I'm drug free and I don't smoke Phillies,
So come here, shorty, go buy me a 40.
And make sure it's cold so the crew can get naughty.
(Repeat chorus)
Interlude 2:
Mister Cee cuts and scratches ""Scrap Lover, my other.""
Verse 3 (Scrap Lover):
You get jacked if you ever try to nap
Ona a rap from Scrap because you know there's no haps.
Now, right from where I left off, to all those who stepped off,
You know you had it comin', the blame is what you slept off.
?Destruction played a part on roll, here's so to say.?
You can't mislead me.  Why?  'Cause I know the way.
Always gave headahces, never known for heartaches.
Time and effort, huh, that's what a star takes.
Let me give you a true piece of mind
'Cause this rare species is so hard to find.
I'm custom-made for all the ladies with guts,
A tall box of hair or rather cameo cuts.
Draggin' tattoes is what the girls found,
Two on m chest, one draggin' on the ground.
To all the young ladies that's clean and legit,
As long as I got a face, you got a place o sit.
No tokens for heart-broken turnstiles,
No remarks or regrets, but I'll burn while
Those that's destined to question for a new thing.
Join us in harmony together as we sing.
For all the ladies determined that once was
So jealous, stop searchin' now 'cause....
(Repeat chorus)
(Mister Cee cuts and scratches)
Outro (Big Daddy Kane)
You don't stop, you don't stop.
You keep on to the break of dawn.

So here I am, boomin like an amplifier
I clear my throat, then I float like a boat
Note for note, what I wrote you can't quote or even tote
Raps are too heavy, sharp like a machete
Pass the microphone, cause Kane is all ready
Grippin to play the part to prove that I'm in command
The Biggest Daddy of em all, and oh, Kane stands for
King Asiatic, Nobody's Equal
or Non-Equivalent, or Natural Ebony
or Now Effective, or Never Ever
Pick your definition and put it together
Cause it still comes out tastin like chocolate
With the finesse MC's never got with
Cause none of them want me to touch the mic first
They know that it only takes Kane one verse
So here's the microphone, show me what you can do
And uhh *yawning* wake me up when you're through
Just so I can go and flow and throw a blow
to show a pro and let em all know
that any MC tryin to be this lyrical
should go ask Smokey Robinson for a Miracle
I wouldn't let a rapper go one round
I'm knockin them down, just like Jim Brown
So Mister Cee, let the music play
And here's what I want y'all to say
Ooh! (c'mon) Aah! (c'mon)

Here's a rap avalanche, MC's travel and
run run for shelter, cause they don't have a chance
Any MC caught talkin out of turn
I straighten em out just like a perm
Now let's take a second, just to recollect it
Give a little shout to the rappers that's out
Like all the East coast, MC's of today
From Run-D.M.C. on down to Kid'n'Play
The ladies like Salt-N-Pepa to Latifah
who showed the power of a woman and me a believer
Now backtrack with the musical jewel
And say peace to the old school
And all praises due to the L.A. crew
You put your state on the map and kept bringin rap through
I can't forget the brothers that's down in Miami
You're still 2 Live if you never get a Grammy
Cause personally I feel who really needs that stuff
If you ask me, it's just a bunch of makeup
There's a lot of caucasian kids that don't even know me
Cause every Billy and Joey is another David Bowie
I guess I used the wrong tools in my rhymes
* ""Superfreak"" * Cause when I nailed my clock, it didn't say Hammer Time
That's not a diss to my Oaktown friend
Just tellin you how it is in the musical biz
Cause I make sure that every rapper in the industry
becomes a friend of me
And Mister Cee, let the music play
And here's what I want y'all to say
Ooh! (oooh) Aah! (aaah)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (nanana)
Ooh! (c'mon) Aah! (c'mon)
Nah-Nah-Nah, Nana (c'mon won'tcha c'mon)

Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
for this somber occasion
Please join us in the mourning of this U-47
It was a great microphone in it's day
until it met it's fate
One evening while it was in the studio
it was struck by the lyrical force of the Big Daddy Kane
So ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
May this microphone, rest, in peace..
[Big Daddy Kane]
Knock knock, guess who? Yes, ooh
The Bigger the B, the Iggah the I,
the Jigga the G is comin through
Yes I'm the one with clout, they're all talkin bout
To be frank, I have the flavor like sauerkraut
The microphone assassinator and furthermore
I murdered plenty rappers and believe that I'll murder more
So if you ask to give the Kane a go
You better treat me like drugs, and Just Say No
Because I utilize my skills to brutilize
And in a battle, man you should see what I do to guys
Whenever the mic's mine, I'll rock a hype rhyme
and come off, like dirty panties at nighttime
Cause any mic that I caress, I finesse
with zest, and just bless, best yet to progress
King Asiatic, no other rapper stands this
You couldn't be a King if you played hockey in Los Angeles
I gets pi-daid, top gri-dade, gotta admit ey
point blank, the kid's stri-daight
Cause when it comes to R-A-P-P-I-N, huh
I got it locked up like a bullpen
""May you rest in peace"" -> 3X
""If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!"" -> KRS-One
[Big Daddy Kane]
Rappers I get em and hit em and slit em and split em and rid em
Acquit em, when I get wit em, you can tell that I did em
I take em and shake em and bake em and ache em and break em
and rake em, you can't awake em from the comatose way I make em
Cause when you're messin with me -- you know what?
You can swallow a live grenade and you STILL won't blow up!
Pickin up the microphone you shouldn't dare
It's like bein on a Stairmaster, climbin and goin nowhere
You're perpetratin like you're ready and able
but couldn't rock a show, if the stage was a cradle
Your rhymes are old as an artifact, and you don't want no part of that
So don't even start it black
Anyone riffin I show them how I'm livin
And give them some of that treatment like my man Michael Bivins
I smack em up, flip em and then shove em down
Huh, oh I-ah-ah-I-ah-I-ah-I don't be fuckin around
To rip this microphone like this today
since eighty-seven I came a LONG, LONG way
To headlinin, all the way from supportin..
.. and I know you've been watchin me Norton!
Through my whole rap career, a lot of young, huh,
rappers sat there, and listened, a lot of young, huh,
rappers sat there, and wishin.. but..
you couldn't see the Kane with X-Ray vision
And just because you didn't see my crew for a few
A lot of people thought the Wolfpack was through
But if you think the Kane and Scoob and Scrap'll breakup
I tell you like Marvin Gaye, ""wake up.. wake up.. wake up..""
Put it to rest, it's best to 'fess
Because the Kane is breakin rappers like the IRS
And consider this microphone the deceased
Now may it rest in peace
""May you rest in peace"" -> 7X
""If this meaning doesn't manifest, put it to rest!"" -> KRS-One

Give it here... uhh
Mic testing one two
Right about now I wanna have a little fun with this
and just talk a little bit of junk ya know
Be-because it's OK, ya know, it's OK to brag and boast
from time to time, ain't nothin wrong with that
So I'm gonna have a little fun with it
Check the Prince of Darkness y'all, here we go
[Verse One]
Four times for your mind the poetically inclined
genuine and divine can still climb
When you thought that I wouldn't go the length
But I cup a cameo and I still got strength
So make room cause I'm sweepin up like a broom
Cause I'm the straight up wholly original yeah that's right mmm hmm
To be blunt and lay my cards on the table
You'll be Gone With the Wind for messin with Dark Gable
In comes the era of the chocolate types
Like your Bobby Brown, Aaron Hall and Wesley Snipes
Including myself in the cipher the Big Daddy Kane is a part of it
AKA, your prince of darkness
[Verse Two]
When it comes to the girls they know the program
Cause when I get through it's pure Silence of the Lambs
So ladies grab a hand and join the caravan
That's bein ran by the hoochie cooche man
Then don't miss a breath of my kiss of death
An A plus in lust while your boyfriend is a F
I come tellin you Tales From the Darkside
And seperate the men from their women like Apartheid
You say am I a, vam-pire
That will react to ya just like Blackula
But when I say Prince of Darkness I don't mean a blood sucker
I'm talkin about a black lover
So mysterious and serious the women are curious
so when I walk inside of a place it's like ""Ooh, there he is!""
But slow down, there's enough of me to go 'round
Huh, I'm givin girls more Temptations than Motown
And tonight's the night for me to get right
and give girls the feeling of love at first bite
So here's a lesson of what the don art is
Taught by the big you know, Prince of Darkness
[Verse Three]
Stop, hold up, pause, quit
Change the groove and funk it up a little bit
Now back to the subject of how the
Kane became the bigger modern day mama wild deep
Now the question is do I really carry it
Huh, well baby I swing low like sweet chariot
Still a few of them thought that I was lame
And then the big brown shah came!
So let me send a dark shadow right through ya
to prepare you for all of the kniky things I'm gonna do to ya
And yes my dear if you got the goods
Then you might just see my face up in your neck of the woods
Ahh word life y'all, a word life y'all
That's how I, shoot off arms just like a rifle
So just, pass the mic and let me spark this
So you can say that it's been blessed by the Prince of Darkness

If you're ready Mister Cee cut the record real loose
and uhh, test test test test, oh yes
I wanna bless the mic, I caress with finesse
Back off the microphone, you can't wreck it none
I'm like a nine, and you're just a Naked Gun
Some type of new jack, steppin in the area
kind of reminds me of Eddie Murphy, Coming to America
But you can't approach this, rhymes are too ferocious
Do the knowledge as I quote this
Freddie Krueger, walkin on Kane's street
Five chapters and I still ain't been beat
Bout time I turned the microphone loose
Anyone after me is just an excuse
Even the level of the devil or Exorcist
can't get next to this
This is mayhem, so competition, say when
You're thinkin that you're ready, so I can just play him
or them, no matter the quan-tity, you don't want to be
in this battle, so just flee
Cause I leave em panickin when I start damagin
Kickin this swift, leaves you stiff, like a mannequin
And frozen, this is a mind explosion
as the chosen flows in, the competition throws in
the towel, my sharp tongue is like a license
I strike like Mike, Tyson I be icin
Breakin the mic in half, just like a psychopath
But still smooth and cool, just like a draft
Leave the metro scared and petrol
Ain't No Half-Steppin', so I don't sweat no MC
cause Michael Jackson couldn't say it clearer
My only comp is the man in the mirror
So any pretender, you never been to
the death zone, this is the wrath, do not enter
These ain't the grounds for MC's to be wanderin
These is the grounds that the Kane is conquerin
Lyrics are bright and recite on the mic to excite
delight, ignite, a bright light and a fright night
for types who bite, to be quite like
the man with mic swingin all tight, but can't get it right
You're just a sloppy, cheap carbon copy
Sent to ride off in the sun, said Kemosabi
As the Kane remains everlasting
With lyrics that's fast relief like aspirin
So allow me to relieve, or breathe contact
your brain and remain like hairweave
Cause I can reach each participant with a speech
that will teach, and have em hangin like a leach
And yes still puttin rappers in fear
So hold it right there, cause this is a nightmare
As I cause a killer scene, and cut like a guillotine
Any thoughts you had about winnin is still a dream
Or more like a fantasy, tell me why can't you see
There ain't a way that you can touch or stand on me
You talk about how many rappers you slayed
But I'm like a renegade, so I never been afraid
so don't say hi to this Asiatic descendant
Just say peace and everything'll be splendid
Peace!
Mister Cee, put your weight on it
Boy put your weight on it, put your weight on it
Put your weight on it
Put your weight on it Mister Cee, put your weight on it!
I'm outta here!

[big daddy kane]
Whattaya do in a situation like this?
Get tough - or get dissed
The job is yours to play the boss enforce the laws
Because the source is knowledge, wanna go to college?
Or wannabe garbage?
It's up to do so what you gonna do
I-i prefer to learn, cause this is for your own concern
You gotta-you gotta earn, however the world turns
So wake up-wake up, to put some sense in your head
Don't be-don't be mislead, use your brain instead
Because-because a brother like me, can't understand you
Playin yourself cheap, like a soggy old pamper
Since i'm-since I'm around, I'm destined and bound
To resurrect and perfect the entire school around
The whole-the whole entourage, a class so large
Under joe clark, ""i am the head [nigga] in charge!""
The man-the man with the master plan for discipline
Makin changes-makin changes, no matter what we twist or bend
You may not-you may not understand what this mean to me
But for your-but for your own good.. just lean on me
""just-just-just-just""
""for your own good""	""special mix""
""you may not understand what this mean to me
But for your own good.. just lean on me""
""just lean on me"" -> *cut n scratched*
""big daddy kane, a teacher.."" (4x)
""special mix""
""goes a little somethin like this!""
..	""special mix"" (2x)
""goes a little somethin like.. like..""
""big daddy kane, a teacher.."" *cut n scratched 2x*
""..teachin a lesson"" *cut n scratched 2x*
""..teachin a lesson to be heard, that's word""
""can I hear a yes? "" (2x)
[big daddy kane]
""can I hear a yes? "" yes! ""why? "" things are better
And we are finally, workin together
In unity, and you're soon to see
Eastside high as a better place to be
The students, the pupils, have morals and scruples
Our learning ability is increased quadrupled
And we're off to a brand new start
I played my part to prove that you're smart
And it's proven, but I ain't movin, I won't be gone
I'm here, when you need someone to lean on
So take heed to this as a blessing and remember..
Ain't no ""half-steppin""
Get in full gear, I'm sure that you'll care
In the long run, when you got pull here
That means authority
""r-e-s-p-e-c-t""  word!
So let knowledge uproot ya
Go for yours, cause we are the future
The ones who rise to supremecy
And if you ever need a hand, just lean on me
* more cuttin, scratchin, and samples to fade*

Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'ma tell about
a minimum length, of rhymes of strength
and power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
sing hoe, swing low, then yo the show
will go on, as I perform
Transformin on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator
""cause I'm so smooth..."" --> Rakim
(repeat 2X)
The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin many and any
competition, wishin for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin and dismissin, listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin hard but ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Kreuger, walkin on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator
""cause I'm so smooth..."" --> Rakim
(repeat 2X)
Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over Miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin em right word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator
""cause I'm so smooth..."" --> Rakim
(repeat 2X)
Now ain't that the pot callin the kettle black
Sayin I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say em and the way I display em
to make them sound different in a way that's gifted
and hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robatussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off!
Competition, I'ma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
a break or rest vacation hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator
""cause I'm so smooth..."" --> Rakim
(repeat 2X)
Ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop
Genuine for eighty-nine
And I still ain't half-steppin, peace!

So, get up and dance cause Kane said so
If you were lounging around itæ?¯ time to get up
Pardon my expression, but Iæ?¦ma tear shit up

That would dare to compare, I do declare
Getting busy is where itæ?¯ at

Cause youæ?®e a featherweight, and your rhymes you carry light

So how could you think that you pose a threat?
You say youæ?®e rocking, how many shows you get?
All your vocals go local on the M-I-C
Mines go a great distance, like AT&T
Iæ?¦ now new to this, Iæ?¦ true to this, nothing you can do to this
Fuck around with Kane and come out black and blue for this
So, yo, go for what you know
Attempt to debate so I can humiliate
We can go rhyme for rhyme, word for word, verse for verse
Get you a nurse, too late, get you a hearse
To take you to your burial ground
Because the Big Daddy Kane always throws down
Correct, I get respect, Iæ?¦ out to collect

To stage a rage is what rap did to me
To make me want to create chaos and mayhem
Cold rock a party until the A.M.
Iæ?£l make a muscle, grab the mic and hustle
While you stand dazed and amazed, I bust a
Little rhyme with authority, superiority
And captivate the whole crowdæ?¯ majority
The rhymes I use definitely amuse
Better than Dynasty, or Hill Street Blues
Iæ?¦ sure to score adored for more without a flaw
Cause I get raw
Everybody get up!  (x5)
With speech like a reverend, rappers start severing
And in my lifetime, believe Iæ?³e never been

between Lafayette and Van Buren, that was back during
the days of hangin on my Bed-Stuy block
with Spence and Mitch, followin my cousin Murdoch
All the brothers were real, goin for what they feel
By the way, peace to my man Sha and Big Neal
Now in ninety-three I'm still bein me
You think my 'fridgerator ain't full of Olde E? Huh
A lot of times I get fly with a suit and a tie
Yeah I went from rags to riches but I still rock the saggy britches
And I don't try to act brand new
Eatin escargots and usin words like ""rendezvous""
The ghetto life I've seen a lot overcome
make a little money and then forget where they came from
Livin a plastic lifestyle, you're more false than dentures
Don't make me pull your file -- stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
So why you wanna be what you're not?
And claim to have things that you know you ain't got
You're just a fantasizer -- spendin all your money
on lustrous pink oil moisturizer
Just to make your hair curly and thin
You say, ""Black is beautiful,"" but then you go and bleach your skin
Money you're worse than Yacub
cause their are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two
Plus you got a bad case of jungle fever
And nmmana-nah-nah I just can't believe ya
It's quite obvious you don't wanna be a black man
So what's next - you're gonna join the Klu Klux Klan?
You sold out to your race and it's a big disgrace
You can't look your own people in the face
You wonder why it ain't no black schools or hospitals
You're makin millions of dollars and it's pitiful
that you can donate to leukemia all the time
But you can't give the Nation of Islam a dime
They mention Muslims, you change the subject
You can't even shake Farrakhan hand in public
That whole busy attitude is a sham
Umm bro, umm brother, umm.. Brougham, stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
""Change the groove and funk it up a little bit""
I look in the mirror, at times I say, ""Damn Black Caesar;
how'd you get to be the woman pleaser?""
Cause I remember when girls didn't notice me
And now they wanna Come and Talk To Me like Jodeci
It's strange, how back in the days I couldn't get with em
Now all of a sudden the honies they wanna give me rhythm
Well I'ma hit it, but still I show no pity
So I hope you don't think you gonna be in my next video
And many brothers I never even ran with
be actin like they been hangin with me since I was a kid
I mean just to get a piece of the action
Man they start rememberin more times than Michael Jackson
But I can't fade to the tag-alongs
that want me to drag em on
Frontin like a friend just so I can put em in
But you cuttin yourself paper thin - stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!
""Stop, hold-up, pause, wait"" (2X)
[Kane] Stop shammin!

Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold
Back, or fold cos I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck
Rock the discotheques and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift MC's stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist, or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant them
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no
Problem, I can sneeze, sniffle and cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter Imma still come off
Cos rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what is said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
Cos I get ill and kill at will
Teachin' a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up...don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up
Verse 2
Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other
Dancin' with the crew so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically
From me, so don't play me, obey me
When asked ""Who's the best?"", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north
And if you still want some...set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat they're feedin' me dope
Cos I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cipher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says ""Peace""
So, maestro, yo, hit it
Big Daddy Kane's about to come with it, cos...

.. nah I better not say the whole word
So uhh, let's just say what make Whoopi like Goldberg
Cause I wanna make you sweat, get you wet
Perform a miracle in this love duet, see baby
I play the game like Keno, plus I know the
+Scent of a Woman+ better than Al Pacino
And when it comes to girls, I show no mercy
They lick me on the chest and say, 'To hell with Hershey'
Now it's time for me to lick that body
and this is no +Ordinary Love+, ask Sade
Baby you're bound to perspire, when I use
the nipples on your breasts just like a pacifier
Honey please, keep your body at ease
And let me see what I can do with those 34 C's
I plan to lick your bellybutton my dear
and let my tongue walk five steps downstairs
The way that I plan to put this chocolate syrup to use
I'm gonna wake up in the mornin with a hairy sweettooth
And now you're under my spell like a magician
Abra-cadabra, good sex and I have ya
laid out, waitin for a big treat
I'm not the Ku Klux Klan but I stay under sheets
And when it comes to sex, yo I'm the illest
Plus I know more +Diff'rent Strokes+ than Arnold and Willis
I make you feel the reel to reel you feel
when I break the headboard down like Shaquille
Then bend over doggy style and just watch me
ride yo' black ass like I was still filmin +Posse+
Then I'm the one that gets the job done
My mattress have more bodies than Al Capone's, gun
When I get through givin you mine, uhh
Girls be callin me back like *69
So come on over here hottie, let me just
'work that body, work that body'
Uh-huh, uh-huh..
Straight like that..

What goes on under the table, why you think your deal is so unstable?
Now, whose the macaroni, A&R's acting phony
Once you make the matrimony, then he start to slackin' don't he
Or could it be the president that's being hesitant
Playin' his artist like a corner workin' specimen
And I ain't kidding you when I say it's political
The way they make a ridicule of artists can be pitiful
You know damn well there shouldn't be no company CO
Trying to show me about rap that's 53 or so
But yet and still they want to add advice, trying to keep their status right
When they should be working records for Gladys Knight
Who shape artists, man they catching rape charges
Once you sign on the dotted line, they lead you in the blind
Then you find, your state of revenue remains the same
Cause you getting less points than Steve Kerr be getting in a game
And just because it be too hardcore to judge it
They won't even touch it, and get to frontin' on the budget
When new artists come out, I can foresee the worst outcome
Cause everybody I know got beat their first album
So I took my contract to a lawyer so he can check it out (He don't know)
Then I took it to Dionne Warwick so she can  read my hand (She don't know)

It's a shame, when artists gotta deal with cheats
They got game, for every young rapper they see out on the streets
You sign your name, they get like Big Red on the Five Heartbeats
Now who the blame, when you starvin' and your record label eats
Verse 2
Preach brother
They say the truth will set you free, but I see signs of treachery
Go on perpetually, here's how they get you G
They use the tricks, just to juice your mix
But cross be in their heart like a vampire stabbed with a crucifix
I had the enemy in my vicinity with the false identity
Of a friend to me to injure me
They ride along just to guide you wrong
Play like they beside you strong, and start to faking moves like Olajuwon
Who side you on, revealing all that low down dirty dealing
I can see your skin peeling it changed like a chameleon
First you believe in them, but once you disagree with them
They try to get Magilla repertoire and that ain't even them
And all those who has betrayed, be fast to fade
Cause they cast a shade, with the masquerade
What's dealt, is low blows below the belt
Lord have mercy, I know how Julius Caesar must have felt
I start to think back when I was just a youth
I should have listened to the words of the God Born Truth
He said, ""look out for black snakes they all up in your cypher
Black snakes you can't see therefore they sneak up and they bite ya'""
They get to flippin' cause they think you slippin'
So remember, don't get to slippin' cause they get to flippin'
And trippin', what's that you grippin', beside your hippin'
You think my heart is skippin', go save that game for Scottie Pippen
Chorus
It's a shame, to see how far left people be going
They got game, to think that all this time you said you know them
It ain't the same, Aah, so now you see the way they flowin'
Now who they blame, ain't nothing but a wolf in sheep's clothing
Verse 3
Now, wait a minute, I'm starting to see lotsa, hip-hop imposters
Is rap a category at the Oscars?
Too much Nino Brown up in your life
Cause since then, man I done seen Wesley Snipes playin' a drag queen
But yet and still you want to mimic the stars of cinema
Pretending huh? So full of it they need an enema
Cause see dig, they all like to talk big
But then they want to renege, when there's a curling iron in their wig
You talking loud and saying nothing, what's the world becoming?
The frontin', now pay attention you may learn something
Now, I ain't knocking you, but come on let's be logical
You know that it's impossible to stop the unstoppable
I would suggest that they, go back and check my resume
Cause tunes that I made yesterday, can hang out with the best today
Peace to Easy Mo, cause he makes the beats to flow
And I grab the microphone and flip it like pizza dough
Chorus
Shame
Now who the blame
I need to be the Mayor, so I can change the things around here
I need to be the Governor, I need to be the Governor

Hah hah, hey hey, laugh now nigga
My man's right behind you, kane pull the trigger
I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hand, you still can't get no cards
You couldn't deal with scoob if we was playin cards
But if I got beef and it's time for code red
My drill is like a hoe, and be takin mad niggaz to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join a army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from?  england, you somebody great?
You burnin scoob, ""i don't think so mate""
I got the style that gets you open like a bag of smoke
I have your friends ""ah-hah man, that shit ain't dope""
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
And play like e.t. and phone your black ass ho-wome
Yo sauce, if you're down with the groo-hoove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove
Verse two: sauce
Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic tac toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder
How you got dope like sauce, money you didn't do it
I write my own with bigger hope, drink of scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
N-b-a style, fann-tastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight I write left-handed
Cuz I like, to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm bookin whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take eddie
If I was fred, I think I'd have to bone betty
Suckin and luckin, hey, niggaz I'm duckin, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So shyheim, if your down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove
Verse three: shyheim
Yo, yo
I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killin
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from u.s.a. to asia to russia
If your shit stinks i'ma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from cali son
My jams be packed like a farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the f in effin foul
The rugged child locks you down like rikers isle
And got more girls than a trailerload with shabba
More super than cat, I'm the punani don dada
So big daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove
Verse four: big daddy kane
Now tell me whoooo is the mannnn?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And steppin to me, thinkin I can be touched?  huh
Not even michael jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That is I thrown ya, scold ya, jones ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What did I just show ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the mexican
The messiah that's feared great, leavin rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none!	huh
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me,
But with with speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better g
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistable, non-competible
No-no-i'm-not-sayin-i'm-the-best, I'm just sayin I'm fuckin incredible!
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So jay-z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove
Verse five: jay-z
Uh, one checkin it two, checkin it three
Check out the j, check out the a, check out the y, check out the z
Hey g!
I'm breaking mc's up like epmd
And these nuts if you rappers tryin ta see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it runnin a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggaz can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the g from brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eatin me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
Till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you lovin the way it's, goin down baby
So ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove
Verse six: ol dirty bastard
Come on
Wu-tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""well God damn what's the recipe? ""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says ""go ask your God damned father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas thing they all that, yo, that shit is g
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of ason, who carries on like a manager
Yo!, sounds fly right? danger!!!

with the sweetest wife ever *smak* I love you honey
I buy her everything, if it takes my last dollar
Even her nails and her hair to be done at the beauty parlor
We spend ample time together, doin dinner and a movie
and whatever else sounds groovy
And when we want real excitement and drama, word to momma
we walk around in our pajamas in the Bahamas
I love her and I need her and I never ever cheat her
I'm far too carin to be considered a woman beater
My style is gentle, romantic and friendly
Nothin like the husband from _Sleeping With the Enemy_
I thought that she was in love with me
I used to think that she couldn't get enough of me
But lately things been seemin strange and..
baby you changed
Somebody's... been sleeping in MY bed..
Somebody's... been sleeping in MY bed..
Now I've heard of traffic but I've never heard of when
you get off at five and don't make it home til ten
Another thing that I can't comprehend:
matchbox and pens from the Holiday Inn
And every night that I had to work late
I come home to see that the bathroom ain't straight
I look at the toilet bowl and wonder whassup
because I know damn well that she don't piss with the seat up
And lookin at the underwear in the room
Now I wear silk drawers; whose Fruit of the Looms?
Another thing that's quite bizarre -
my bathrobe smelled like Brut, but I use Dakar
Now I'm seein that she's treatin me crummy
Also, she must take me for some dummy
Because she'll lay in bed and say, ""Come on in""
but them ain't the same bedsheets from this morning
Now yeah my dear have you been busted
but I still feel like P.E., +Can't Truss It+
You need another lover like you need a hole in your head
and you might get that, you cheesy rat
Cause thinkin about the cost of a divorce
I feel like Johnny Taylor, it's cheaper to keep her
Cheatin on me, what's the reason why?
I hope you die
Somebody's... been sleeping in MY bed..
Somebody's... been sleeping in MY bed..
You done hurt me, broke my heart
and played me for your fool
Now here's my chance to get back at you
and I'm gonna blow my cool
All day long, I'm just singin a
somebody done somebody wrong song
I'm tryin to see how far can this kid go
before our relationship ends up on skid row
Why should I try to stay attached to her
when I'm probably better anywhere as a bachelor
So go 'head girl with that game you're talkin
And since you look like CeCe Peniston, +Keep On Walkin+
Your your your cheatin heart, you're tryin to rip mine apart
Uhh, I wish I'd seen it from the start
Cause now you're caught in what you thought was a fort
Took a short, so I'll see you in court
Somebody's... been sleeping in MY bed..
Somebody's... been sleeping in MY bed..
[Robin Harris]
I hate my wife
I wear my wedding ring on the finger
cause I married the WRONG GOD DAMN woman
[Richard Pryor]
I leave homegirl ?
and come back home, college feet be on

Wetted by a magnum when he didn't have none
That goes to show you that even when you're respected
Brothers'll still try ya if they think you're butt-naked
So i went uptown to get the low-down
To see who made the whole thing go down
Word on the streets had it
Some kids from the Bronx with automatics
Came to start static
Some new jacks at the game
Tryin to get a name
Had a point to prove
Wrong move
So I can't wait to get em all straight
It's a big payback when I retaliate
Steam, I gotta let it off
And I can't wait to set it off
To revenge my main man that's gone
And as sure as my name is Kane, word is bond
The beef is on
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
It's time to show them how to get hard
Callin a hit squad and pull all these clown's ciddard
For tryin to friddont and fiddake the middood
But when I get riddude - awesome dude
So I took a little trip to Brooklyn
Bedstuy Do-Or-Die is where i was lookin
For my boys from Roosevelt, Albany and Marcy
Plus I got a posse over in Canarsie
I'm talkin about ill brothers that don't play
They sit around watchin 'Scarface' all day
So here we go, headed up to they scene
Twenty deep in a van like the A-Team
We rolled up to see what this joint's about
When one of my boys in the van just pointed em out
So without delay we reacted
And started shootin like it was target practice
When they saw that we wasn't messin around
One tried to run, so I had to chase him down
I caught the kid by the corner store deli
Kicked him in the belly like I was Jeff Kelley
I did his jugular vein something violent
Came back to see my crew made the rest silent
We sent fifteen bodies to Trapper John
Cos the beef was on
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef)
(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
(I don't happen to trust people
I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
You'd mop the street up with me
And I got to kill a lot more of your people
To put you in your place)
(You send your boys in I send em back in a paperbag)
Many screamed about a homicide
But when I came to shut em down all the drama died
I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
And we roll like the Corleone family
I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
In the aftermath everything's destroyed
Like a crew of barbarians
And brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians
So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
Cos soon as I see ya, best believe i'ma call your bluff
And everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff
Have fallen and they can't get up
My game is a ill one
Cos i'm a real one
Lorda mercy
Nuff controversy
A gangster, a khan
A pimp and a don
Waitin for the beef to be on

All that, ""Yo baby yo baby,"" it's.. it's-it's-it's not the move
You gotta treat em with respect, never neglect
Try to protect, most of all, project some intellect
Present yourself all proper is important if you truly do want her
So be a gentlemen, and be in her corner
Make her feel like the most
For example -- forget Goodfellas, and take her to see Ghost
Wine and dine under candlelight
Make the mood right tonight while the stars are bright
Then hop in the hot tub and start to rub her on her back
Tssssh, yeah they like that
Satisfaction guaranteed
We gotta give the woman what she need
These days, they don't be fallin for no phony Casanova
since they started watchin Oprah
So even if it's not your style
Open the door for them once in a while
Even buyin them some flowers don't hurt
Yeah it sounds old fashioned.. but it works!
Conversation, good communication
only makes things better in a relation
Cause if you keep watchin the game every week
You might find out your wife's gettin dunked by Dominique
And that can be so upsettin
So try a little Tenderness like Otis Redding
Put the gangster approach on pause
and I dedicate this to you and yours
This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)
Now, what I'm gonna do to keep the flame warm
is sing a better love song than Jeffery Osborne
Serenade a double, what I mean is a couple
that might wanna hug and snuggle and then kiss and say I love you
Cause I think it's best to get a little affectionate
Matter of fact fellas, I would suggest you give
your woman the treatment of a queen and supply her
with some of that Babyface routine, know what I mean?
T-E-N-D-E-R L-O-V-I-N-G C-A-R-E
You figure that out, and keep it in mind
While I bring the chorus back for ya one more time
This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)
(One two three!)
I wanna do somethin freaky to you
Take you to a level that you never been to
Cause no one knows where the nose goes
when the doors close, so take off your pantyhose
I wanna see you moan and groan as I nibble
on your bodily parts as I proceed to jump your bones
And put your feet up here my dear
So I can lick upon your toes until your Revlon dissapear
The passion between will be so incredible
as I prove that a woman is edible
So if you're game for havin a ball
Ladies, I send this out to y'all
This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)
This is for the lover in you
The lover in you, babe, the lover in you (2X)

You know, 1990 begins a new decade
and since I got paid and blew up like a live grenade
It's been a three, four year stretch
And I'd just like to thank all of you
Mmm..
And this goes to everybody in the entire world
That means the United States, overseas in the U.K.
Way in Brazil, Japan, Africa, and everywhere else
I just wanna dedicate this one to you
Here's another groove that I'm bringin to you kind of mellow
And I just want to say hello
or should I say peace as I start to release
The poetry that don't cease is never the least
Your feet got to shuffle as I put the muscle in the groove
cause I'm so smooth
Once you experience a whole Kane rhyme
I'll have you dancin in a Soul Train line
Pick up the pace and get a taste of B-I-G
D-A-double-D-Y Kane in the place
Doin the job how you want it done
with lyrics that's bright as the morning sun
So grab one line, rub it on your face like sunshine
and everything else'll combine
This is that particular beat
for all the fellows feelin mellow to pump in the Jeep
Uhh, also for every girlie
to shamiyo, shamago like Laverne and Shirley
Huh, now wait, now wait, now wait a minute
Uhh!  Now check this
I wanna talk about peace and unity and love
Not one, but all of the above
Comin together like keys on a piano
Black and white to unite and oh man oh man
what joy did we, find
Hard for me to say it sometimes

I'm talking bout nothing but pure D badness
My acceleration is compatible to a bima
My pockets looking greener, from the funky cold medina
Don't tell me bout the things that you done did cause I done did it
Don't tell me bout the skins that you done hit, cause I done hit it
And once I rock these, with a style that's cock deis
Good God, I get the crowd together like knock knees
Now, I don't act hard, I just mack hard
Baggin' video looking honeys with the big back yard
Yes lord, girls I'm gamin' leaving the microphone flamin'
Throwing up hip-hop signs cause that's the set that I be claimin'
Guerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card
Grimies from Fort Green  to Malcolm X Boulevard
Now, if that's what you're hoping then it's the wrong things you're scopin'
I may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid I'll get you open
Verse 2
Here comes a taste of the rawness, like you never saw this
Once I grip the cordless, my victory is flawless
Chaos and havoc, lyrically psychopathic
At times get pornographic, lord man I gots to have it
Then I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate
Too legit splendid come get wit' it for your comfort
But then sloppily, rappers try to copy me
Take pieces of my property, and use it all unproperly
And probably, been focusing a while to copy my style
But child what I'll compile is too versatile
I'm too superior, it's sort of like comparing a
Spanking new Desert Eagle to a rusty little derringer
But skip the tool, let's try to deal here with the jewel
That I'm droppin on you, now let me take you all to school
You see, to graduate in hip-hop you must be smart
And no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art
Poetry and literature is what makes this English fanatic
Now dig this, I drop science but still deal with mathematics
And since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery
I learned the dead presidents to pass American History
Got my degree in rapology
Hip-hop had to set me free, look mom, a real emcee
So you want yours now, well don't get caught with your drawers down
Cause word life, this industry is half corrupt just like the Dogg  Pound
Verse 3
Rap godfather
Oh goodness gracious, you better make it spacious
For the vivacious, ostentatious, who feel courageous?
I put it on them using my tongue as a sword
But at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
Whatever it takes to see your nerve gone, and word born
Black Caesar gonna get his swerve on
My name should be referred to in medical terms
Cause I get way up in the cut and I'm talking way worse than germs
You like to chase it playin catch like Tom & Jerry
But on the contrary, I'd rather sip the Dom Peri
Lay back in harmony, because it's so bizarre to see
That all the hard core rappers are slowly turning R&B
Well pardon me, you contradict yo'self, I see you not perfect yo'self
You like that type music yo'self, stick yo'self
What happened to black men of pride æ??uff men have died
Nowadays what's been applied, in hip-hop is genocide
That's when the rappers go get the clappers
Can't you see they trying to strap us just to trap us, good god it's backwards
One nation under a groove, that's how we move
It's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove
Me no run with the gun or speak of none for action
When you get done scream I'm the one, it looks like an illusion
I deal with equality so never call my brethren son
Yes mon, me got mad flava just like jerk chicken

(Once again it's on)
(You got beef you better save it for the muthafuckin meat market)
(I don't happen to trust people
I sort of figured if you thought I was weak
You'd mop the street up with me
And I got to kill a lot more of your people
To put you in your place)
(You send your boys in I send em back in a paperbag)
Many screamed about a homicide
But when I came to shut em down all the drama died
I plead insanity when I got a jam with me
And we roll like the Corleone family
I bring the boys that'll bring the noise
In the aftermath everything's destroyed
Like a crew of barbarians
And brothers that want beef, I make em vegetarians
So don't even front and try to put it as if you're ruff
Cos soon as I see ya, best believe i'ma call your bluff
And everyone else that tried to press up on me tuff
Have fallen and they can't get up
My game is a ill one
Cos i'm a real one
Lorda mercy
Nuff controversy
A gangster, a khan
A pimp and a don
Waitin for the beef to be on

But one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac
You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine
Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed
The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it so please don't spoil it
Yeah it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it, ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you
A dramatic fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserve the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine

Uhh
Like this
It's strictly business baby
Uhh Mr. Cee, now, y'all feel me
The name is Big Daddy you know as in your father
You read the book of Mack and now it's time to meet the author
Ain't no fallin' on precise the mic
Get the bite words to follow like dice berg and babble
I follow the rules of engagement
That I learned from the school in the basement
When I move on the pavement
Cats don't understand what they facin'
Stay patient, I date ya game like Playstation
You still sorry, represent ya skills poorly
Vigorous pain that you about to feel shortly
Cats I kill softly, gets bless, spills of me
Get more bucks than Milwaukee keep it real for me
I know the vision and the spot in the light
Took a swing at the God, and all you got was a strike
All you haters in the game you get blocked of the light
But you couldn't see the Kane with a binocular mic
Who want it
""Hip-hop icon keep a grip just like a python""
""The name Kane, is superior to anyone""
""Hip-hop icon keep a grip just like a python""
""It means Kane Aziatic Nobody's Equal""

The rapgame plex sees a Mary got regular
That's what I take it to, fuck you gon' make it a
Dark skin smooth talkin' hog bitch cruise talkin'
All starts in New York
And my figures I spread apart, check yo game
Cause nigga, my repetoire just don't change
Pimps up, hoes down, breasts up clothes down
Shock with the hustle, when stuff goes down
I'm still peppin', nothing but the ill women
I smash the bust of on they crest like Bill Clinton
You checkin out the claws and I know I'm real temple
But I got the right force to make 'em all feel different
Y'all smokin mad buddha the ak knew that the fast shooter
With the attitude of a sad cuba
Now you wanna pass through the life of somebody, please call ""9-1-1""
But it won't be for Wyclef you heard!?

Pullin ya I don't know who the fuck you tryin to hang with
We don't even speak to say kinda language
My chore is declined cause you crossed the line, steppin
Way out your league, must have lost your mind
You're goin home with the same girl that gettin bed
I slide with instead every night a different head
Get her hot with the spot like it forbid
And get more brain than Zombies in the Living Dead
Make sure profit's more brokes I gets de-sated
Grass my nigga will believe we're still close
Of real most, of your lames just cunnings
That's what you call spittin?
Than shit I'ma vomit
Huh, lyrical veteran best to come into sever
Whenever they come to crumble and measure andt I'm ahead of them
Listen child lock your fists and cow

[Big Daddy Kane]
It's hard enough for a black man tryin to make it today
Strugglin to find the right way
So I say, times is hard, word to God
Recessions, depressions, the whole nine yards
That itself makes a brother wanna break
But bein an entertainer puts the icin on the cake
Cause I can remember when I looked up to Kurtis Blow
and said that's where I gotta go
So here I am, paid in the rap trade
But still gettin played, for my darker shade
That's not the only P-R-O-B-L-E-M
Man, that's just the beginnin of them
For example, I can't walk the streets alone..
.. without bein known
Don't get me wrong, cause deep in my heart I do love it
But I can't even dig up my nose in public, huh
MC Rell couldn't have said it no plainer
Yeah, that's the life of an entertainer
And the times are so hard to understand
that it makes me a troubled man
* Mister Cee cuts up Chuck D saying ""I got so much trouble on my mind"" *
[Big Daddy Kane]
I like women, but I hate womankind
Love can be just too much for the mind
Cause I've toured the world from state to state
and wouldn't lay down tonight without havin a mate
Married girls in tight miniskirts
that left they husband waitin at the concert
I don't discriminate with girls that I talk to
I take em Mello-Yello to Chocolate Yoo-hoo
But now I couldn't find the right girl to fit me
Not even if she walked into my face and bit me
You see it's hard to make a woman your wife
when you've been humpin married woman the most of your life
You better believe that's true, word up
cause if it happened to me, then it can happen to you
I'm not tryin to say that a woman is scandalous
I'm just showin you who the troubled man is
* Mister Cee cuts up Chuck D saying ""I got so much trouble on my mind"" *
[Big Daddy Kane]
Brothers from the past..
.. in the streets of Bed-Stuy or my ?Sara J? class
Some of them are cool, some of them at times can be a bother
Thinkin I got jobs to give like Roy Rogers
I try to explain I'm not on tour yet
And they say, ""You think you're all that? Yeah, I bet!""
So when I see em on the solo tip
I gotta throw joints to prove my point
Just when I thought that I had the neighborhood support
here comes another battle to be fought, huh
You know they even tried to start a AIDS rumor
Diggin the kind of life, that would maybe doom a
brother of my priniciple, you'd think some of these people
would be more sensisble, because a lie like that
didn't bring my sex flow to an end
Maaaaaaaan, I'm still gettin skins!
And the beat goes on until the thrill is gone
And life is the same old song
And maybe one day you can understand
What it's like to be a troubled man

Like you put your armpits in a drum machine
Good God
Break me off some of that
Come on
Easy Mo, just let the beat rock from your sweet stock
To bounce the complete block, make everyone on the street flock
To this here rhymthm, music'll hit em, get em, my lyrics'll fit em
When I get with em, girls I'm in em, smokin like bags of ism
The one that keep amazin y'all, don't even know who you're facin, pa
The Kane has flipped more tracks than a racing car
The one who created it and many others imitated it
I heard your rap style, kid - hated it
Let me show you how, look here, now check my style
What I spit out, it'll raise your brow, make you say wow
Ba-da-bow-bow, come on, now let's get down
And sway, sway when you hear the music play
Hip-hop hooray, this is what I want you to say
Hey
I'm in love with Big Daddy Kane
He makes the party swing
He turns the mother out
And rips apart things
Then I go...
Da-da-da-da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin down
Da-da-da-da-da
You know I like the way it sound
And I just love the way it's goin down
Now, what's this b.s. you're sayin?
And don't try to act like Martin now with all that 'i was just playin'
No need to grief or mourn cause now the beef is on
Boom-bow-boo-bow-bow - kid, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap that don't mean that you catchin wreck with me
You step to this, I give you mic-o-vasectomy
I only know one person that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle
Cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle? I gots to have it
Unless you're gonna rob me like they give Riddick a win for Chavez
Cause tryin to go against the Kane rappin
Is like a pimp tryina pull a nun - ain't nothin happenin
Clear the way for the one, champion, true black don
Gun gettin the job done take a look, hon
Back up, son, you know you can't get none
Come on, I'm on a whole other level of rap
And it's like that, now show me where the party at
Da-da-da-da-da
Yeah, I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin down
Da-da-da-da-da
You know I like the way it sound
And I love the way it's goin down
The B-I-G D-A-D-Y, no, back up and add another D
Come back to the K to the A to the N to the E
Live from New York, the one and only
I give it to you raw for my homies
And to the ladies: I take em lookin somethin fine
It don't mind if we bump 'n grind
If you're with me, jump in line
Because if in my wallet I can find one prophylactic
Then you better believe, girl, that you're gonna get your ass dicked
Hard type of rappers extinct like a dinosaur
The kind you saw rhyme before
But now you never find no more
Steppin to the Kane with some drama to be startin
Because I put em all on ice like Tonya Harding
Back up, boy, I got the whole convoy
Rollin with me on a mission that's to seek and destroy
So, to all the people that's been tryin to talk about me
You better change your name to 5000 cause you're Audi
And if you bring on your crew, I'm steppin to them too
Just put the beat on and watch how I swing through
The groove, with more style than a backstroke
Drivin past my competition like cab drivers do black folks
That's the way I move, I always stayed a Smooth
Operator with data watin for you to play a groove
To turn it out without a doubt and show what I'm about
Good lookin, Brooklyn, yeah, we in the house

I take the cake but you can't get a crumb
from the poetic, authentic, superior
Ultimate - and all that good shit
I'm the original, Asiatic, acrobatic
There you have it, now get dramatic
Creatin drama when I'm on the scene
And I pack em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just CRUMBLE
And I'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
your Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey
Starsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
that's for you not to come near, PERIOD
So I ain't buggin or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a Fisher Price MC
that thought he was nice into Minute Rice
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff
Cause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic I ravage, not like a savage
but in my own way of doin damage
As I design the genuine line
Now who flattop rules in eighty-nine?
Warm it up, Kane (16X)
..
Take two other men with soul that you probably know
Deadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby show
Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush
They step to me, but can't stop the bumrush
I make material, rich and imperial
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Same old same old, but Poppa's Got a Brand New Bag
So put the mic down boy, you can't work it
Due to wack lyrics, it's bout to short circuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss, no remorse
You lost, with force, of course, a holocaust
First I caught ya, then put ya through torture
You moved wrong my son, so I taught ya
Just like a guardian, that put your body in
the mood to groove with the smoove way that I'm partyin
Competition may find it spectacular
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula
and waste the taste, cause ain't no sugar here
So come near if you dare, you BOOGA BEAR
You start hallucinatin like Magic
The wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it
Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin
Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin
So pick a VC date, cause you're history
Here comes Kane Scoob Scrap Jay and Mister Cee
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
I'm the man you can't hold back
and all competition appears to be weak
I meant to say wack, a vision of blur
Just them thinkin I'm competitin, I say, ""Huh!""
Warm it up, Kane (16X)
..
Genuine for eighty-nine, you know what I'm sayin?
As I give a shout out to my man Tony A
Tony P, Sally Sal and the whole Libra Digital posse
Can't forget my man Yawnski
and Smooth the Barber, you know what I'm sayin?
Also, I gotta say whassup to Born True, B-Boy,
and my man big Jay Cee
The whole rest of the crew, Scoob Lover my brother
Scrap Lover, and DJ Mister Cee
Can't forget Supreme, Abu, MelQuan and Shabazz
Wally D, and the rest of the brothers
and of course my little brother the Little Daddy Shane
Manditory end of the story, you know what I'm sayin?

Here comes dark gable raps remarkable
Mic ripper, cash flipper, cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere that's french for ass whipper
Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was rosa parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the kane story
Chorus
Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky
Verse 2
Fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin? out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't erykah badu
Black caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on priest pai mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up

But the thing that just ain't clickin?

You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the messiah take you higher as I supply ya? what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin? em black
Closest thing to me would be; nothin? in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than lauryn hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin? through them like a finish line

Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
Mic ripper, cash flipper, Cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere that's French for ass whipper
Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If  I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a SAT
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story

Verse 2
Fuck the chorus
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu
Black Caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how Jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex

Kick a rhyme spectacular, I think the Nigga think he Blackula
I seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight
Somehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite
Go for the jugular vein, that's my new thing
How did you do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-tang
Your luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain
Well good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane.
I creep on MC's like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine
to dig in you rappers like a coalmine
Now look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me
Ooh it's starting to get ugly
Don't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist
As I tongue the microphone down just like a French kiss.
Relentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to
Put it on you like voodoo
Chorus
Unda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat
Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak
Ay yo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time
They can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes

When you diggin' out your girl from behind, you're gonna find
The reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind
Your royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes
Even Cabesa de pollos that habla Espaé§?l
Dig this now, run for your life to get away but none do
Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to
Test the, stupendous, tell me what was you to gain
Internal bleeding, due to Kane
Boom bow bow, ooh, the pain
Nobody's equal, keep it lethal, and diesel, to see to the people
And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do
The pain gets inflicted, fake MC's get evicted
Face it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with
Since days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the Feds
Rip your whole set to shreds
A crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect
Only thing I want to know now, is this cash or a check?
Chorus
Verse 3
Ain't no question,
I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion
Not the one for testing,
come mess with and end up with your chest split
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act.
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds in the state of paranoia
I said if you're scared, get a dog
So by tomorrow you'll probably see 20 rappers walking with Rotweilers
Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent
You won't win with it so limit it
before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burning me
You found yourself bleeding internally

You're the kinda girl I wanna get closer to
Become the most to you like love is supposed to do

Cause it's time to organize and open your eyes
Realize, we on the rise
to the climax, time to take charge
Whoever said we can't live large?
To seek out fortune without distortion
and stop livin for just a small portion
There is a move to make, we gotta take a chance to break
all chains become awake
Cause this is the new way, to be proud and brave
and I ain't goin out like a slave
In eighty-nine, I'm livin like a champ

Let's start to do for ourself
We can't depend on no one else or the board of health
So hold your own or else you're gonna find
that if you play off of crime you go out like Aunt Jemimah
We gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
to stay alive, that's the reason I've
came to, motivate us to the length
Effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
Takin no mediums or small at all
We gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall

are now in effect, and we can't take shorts, because

Swing on that right there, pump it up, here we go
Uh-huh, uh-huh, pump it up, here we go

Let's unite together, we can't sever never
no matter what or what-ever
Because we need unity to find justice
Just I See Equality so bust this
Take a stand and command to demand what's grand
I know we can if we just understand
the true way of livin that was really meant for us
So one more time, kick the chorus!

[Big Daddy Kane]
A black man from the motherland
Speakin a language today most people don't understand
where no one could bother me
cause I had freedom, justice, and equality
But then one day it was tooken away
and I was shipped to the U.S.A.
A young brother, made into a slave
to harvest the midlands and clean the chittlins
Given a new name, new religion
No freedom to vote, not even to make a decision
I saw my peoples, sold raped and took out
The rest of that stuff that Alex Haley talks about
They said I'm not from Asia I'm from Africa
And all the blacks there now are just scavengers
That's the way my mind was poisoned
to believe that in America blacks are inferior
A weak mind and a body of swine
only adds up to being - deaf dumb and blind
Illiterate to who where what and why
So I ask myself: who am I?
""I was born..""
[Big Daddy Kane]
A native New Yorker on the streets
Known for rockin rhymes to real rough beats
that I found in the attic, noisy with static
A sound that made me, a hip-hop fanatic
I made a few songs that sold OK
Never top 20 or plenty airplay
I came out hardcore, flexin cock diesel
Saw a little cash, and pop goes the weasel
I had to make that change and rearrange
my whole rap format, no hardcore rap
So now all the pop charts I rule
over New Kids on the Block and Paula Abdul, huh
I thought I made it, then my song faded
and none of the black stations ever have played it
I tried to blame it on MTV
and say, ""Damn, they cold played me for Young MC""
But when you get down to it, I'm the real blame
because I wanted the fame
Money is not only the root of all evil
It's also the destruction of black people, so
conjunction junction, what's your function?
Bein a scout, or sellin out?
Look in the mirror at yourself, eye to eye
and say: who am I?
[Gamilah Shabazz]
A solid change, have to rearrange this strange
feelin I'm feelin, so appealin
I am having to deal with
Time to forget the myth, of bein black and a woman
Can't get ahead, walkin on a thread, a tightrope
Can't cope, don't be a dope, have a little bit of hope
Runnin your scope on affairs
You have to be aware, don't flare up
Let your cup runneth over
I'm not Irish, don't need a donut to fill up my dish
nor two mango wish to wish on a star, they're so far
Anyway I'm thinkin about today, not tomorrow
I'm not a follower of anyone
My time has come, it's already here
My message is clear
Like the women of long ago, I am also here
also to show, I have the courage
Have the strength, I'm for equal opportunity
no matter the life, length of time
Show me a sign, should I rely on a
subliminal message, should I question
what would seem to be, life's told me?
Yes indeed, so let me speak
[Big Daddy Kane]
And that's comin from the daughter of Malcolm X
So black women put it in your texts
so you can never let, opportunity pass you by
or even ask yourself, who am I?

Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I?
Proud to be a Black man
Coming exact and
Giving up to brothers five on the back hand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers
I say the mother, as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so letæ?¯ bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising
We be sizing
Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest

But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane

Crossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out

I'm a rebel, BLESSED, able to hold a

Treat a rapper like a wrestler, and body slam him

I know this chick  yo mami is rich  she push a six
Living some bloodshed  her man is pushing bricks
Crib way out in the sticks  they house looking slick
It's like some shit straight out of a Hollywood flick
Me and my clique met the chick up at Saint Nicks
Honey was thick  I was the first nigga to kick
Yo mami was thick  silk skirt with thigh split
I couldn't quit  trying to peep out the privates
The live shit, you know how loose I get
I'm scheming on her back, peeping her hips, fiending to hit
Plump cherry lips, medium tits, Chink eyes her baby hair chick
The type you want to pair with, have an affair with
? flip me the digits, to the hip and the phone flip
Said she had to split, hopped in the whip, headed up the strip
Probably had to get with her man and shit
Later on at night, I'm stressing love at first sight
Some ain't right, I ain't the type of cat like me
to be dealing with mad feelings
And even though mami was mad appealing
Body revealing and big wheeling
This shit is illin, I don't like it
Fuck it, I can't fight it
I reaching for the cordless to call Miss
I insist to get with this
Tan Tone answer the phone, ""Hello, who this?"" (chick)
""It's me baby, G Luciano, what up lady""
""Fine and how you doing boo"" (chick)
""Ain't nothing new but you, angel, yo why don't you swing through
""we could sip on some champagne from Spain boo""
About an hour or two she came thru, fly hairdo
We link, push in the six circle circle drink
To purple mink, had mad bank, Chanel bag full of Benjamin Franks
More ices than a hockey rink, face of a Saint
Went for a drink ? Hot shots
Would wanna spend those five digit o's, on bimbo's
Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove
My eyes closed her nigga dozed, when I awoke
Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos
Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove
She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe
Panty hoes with see thru holes, pretty toes
Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet
Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets
As I was speaking to this half black/latin freak
Met on a Manhatten street, body petite, fat on the cheeks
I was getting open, started laughing and joking
We weed smoking, stroking, the shorty's spoke and
Said what the deal is, the realness
My man is crazy as Bruce Willis
If he catches us, he'll try to kill us
He got a whole army of Kiiers
Me no worry, I got the clapper son
End of the first verse, chapter one
Word
Shit is real in the field
Thug love story
[G. Luciano]
So here I am
Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos
With this chick I don't even really know
Steady stressing me how ill her man is
So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway
Straight twisting mami's back out
Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep
Clothes still on, breath smelling like Henrock
Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man
I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures
[Kool G. Rap]
The next day about a quarter to eight
I heard a squeek on the staircase
Got the gat from under the pillow case
Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken
Good thing I slept inside my clothes and shorty was frozen
I'm waiting for a head to poke in, and start smoking
The home invasion, right through the door, he started blazing
Bullets was grazing, shit was crazy and
I had to think to fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash
Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass
Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee
With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony
Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth
Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it
We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled
Mad soldiers out in the field, busting they steel
The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real
Ten hit me right on my heels, trying to make a thugs blood spill
In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees
Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these
Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped
The other six started to pop, I feel something hot
I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped
Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick
She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips
I started clapping, niggas rolled up in blowing black and
Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our as in
Mash the gas, make the fucking wheel spin
The safety again, and still doing a hundred and ten
Shorty shivering, lips quivering, ski suits up in the back seat
Pulled over the Jeep get it in
And took a rest stop at the river bend
We living, we made it the fuck out, mad slugs delivering
Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom
Got shorty boo tending my bullet wound
Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon
Up in the moonlit room, and dicking her womb
Hitting full behind her, grinding her with my anaconda
She rode the dick like a honda
I took her to the point of no return like Bridgette Fonda
She back spasmed, giving the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm
My dick glistened, her lips hit'em, I shot jism
Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism
I thought about the realism
Niggas coming and bring they steel with them
I got just the thing to deal with them
Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed
Push a niggas whole head back, so I snatched that
So quick spread out and play the layout
Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out
[G. Luciano]
Yo what's the matter mami, you scared or something?
[Mami]
I'm a little worried baby
[G. Luciano]
Yo, don't be worried about nothing, alright
Everything is gonna be alright
[Mami]
OK
[G. Luciano]
Look, we just gonna go to your house, go get the money
You know, we gonna get your backs or whatever
And we gonna get out of there, alright?
[Mami]
Alright, ven paca papi, dame un besito
[G. Luciano]
Alright, grab that bag money
[Mami]
Let's do this, baby
[Kool G. Rap]
After three whole days of lamping, we broke camp and
Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons
Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random
Five hundred grand is buried in the sand
We planning, up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm counting the dough
She packing her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls
I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those
Shit was sitting on some chrome momo's
Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O
Told the chick, yo you moving to slow
Speed it up baby, we got to go
And get this plane and hit the Caymans
With the payment, somebody came in
A platoon of goons with heaters aiming
I drew the Mac 10 and started flaming, they did the same and
Slugs spraying and blood raining, I left about seven thugs laying
But this one cat was gaining, he grab the dame and
Put the heater to the chicks brain and
I let my two guns drop, they got the drop
They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht
The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot
Nigga was hot, took the glock and hit me dead in my knot
Honey started to panic and yelling that money in spanish
Thinking he's out to take advantage
So we're out in the fucking Atlantic
With no lifesavers and stranded
Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore
Said, ""amor you won't be pretty no more""
Took us on a tour, down in the deck
Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet
Saw this nigga there, holding the Tec
Ready to wet, I'm started to sweat, a niggas stressed
We up beside a horrible mess
I saw a box with the letters on it S.O.S
So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest
Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless
The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest
Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left
Threw his ass over board and told him hold your breath
Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck
Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast
Held her in my arms till her soul finally left
I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death
A real thug lost the only women he loved
And I bugged, busting slugs at the stars above

Since I made the record ""Talk Like Sex ""
bitches are comin' up with their friends for a nigga to hit the skins.
Hopin' the Kool G Rap was just makin' rhymes
but I'm leavin' bitches' vaginas with more stitches than Frankenstein.
Some even had the nerve to try to give me head
and swallow the whole jimmy to make a nigga fed.
But come on you bitches, don't make me laugh;
you couldn't deep throat G Rap if you was a motherfuckin' giraffe.
Dag, some even fled when they saw the head,
cuz G's dick would make you seasick fuckin' me in a waterbed.
Don't try to paly me like no sucker,
cuz these bitches'll be callin' up Dial-a-Mattress like a motherfucker.
You heard the song before; you don't wanna see me,
""I'll fuck you on the A-train while I write graffiti.""
I'll even fuck you in a taxi cab,
and after sex with a nigga you'll be buyin' a box of maxi-pads.
Soon as you open your legs,
no need for no birth control, bitch, cuz my dick is touchin' the eggs.
Kool G Rap, the pussy slammer;
hell, I'd be talkin' fucked up grammar if you was Bad Mamma Jamma.
I ain't small, I'll have you cummin' like waterfalls,
and then turn them sugar walls into Carnegie Hall.
Leavin' my mark on bitches like Zorro,
plus fuckin' bitches so def like there won't be no pussy left tomorrow.
Hittin' hoes like it ain't funny,
I think about bowls of Cheerios because I want my nuts and honey.
Talkin' to all the women that look fine,
pretendin' my prick was Moby Dick and have a whale of a time.
Now I'm not a deep-sea diver,
but I love it when my dick's covered and smothered with saliva.
Shit, might even straighten out your dentures,
because it's not just a blow job, honey, it's an adventure.
But 69, and I ain't with that:
I'll go to a Chinese restaurant, bitch, if I wanna eat cats.
Because you gotta be brave to eat the tuna, G.
So when it comes to pussy-lickin', I'm the chicken of the sea.
I should be on the sex channel;
not a chump cuz I'm givin' punk-bitches better humps than camels.
If you're a virgin, I'll make it fit,
because my dick'll pop the cherry and spit out the fuckin' pit.
And if you're concerned, my sperm don't burn,
and if it did, I'd give that nappy-headed ass a fuckin' perm.
Shucks, I instruct a fuckin' lesson.
You think it's painless? I hit the anus and fuck up your large intestines.
Leavin' you bitches stingin' from the bangin';
my man Jimmy got a hole in his head, but yo, that nigga's still hangin'.
Bitch, you'd rather hump a fuckin' whole army,
cuz even the Witness Protection Program couldn't hide this man's salami.
You fuck around and catch a seizure,
before I fuck a hoe I gots ta put the hooker under anesthesia.
Lettin' saliva dribble on your nipple,
orgasms double and triple sit ripple and turn your ass into a gripple.
Then I see you searchin' for the swellin',
cuz I'm-a leave a hole so big your gynecologist might fall the hell in.
Got damn! I hit the ham right;
honeybuns, you can ask my Three Sons, I got the Dick right out the Van Dyke.
I'm fuckin' naked girls with fly rhymes,
but don't push me, because that pussy will be runnin' for it's nine lives.
I know you hookers can't refuse this,
but dont' pick me to give no hickeys cuz I'm givin' bitches bruises.
Yeah, I'll tear that pussy hole apart,
for fuckin' with G Rap after dark, you'd rather jog in Central Park.
So if you want kids before I fuck ya,
look at the size of my dick, and you'll let out the motherfuckers.
Shit, bitches get open like a can;
just leave it up to G Rap, cuz I'm the neighborhood Fuck U Man...

Behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back on the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat...
[unknown singer]
She's dressed to kill
Iced-out head to toe, a snake in black
She's cleared, to, get ill
She's about the dough, the black widow
[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Yo, she was a tight bird, female version of Iceberg
To put in the right words
Played the right curves, beige and white birds
The type she served it was quite superb
Ran through the city in a white suburb
Lived in a predominantly white suburb
She liked the herb, rockin all the richest type of furs
Make your life submerge if you strike a nerve
Dough she like to splurge
Shine of her light blurs from off her finger
Honey was off the ringer, the way she tossed the flamer
'94 walked into danger, behind the wall fought with a banger
Trapped in the beast, gas released, a rat deceased
Back to the street, back on her feet
Clappin the heat, from the back seat, in back of a jeep
Stackin the heat, pilin the ones
Made her point when violence was brung
Regulated and balanced the slums
Brought in a cat with a talent for guns
Click quick to silence a Dunn
Convoys of black limos
Employs strapped with mack millos
Bustin off caps through a cracked window, that's the MO
Push your wig back, make you a black Leno
The feds on her tracks got the phones tapped for info
Tryin to map the dividend flow, and where the ends go
Checkin on whose name the Benz go
Who pushes the buttons when Mac-10's blow
A rose on a black satin pillow
The silhouette of her web, killin for bloodspill, a black widow
[Chorus: unknown singer] + (Kool G Rap)
She's (out for blood) dressed (for the kill) to kill (bustin slugs)
Iced-out (shit is real) head (livin crime) to toe (life of crime)
A snake (droppin heads) in black (pullin nines)
She's cleared (dodgin heat) to (play the street)
Get ill (let the guns blow, had to eat)
She's about (copped the raw) the dough (went to war)
The black widow (beef no more, cold fours at your door)
[Verse 2: Kool G Rap]
She was married but four times a widow
The fifth time ditto, kiddo
Step out of line, kitko, she spit nines and shi-dells
Put a pound to the tip of your niddose
Put em in line piddles
Diamond-stud shinin the clito', the web spinnin
With bloodstains soaked in the bed linen
Spread venom, known for bustin the lead grinnin, tilted red brimmin
Makin the lights inside of your head dimmin
Givin head to men and, leave a knife in they chest with a red ribbon
Bread to swim in, foes get left deader than Lennon
Threads of linen, sippin gin with a shread of lemon
Dead-up thoroughbred, slim and trim and stackin cake like Emminger's
Under the down coat brown coat like cinnamon
She went to have the Benjamins, for that she injure men
Send a squad to go and injure men that injure men
On top of that she popular, hit the opera
Francis Ford Coppola, mezzanine she's with binoculars
You even think about poppin her, stoppin her, moppin her, droppin her
Hard with bodyguards divin on top of her
Cops in they Blu-Blockers watchin her, steady clockin her
Jock her, dreamin of knockin her, thinkin a scheme for knockin her
Dress provocative, show the cleavage between her knockers
Bust a sock off with a blocker to rasta inside her locker
She cover the bills though, restaurant delicatessen Armadillo
White Willow, strike of the black widow
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Kool G Rap]
She held a white weddin
Type settin just like a sight from heaven
Spend twice the bread'n from her last rice on her head'n
All types of presents, striking presence
Bodyguards ready to light they weapons, ignite the Wessons
Refuse to live the life of a peasant
Days and nights was right and type pleasant
At the foot of the aisles, took vows
with all the criminals and crook pals
That put smiles on niggaz' necks while they look foul
Piles of cops peepin her central book files
Beef them niggaz cook wild, groom lookin shook style
Forced into marriage, horse and a carriage
Remember lifespan shorter than average, lady boss flossin her carats
Dreams to get rich and perish in Paris
Cherish the cabbagem, makin her path out of the church passage
Thugs they do they dirt massive
Skirt slashed, first class, Doni Amberg glasses
Flirt with her lashes
Snapshots, smirk for the flashes
Plots to leave her murked in the masses
Two killin experts on the grasses
Put in they Tec work for the cashes
Leave the Earth hurt with a passion
Two louds shots burstin in action
Made her head jerk from the blastin
Lady down, holdin her shirt gaspin, hit by another turf assassin
Reason not even worth askin; the facts are real, though
Got her cap peeled for stackin real dough
Lifestyle brillo when you're rollin for krill dough
Death of a black widow

[Kool G Rap]
This one goes out to my Queens thugs, that steam slugs
My real killers out on the corner that's seen blood
My wild niggaz schemin with snubs, fiendin for grub
Eatin off the streets, triple-beamin the drugs
The ones that put a red beam in your mug
The ones that bug and be in the clubs
and hide whips, gleamin with dubs
This one goes out to my peoples
that hit the hot blocks to cop the diesel
in back of the spots but chop on the lethal
Then pop goes the weasel
If niggaz want it, then pop goes the eagles
We can draw guns and rock like The Beatles
Drop pots of evil, ghetto D with shots from a needle
Lay you down with shots that are cerebral
Before rap, my click was hot as Segal, now we clock legal
Hop like Kenieval, pass the cops in our Regals
Above blowin like diplomats, me and my click of cats
Duck when we spit the gat or get your shit twisted back
[Chorus]
[Jinx Da Juvy]
That young fella straight from the slums and that's that
Got kicked out of school cause I used to carry guns in my knapsack
Been a serious dude, never the one to laugh at
So play crazy and this 380'll twist your cap back
Before rap, I played the slums where the cash at
Duckin the boys in blue, with jumps in asscrack
Now I switched over, but still tote the big toaster
for niggaz schemin so I'm fiendin to bend your wig over
You might catch the kid herbed out, bent over
Without a license, gettin brain in a tint Rover
But not for nuttin, a frontin dude get popped for frontin
Y'all the type to snitch when a cop's comin
But that don't stop nuttin cause trust me the cop's duckin
A badge don't mean shit, when the glocks is gunnin
And I don't think the pig's tryin to get, popped in the stomach
Or be worse, layin with they wig hotter than the oven
[Chorus]
[Kool G Rap]
G Rap as real as it gets, peel with the fifth
Bust down a mill' with the click, ill with the chicks
Wheelin the 6 to cribs on hills in the sticks
Metal we pack is heavy you can feel when it spit
Used ta, reel in the chips, slangin krills on the strip
Now we, spillin the Crist', niggaz still with the hits
Won't stop until I cop a half-a-mill' for the wrist
Rule with a iron fist but still in the midst
G Rap and his squad of guerillas, carve your grill up
Harsh killer hold the hammer like 20 bar villains
Spit flames like Godzilla, menage-a-trois in large villas
Pack the trey-pound God pealer
It's a hard thriller mob chiller
Decide your fate like a Tarot card dealer
Y'all niggaz is yard squealers; play around and be a scar feeler
A shot down man on the tar feeler chick witchu the gem star spiller

A nigga livin foul (repeat 2X)
As I steps inside the playground
I lays down my laws at the door
and any nigga that's lookin for trouble
gotsta face these silver double four's
that I be packin on my hip  hollow tips inside the clip
Ready to rip a niggaz shit and make his wig slip
to the side as a homocide's commited
I gets rid of niggaz quick cause ain't no bullshit permitted
I'm a outlaw, the motherfuckin villain doin killings, I won't stop
until the morgue got bodies stacked up to the fuckin ceiling
And ain't no drivebys, a mag and a bag lady, disguised and surprise
you got a hole between your fuckin eyes
Niggaz is grazed, catchin strays from the blaze
Amazed by the ways I lays em down when my shit sprays
Crazy brains hangin, and niggaz veins are swingin
Bangin and gunslingin, even my own fuckin ears are ringin
cause what I carry's much bigger than Dirty Harry's
Do a Hail Mary, I make Bloody Mary's out of your capillaries
Pieces of flesh, hangin off a niggaz chest, cause the vest
that he dress, couldn't FUCK with the Smith and Wess'
Motherfuckers runnin for miles, bodies stacked up in piles
I'm killin executioner style
Comin straight off the sidewalks of New York
A nigga livin foul -- ""I kill em executioner style"" -> G. Rap
(repeat 2X)
I keeps my forty-five loaded with dum-dums, in rear I hold this
right at my waist for just in case somebody gots to get exploded
Cause G. Rap ain't that nigga that try to play so nigga lay low
or get yourself a pair of wings, a harp, and a halo
Clown, keep fuckin around, and you'll be dead G
I'm spttin out the lead see, to split your fuckin head like the Red Sea
Charged up with anger, six slugs in every chamber
Dangerous stranger, with itchy trigger fingers like Lone Ranger
I'm comin to split your cabbage like a savage
and put two in yo' ass bitch
and one inside the wifey and the baby carriage
So head for the hills, I kills niggaz for thrills
Causin crazy blood spill, when I let one drill in your grill
I will pull out the glock to clear the blocky when I cock it
Get laid and played out of pocket with a rocket in your eye socket
So raise up queers, and say your fuckin prayers
I've been killin for years, huntin motherfuckers like reindeers
If one nigga's left standin, I'll squeeze the cannon (BOOM)
Opened his motherfuckin ass like the Grand Canyon
Layin faggot niggaz like towel when I gets wild and fouol
I'm killin executioner style
Comin straight off the sidewalks of New York
A nigga livin foul -- ""I kill em executioner style"" -> G. Rap
(repeat 2X)
..
I take ten paces, draw my shit, and aim at niggaz faces
Leavin no traces so a nigga's BEATIN body cases
I'm wettin shit up, you get hit up, by the super soaker
Brain after brain, I'm a motherfuckin chain smoker
Cause it's the rootin tootin with the six-shooter
Put a hole in your trooper so big niggaz can hula hoop ya
Liftin them Smith and Wessuns like the westerns
I blow out a niggaz intestines, and send him back to the fuckin essence
Bullet rows, blows out the nose of my fo'-fo'
Gunnin down all you bozos who run and call for po-po
Send in paramedics and bring a lot of antisthetics
Motherfuckin bodies are beheaded, niggaz are shredded
So nigga get ready to meet your fuckin fate, when I send six trey-eight
straight into your motherfuckin chest plate

Yo yo
Bob Digital and Kool G Rap, we set the booby trap
African wiz wit the gat inside her dooby wrap
Derelict rhyme crabs, you rappin for a Scooby Snack
Foul-tongued bitch, you bound to lick my doody crack
Verbal pellets spray, tec sound makes my amex
Every slap on my snare drum son could break necks
You get yanked up and spanked up, your face shanked up
Who the FUCK raise your rank up?
I blow your tank up, pop the lock on a cop handcuff
Puff a dutch of dust, bust the jump' up and snuff out the judge
Fuck a cell block, black top capsule, the mailbox
It's heavy-bone birds stash glock in the nailshop
One the strip, took a sip, twist the L top
The God jewels son sound like a third rail shock
The gold crossbone, doorag, universal flag
Blast at the turbo charge and purple herbal drag
Known for the W, carry a double-two in the shoe
Iron snub rubber noose in the bubble goose
Bullets soaked in oil, hot heat will flame broil
Wu-Tang slang I bang makes your brain coil
Shaolin gods we known to stack cakes
Desert Queen projects son, they bake cakes
Uptown Pilan dogs, you make cakes
Cold Medina sons, they known to take cakes

That's how we do thangs, that's how we move thangs
Shoes paid wit two in the brain

Got my dick blew in the Range
My nigga keep it true to the game
It ain't no tellin what I do to you lames
If my mood change, choose to aim
Do you and your dudes the same
Go against grain and lose a fame
Who claim life in the thug lane but life is real
Lead come out of pipes of steel
Rob, kill, or heist for mills
Spill as I let out and slice your grill
Nigga don't think twice to peel
Just open shop and dice to grill
Send the six out, bust crib route
To the brickhouse, steppin on new terrain, bring the click out
The streets don't wanna see you read, let a clip out
These niggas slip out, make they blood drip out
Yo we divide the cakes to rise the stakes
Me and my apes die for papes
Bust heat and hide from jake
Up in the skyscrape, on top of the world
Back is up against the wall, gun brawl

(Scarface excerpt) That chick hes with....she like me. Oh  she likes you
huh? How do you know? The eyes Chico....they never lie. What  are you
serious? Yeah  I'm serious....What do you think? Man  thats the bosses
lady  you're gonna get us killed. The bosses lady? fuck you man!....the
bosses lady...huh...that guys soft....you got some of that for
me?...would you kiss me if I wear that hat?
Verse 1 (Kool G. Rap)
I had to have her, since my first glance at her
pimp stance at her
watchin' men throwin' Banjamins and Grants at her
bottles of Italy and France at her
advance at her, spit romance at her
Champagne glasses chatter
ass fatter than that actress up in Family Matters
lips thicker than Mick Jaggers
dick so hard the shit could stab her
she pushed a sick Jaguar
paint shined like it was black lacker
she carried a small gat for back up
whole shit spectacular
peepin' out her frame, walkin' in back of her
she had the hour glass shape
had my blood flowin' fast paced
past late, get that ass raped, fast tied up with mask tape
mad papes, I could tell by the way she was draped
her sex mate's caked up like Drake's
he's got the crib by the lake
wanted by the jakes
for takin' powder weight outta state
they straight sorrounded his crib with tower gates
garden lookin' like a flowered wake
every hour he make about enough dough to spoil this bitch sour
sex, money, and power, pussy good enough to devour
I hit her up inside the marble tiled shower
then snapped back to reality
he said her name was Valerie
dont fuck around with that Ho, a nigga's on the salary
pockets too low calorie
her man will get his cavalry
and straight turn the town to a shootin' gallery
Chorus - off his life, to get in good with the bosses wife, cross his
life just to floss his ice, to get him hit for the cost of rice, torch
the night, if the thoughts is right, bodies could get lost inspite
repeat once
Verse 2: (Chameleon)
The bosses lady, I cocks the four-fifth and holds it steady baby
my man ships more weight than the fuckin' Navy
out to get this gravy, so you can't take mine
you crossed the line
fuckin' with the bosses devine
ay yo, his mans, they commit crimes
found out you tryin' to fuck with his dime
you layed your life on the line
but the cards are in my hands
I love this rich man, and fuckin' you is not in the plan
I'm out to get grands and live on my own land
so why fuck with that help?
I'm livin' in wealth, you under his belt
hourglass figure I know you felt
wonderin' how the pussy smelt
lavish taste will have you livin' in debt
fantasizin' 'bout his wifes sex,
so how could you disrespect the man
that supplies the cash for your checks?
on the low 'cause you know he blaze tecks
and you fear for whats next
your life is in debt for tryin' to get my pussy wet
realize the bigger picture
I deal with bigger figures
I got no time for affairs with the average niggas
keep the lustin' to a limit
'cause ain't no benefits in it
too much to lose if I let you hit it
you know the force is deep
and you wanna creep
thinkin' how sweet it would be if I just let you eat
but to the boss yo, I gotta stay true
the chump change won't do
so me with you isn't happenin' boo
verse 3: (Both)
(G. Rap) I like ya style, kid you get wild
let the chips pile
my clique slit smiles across your mans throat so look who's big now
barkin' on shit like a (?)
lame chick you got this shit foul
we got the big bricks shipped in from miles
while I'm whippin' shit with 6 plus 6 valves
makin' millions off Fiscal
we regulated,
boo I guess you haven't heard the latest about these new agents
stackin' outrageous
(Chameleon) Yeah, I heard about the way you flip birds,
got these niggas standin' on the curb sellin' cocaine and erbs
you and my nigga exchanged words then parted ways
you swore to God all day
your squad would spray my man in all kinds of sick and retarded ways
(G. Rap) straight gave him a harp to play
(Chameleon) I peeped your resume
(G. Rap) you with me Angel?
(Chameleon) yeah, no doubt, but I should bang you

This goes out for all of the ones that's walkin' around here
Out in the streets blindfolded
Not knowin' what's really goin' on
Nawimsayin?
These streets is a habitat baby
Word up
Pito
[Verse 1]
In the garden of snakes, ain't no breaks, no mistakes
Just games that's played at high stakes, the next guys wake
Try ta fly strait, not violate if you wanna die late
The tri-state, crime at a high rate, where peoples dilate
Gun shots that make the block vibrate, it shook niggas migrate
Some die by fate, yo niggas cry hate
A fly facer get they thighs scraped
And little PUS that's why raped
A kid inside his gate get murdered by jake
A young nigga try ta fly capes, and get caught on the FBI tape
In verse of the State
Lost the case and gotta fry date
Ninety ninety eight, day of July eighth
Some cats get ta stack the hot papes
Live in the skyscrapes
Go ta airline, buy flyin' states
Where they can hibernate and operate
Impregnate, so ???
Other niggas will lay the power race, wit tre 8's
Try to apply weight, and ready ta die staced off and dehydrate
[Chorus]
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down

I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down

It's like a time bomb you hit Vietnam ta Saigon
Keep your mind calm, your nine on, me hard ta find harm
Peep the crime dons rollin' wit ex-cons holdin' they out rons
And teflons ta be streets flooded wit red ponds
Like it was red dawn, bodies get found around without the heads on
Judges set bonds that figures they know niggas is dead on
What's left of death penalty facilities where niggas step on
Wit those that blew trough, go get they body filled wit electrons
The tec drawns, the ones that live foul, they're leavin' wet moms
Wit lead charms, put her ta bed wit her head drawn
Killas wit red palms leavin' bodies cool as the dead fawns
Caught in the dead wrong, found they way, ran into the feds arms
Yo
[Chorus]
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?
Cannon fire light up the town
I stand my ground and hold the fort down wit the forty pound
You bust a round, I bust a round and lay your shorty down
On enemy territory grounds ta fall me down
Son how that sound?
[Verse 3]
For steady cash flows, niggas'll blast you past the Astros
Blow you like afros, the little fast hoes that last all the fast dough
They splash foes, red as Tabasco, they lay your asshole where the grass grow
Runnin' wit armies like they Castro
Them Donny Brasco's get Johnny Doj around they last holes
Keepin' em half froze, put in shiny boxes rockin' they last clothes
The cash close inside your top pocket of stashed roast
Body got found down on the back roads where all the trash blows
And broken glass globes, the dip chicks slicker than gastro
Who bag a slash blow and spot some top of the block hot as a gas stove
That's Mastro's cats in the Astros
Who ain't afraid ta let they gats go
The paper dash bros lovin' the flash though
And pass mo'
Stash rolls, count em like math pros
And crash low soda, PoPo's don't step all up in they path yo
Them cats go, that's smack on the back burner, but keepin' the gas low
When task rolls they snatch his ass mows, movin' too ass slow

Verse 1
I regulated you from fake dudes to lake views
minks with laced jewels
nails, hairdo's and facials
placed you in snake shoes
did it up right, took the six night seven day cruise
the beige creludes
your pockets stay full, upgraded you, made me wait too
I made you my suede boo, main chick, wifey and Angel
put ten Karrots on your wrist, five on your ankle
my whole angle, allow you in my triangle
to shine and twinkle, eat steak off a platinum single
these other cats is rectangles, they sweat bad girls
they Bullwinkles, tricks of Rip Van Winkles
but now you mingle with a real cat that gets the Pringles
and all you gotta be is thankful that we can see the sea food menu's
push whips, hit all the venues
fly gear sharp as Ginsu's
stare at the other pairs of gym shoes
as long as you continue, to keep it genu
never pretend to, I know its in you

with tight Nani, sippin' on Cristal and Donny
roll with mad Parmesani

staright overdose of high post

Jamaican Rum inside the Kiwi
play the major leagues, them other cats is pee-wee
they see me and you boo, plush cribs in Malibu
I'll profile with you, push my whip a mile or two
you can have it all 'cause I like the style in you
all you gotta do is be real and stay true
chill in the Jacuzzi with the G tatoo by ya lap boo
we can run around and act fool

Cristal inside the ice pail dont stop
drop top, SEL, cell on lock

you think not? you could see though
go from Moschino to Tuxedo's
as long as you only fuck me though
house with the twin gazebo's
Ceelo's, with the Champaigne orders by the waters of Puerto Rico
peep the live show featuring Tito
rockin' your fly Donna's
private jet to the Bahamas
you still knockin' all the Mommas
premadonna on the set
mad fly jewels around the neck
cut perfect
the linen skirt set
didn't even flip the long Sable fur yet
the iced out burgette with the matchin' purse set
five thousand when the Shanelle was purchased
strictly for the purpose
I stress you to roll with mine
lookin' live
close from a day old drive, push a five
jet ski drive, skooba-dive

Foul cats scheamin up the setup
Tryin to leave me and my cream wet up
Two in the head  leaded up
Call the coroners to make they bed up
Infrared shit from neck up
Before they got to lit the tec up
[Kool G Rap]
It was a setup  my nigga got hit  they blew his chest up
The hollow tips ripped his vest up  son is messed up
and blessed up; call my cast up    it's time to dress up
Four-fifth and Smith-n-Wessed up, ready to press up
and fuck their nest up, the enemy is Hennessey to sessed up
Actin up, hit my motherfuckin man up
Never again will he stand up, yo Big Jan hook the plan up
Pull the masks, pull the van up
These niggaz tryin to hit the fam up; these small times cats
Yo fuck that, I can't see that, where them niggaz be at?
Where they hang at? Where they live at? Where they slang at?
(Aiyyo Son one is a known cat, he walk around with the chrome gat
This hoodrat know where the nigga home at)
Well here's a quarter baby, go and phone that
This motherfucker bout to get his shit blown back
His whole dome clapped, we cock back the gats and started cruisin
Up the boulevards and avenues-n, I'm short fusin
and two biscuit usin; mad hot but, not in the mood for losin
We hit the strip pickin up clues and
we on the heels of this nigga shoes and
out the blue when, we see the chick the nigga screwin
Pushin his whip with the ice cuban
Hemmed her up sweet, put heat to her wig piece, the zig piece
to this nig's beefs, this bitch named Charise
from East New York, listen bitch, you better talk
Or get your whole frame surrounded, with white chalk
Pulled the rat in back of the van, bitch we don't want you
we want your man, you understand?
The hoe said, ""Please, I got his house keys, the nigga got
five keys and mad cheese, a hundred G's""
Lie to me bitch you gettin one of these
Four-five C's in both knees, she said, ""Honestly I promise G
I'm not lying,"" then the hoe started crying
We hit the road me and my niggaz flying
to the crib in Jackson Heights, the nigga live three flights up
He type buck, but I ain't givin a fuck
Grab his bitch up, make the hoe go first in case
the nigga buck, open the door up, and put the stunt in front
Then we all started creepin, he stretched out
up on the sofa sleepin, yeah me and my cats standin there
just peepin, money's about to get laced
My nigga Ty threw a glass of whiskey in his face
Big Jan ready to blaze the place; he on his way
to Amazing Grace -- nigga woke up and saw the big guns
Me and my two sons, he knew he was done
You hurt a loved one, step back about to let him have one
Yo fuck that, aiyyo black, where the sack of heroin at?
I'm bout to give cat some motherfuckin railroad tracks
We dumped the whole bag inside a spoon and left the room
to heat that, and came right back, yo grab the nigga arm black
Put raw shit in the nigga vein, watch the needle drain
Went from being restrained to mad 'tane
Less than a moment nigga started zonin
His mouth foamin, lookin like he posessed by The Omen
His bitch was reachin for the phone and, I had to smack her
with the chrome and, left her on the floor moanin
Cocked back, I had to finish this, know my stee'
we leave no witnesses, shot and got the fuck out the premises

Some think that I'm a flake, but I'm no fake nigga cause I
Drink a bitch, make him a witch and burn his ass at the stake
With the .44 mag it's so simple
Put it to his temple, fuck it, I give a nigga permanent dimples
Easing up on the fast slow, but I let your ass know
The block's too hot like Tabasco
Brand New Heavies on the tracks, G Rap on the wax
Cold bumping, got motherfuckers doing jumping jacks
You motherfuckers lost it
I bake your ass like a cake and all y'all flakes get frosted
Cause when G Rap is on the mix
Niggas start shitting bricks and turning into chick with small dicks
So a bitch, lyrics with a live band
(Yo this shit is funky) Yo fuck funky, the shit hit the fan
Shame if you're stepping to my set
You niggas get wet, nah fuck it, it's just a motherfucking death threat
Yeah, I got you bitches on lockdown, you niggas get knocked down
You're running cause I'm gunning your block down, punk
So save the bitch riff cause my four-fifth lifts
I'm tossing stiff off of fucking cliffs
Get close, I got you on scope, you walking on thin rope
So I'm a shoot 'em up like dope
Cause to make my notes I'm a cut throats
Bodies are thrown off boats and do a dead man's float
Straight down a river
Huh, with a bullet inside his motherfucking liver
Another hooker got thrown out
Stepped right into the crossfire and got her brains blown out
So you niggas better buck
Cause when my coat's full of buckshots, I don't give a fuck
You think you're down with the murder guys
Bullshit, say hello to that dirt you're gonna fertilize
You wonder why the area's stark
Homicides just fell ten bones since our car drove
When they opened the other trunks that were closed
Full of five unidentified John Does
All found dead on arrival
Cause I pulled up slowly and made 'em holy like Bibles
They find a letter and cassette
Red and said it's just a motherfucking death threat
Send the bodies to the morgue for a freezing
I got the motherfucking finger on the trigger cause it's nigga season
A punk tried to drop me
I left the body sloppy so they can't perform an autopsy
Dig a hole for the bitch
And put all his pieces and bits inside a ditch
Yo, you don't think you're going under
I got a bullet with your name, your address, and your phone number
So if you want to play games
I'm blowing you the fuck out the frame
You tried to front and got murdered last night
So now you float to the motherfucking light
So I'm a step to your grave and make a toast
And start shooting at your motherfucking ghost
So may the Lord be with ya
Cause I ain't no saint and I don't paint pretty pictures
It ain't nothing but bloodshed
Stains of brains on the rug and less blood in your head
You want to make me upset?
Huh, then I'm a promise you a motherfucking death threat

Wasn't livin like Thanksgiving, I was turkey without the stuffin
Sometimes I sweared to God that I was headed for the poorhouse
Say mama caught the drama, she would bleed tryin to feed 4 mouths
Wasn't rockin Girbauds, I barely had clothes, and when it snowed
and temperatures droppin below zero, you know I froze
No CD's, a black and white TV, a seat is a rubber tire
with a hanger for the antenna, turned channels with some pliers
Had nothin in my cabinet, but cans of Raid
I'm knockin on my neighbor's door
to borrow a cup of sugar for my Kool-Aid
I wasn't freshly dipped, my gear was straight ripped, I'm trippin
cause my winter coat got lost buttons
and zippers that wouldn't stay zipped
I never remembered ?, the brother was straight fat cat
Not even a Big Mac black, I had Kid Castle topped with crackerjacks
Walkin the streets, with the weak sneaks on my feet
And the freaks wouldn't speak, I never had lipstick on my cheek
So much for gettin humped from the stunts, I always struck out
The one y'all likes is takin hikes if you can't pull a buck out
So now I gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world!
I'm blowin up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, youknowhatI'msayin? I'm blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world!
I'm blowin up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...
It seems like only yesterday, my moms was on my back
""Get your butt up out the sack and find a job or hit the road Jack""
Black, I don't disown her, I'm just a kid from Corona
with a G.E.D. diploma, with more ribs showin than Tony Rhoma's
In order to get straight, I gotsta to make a muscle
Learned to hustle and bustle and I gave the streets a tussle
Standin down on the corner slangin fat rocks to bottles
with the black tops, for cops got my shorty watchin my back Hobbes
Makin mad lucci, bought up Louis Vuitton gucci
Hoochies callin me boochi, while they smooch me, givin up the coochie
Now I'm a felon, started sellin and splittin melons
I started gellin, to tellin police just cause I was swellin
Hangin out on the corner playin cee-lo, rollin for half a kilo
Yo you'll never see G-low a-goin below
Yeah, straight gettin fortunate, as long as fees was torchin it
It started gettin hot around the block, the cops was scorchin it
But luckily I made out before the coppers could frisk me and diss me
cause business is drugs is gettin too risky
So now I just lamp, collect stamps, snatch up tramps diamonds and pearls
Straight up baby, I'm blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world!
I'm blowin up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines

Blowin up, blowin up in the world!
I'm blowin up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines
I gotsta get mines, yeah...
I got put on by DJ Polo, cut the record, ""It's a Demo""
and started chillin in limos with champagne and tinted windows
Hoppin, no time for pages, sportin gold chains and rings
Clockin money and fame, nothin changed, I'm still the same
Just spendin 20's and 10's at women pullin on my linen
and grinnin cause I was winnin in this game from the beginning
The lyrical skills was kinda ill, gave you a slight chill
So I just let the hype build, known for rappers run and go write wills
I turned from a hobo to a solo bozin for dolos
Stole my dough, you still below, now I perfer cigars and blow Mo'
So catch a flashback, of a G. Rap track, attacked, like a headcrack
that's smack, through your cap, with the lead black
And here's a new cut, for pooh-butt, rappers hangin from off my
two nuts like they was put there by members of the Ku Klux
So peep Kool G. Rap, don't sleep, money unless it's witcha girl
Straight up kid, I'm blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world
Blowin up, blowin up in the world!
I'm blowin up the world, I gotta get mines, I gotta get mines

I knew a youngster  met him at 14  a very short scene
Fiendin to make his dreams come true  but see  money was caught mean
Started runnin wild and livin life type of foul  that was my shorty's style
But deep down in heart he was still only a child
He was typin nice at ball  if he had height  y'all
Mighta been 'NBA Today'  instead I watched his life fall
Blowin up the spots and poppin them tec glocks
Collectin street props, splittin tops, didn't stop, so many men dropped
Started committin murder after murder
Blasted the last nigga that tried to riff so fast he flipped him like a burger
Slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
He got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
And this type of street violence today happens too often
It hit me hard as hell to see my dog up in the coffin
People droppin a rose when the casket is closed
Hey yo, that's the name of the game out on the street, that's how it goes
They say: ""Live by the trigger, die by the trigger""
It ain't about whose gun is more bigger, nigga
It's bout whose draw is quicker
So to my shorty dog puzzled I'm pledgin
Died at the age of 17, Brooklyn East New York legend
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another
[VERSE 2]
Thinkin back when I was chillin with K-Von, but now he's long gone
So I carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
Me and black-o way back in childhood when we was wild hoods
Runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good
Started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
Then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
Then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
Started bouncin uptown to stuck up, my nigga straight blew the block up
Yeah, the blue and whites was on sight runnin with flashlights
On the double a fast life, that's when he seen his last nights
Out on the street runnin from the heat
Then got locked up from (Happy New Year!)
All the way down to (New Year's Eve!)
The two of those in a wardrobe of clothes
Got back on crackin, I let him whip the macks and go lookin for hoes
And then another sad story is headed for me
When i found out another soldier died in the territory
So in memory of my dog I write a lyric
Straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
Hear it when I get biz for K-Von, I'm pledgin
Died on 104 Northern Boulevard, Corona, Queens legend
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street, money, and look out for one another 3X
(Tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers)
Keep it real on the street

Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A.
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it
Verse One: Kool G Rap
Champagne wishes of caviar dreams ?a penis didn't cream?
With sales of fish scales from triple beams I gleam
Livin the live of rowdy packin fifty cali's
Rockin lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count mad for seen bad
We've seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that portray us on the block get rocked like Domateus
Fakers get used to shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
that'll stray pop and put more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin straight crimy in our Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta come get through a whole army
The celo rollers money folders sippin bola holdin mad payola
Slangin a Coke without the Cola
Me and black don't fake jacks but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son
Chorus
Livin the fast life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens with the american dream
So we're plottin up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
(repeat 2X)
Verse Two: Nas Escobar
Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggaz be
The ghetto misery, shootouts and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin up my Lex over who's petrol
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like it's my first child, lickin shots, holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters, Wallaby down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G, ghetto wise guys
The luciano Frankie Aiel, Bugsy Seagal
Green papers with eagles from a tray that's illegal
*singer*        Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah
Verse Three: G Rap, Nas
[Rap] Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard
[Nas] It's choir attire standin on ground with one pivot
[Rap] Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers
[Nas] Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
[Rap] Bodies on ice
[Nas] Livin trife, rollin fixed up dice
[Rap] Gamblin Grants
[Nas] Handlin stamps
[duo] Moves are sheist
[Nas] My bankrolls, got the cops comin in plain clothes
[Rap] Tryin to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[Rap] Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin in cut inside ?perico?
Heat for foes, shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
in Carribean suites, deep, rippin beats with flows
[Rap] Aiyyo, we went from standin on blocks, without some socks
sellin rocks, to pickin up stock and boat docks with glocks
and got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, graveyards is buried with kings

Diamonds and jelly-jars, nigga yeah, proper shit
Even told you I was pumpin' on the block and shit
Who the first nigga that told you he would pop ya shit

And it's a shame you sorta rocks around a Lex' bezzle
Smacking niggas with stacks and ones
On the run, clappin the guns
Stacking crack funds and packing the slums
Told you how them kids blow off they radget for crums
Was among y'all niggas raps, was too attached to the huns

Bodies  covered in white sheets  are layin in the streets
Shit gets deep  as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks
and holdin glocks stolen from the cops to get props
You gotta split a top  on the regular
or get plugged in your mug, from a slug, by your competitor
Gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder, no wonder
Another brother six feet under
You know it ain't no jokin when the streetlights are broken
So keep your eyes open, or get ready for a, smokin 'loc
Step out of line, I hope you got your nine gun son
The Smith and Wess', you better press 9-1-1 (word up)
or make a run for it there's too many to tackle
The Big Apple'll put your ass on ice like a Snapple
So even though I rap I gots to stay strapped
Niggaz act up I back up (PI-YAH)
I bust a cap inside your fuckin hat
Don't even pose with them hoes, the swinger that you chose
just might be down with the foes, only the shadow knows
And ain't no lollipop, lollipop over here only the shottie pops

Today's headlines, another nigga dead
Six to the body and fo' to the head
Followed the red bitch in the bed full of lead
A drug-related case and now the place is filled with Feds
Ramshacked the shack, disclouse 'bout two kilos of dope
Two ounces of coke's caught in the pocket of his coat
So, another brother caught the ultimate surprise
with blown out brains, to drop stains on his eyes
Dazed as I sit back and watch the channel two news
Watchin his family goin through all the boo-hoos
You lose, like an Ill Street, the Blues are gettin deeper
Nothin left in the room except for him, the Grim Reaper
Police are takin ? snapshots, scoop up some blooddrops
Pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots
The cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street
So they just, pull out the white sheets, to cover up the dead meat
Seal off the area with yellow tape, draw the white
chalk around the body now the party has to motivate
One more outlaw, was murdered on the scene for the green
Died at the age of seventeen
Chorus
[Kool G. Rap]
Strollin the concrete, packin my heat, walkin the backstreets
I seen niggaz pull up, peepin me out the side a black Jeep
Six feet deep, that's where I'm goin if I'm slippin
Steady cockin my shit cause I already got the clip in
Now who's the first nigga to run up, here they come up
the block hardrocks with glocks rollin holdin they guns up
I buck, I buck, and then I struck one in the chest
Nigga shoulda wore a vest but now his ass is put to rest
But now I got three mo' niggaz, pullin triggers
Strays are ricochetin off the bricks, zigga zigga
But who got the biggest strap? Who's bustin bigger caps?
My BOOM BOOM BOOMS against they PAP PAP PAPS
No haps, G. Rap ain't goin out like a sucker
I reloaded the shot and dropped another motherfucker
Quick, I duck and shit to dodge the bullets comin at me
Cause I won't be too happy with a slug inside my nappy
Two more niggaz left, they scared to death, but I'm leary
Shit gets kinda scary when I got bulletholes near me
I went between two cars, lettin off the quarter pound
I see another body fallin down to the ground
Quick I run up on him cause I don't think that he's dead
Standin over his ass I put two more inside his head
That's three niggaz down, only got one nigga to go
I gots to send his ass to the gravedigger so
I lay low in the cut and wait for moneygrip to slip up
Nearly shot my whole clip up, I got one more slug to rip up
Look over by the GS, see his ass stickin his head out
Boom, let the lead out, blew a piece of his brain dead out
the back of his head, now he's dead, because he fell face down
right on the motherfuckin streets that he dwelled

Yo it's a hit  you picked the wrong cat to fuck with
The wrong thug kid to buck with  you better duck quick
or get your shit split  with infinite shit  from outta the clip
Niggaz is struck with the underworld click
Yo it was midnight and rainy and  spotted these three Panamanians
Gold chains  and carryin Iranians
Pulled out to stain me and  these cats might try to flame me
and shit  might be hit sent from this bitch nigga Damien
Used to slang 'caine, back to back, up in this game we in
Went against the grain when he got banged in his cranium
Now he got cats all on my back, tryin to bang me and
from Peru, flew in a crew of evil, now shit is lethal
Drew the Eagle, blew about two
and made one of the two see-through, but I still see two
of his peoples, up in a Regal, and they got heat to equal
shit that got put in Beenie Seagal, fuck these illegal
alien-ass niggaz out of the grass
Put extra clips upon the dash and continued to blast
Fire flashed, I left another one of em splashed
The bloodbath, three niggaz found dead on the ave
Went to a phone to hit my nigga Big C, swiftly
Yo dig the shit G, these niggaz tried to hit me
Yo meet me in about fifty, with Big Ash, be movin quickly
I'm about to hit D, put that motherfucker six feet
""Aiyyo what happened G?"" Niggaz on the ave was clappin at me
Bustin at me, tryin to put caps in my nappy
""Yo as long as you made it kid I'm happy""
We still goin to where this cat be, with AK's all day
Called up my nigga Jay, call the nigga Damien for me okay?
Make it about 3:38, straight, this is what you say
""Aiyyo we fucked up, he got away""
If he play, I'ma split his toupee, we on our way
to this nigga's office, with armed forces, he showin softness
and watchin, horses racin with other bosses
Pulled out the torch and, the nigga saw the guns, got stunned
He probably got none, knowin he bout to catch a hot one
Terrorizin the whole spot son, the phone rung
He acted like it was the wrong number, lookin all dumb
Hands on the glock spun, five minutes later, the shots rung
That nigga got done, died with his hand on a cocked gun
Yo it's a hit, you picked the wrong cat to fuck with
The wrong thug kid to buck with, you better duck quick
or get your shit split, with infinite shit, from outta the clip
Niggaz is struck with the underworld click
Yo it's a hit, you picked the wrong cat to fuck with
The wrong thug kid to buck with, you better duck quick
or get your shit split, with infinite shit, from outta the clip
Niggaz is struck with the underworld click
February 14 in '95, time about 4:45
I'm coppin pies in a highrise
Dealin with shit like this you need five eyes, dinosaur size
These fuckin chi-chi's, have you covered with flies
Came in with two wiseguys, fuckin guns big as lifesize
Had a chick up on the bed and shit, with the nice thighs
Yo senorita, mamasita, wish to plead with boricua cliqua
Arriba, flashed the heat now
she started talkin, seconds later two Cubans walked in
Holdin packages of silver chalk and, shit ain't the raw and
became a war man, he put two in my man's internal organs
But for the poison, tryin to fuckin Freemen like Morgan
Two hit the floorin, with blood pourin, left em snorin
Their wigs tore in, layin all up against the door then
the nigga spray, I caught a slug in my shoulder blade
My boulder grazed, I'm catchin flashbacks of older days
in the small caves, I'm dazed and shit
She goin to bed with the spray shit, tryin to lay shit
OK bitch, and fuck the gay shit, started to lay shit
and left the brave bitch wet, part of her neck and face hit
Emptied the clip, then replaced it
Niggaz is on the floor tomato pasted
wasted, spirit eras-ted
Bonnie cased it, went to the other side, embraced it
The whole place is lit, we Scarfacin shit
Cigar case and shit, on some marksmen shit
One nigga strainin moanin in pain aimin his biscuit
My man fixed it, left him with his wig twisted
Wipe all my fingerprint ballistics, went to the other room
and saw the brick shit, straight legit shit, bag it and zip it
Left out the front door like we ain't do shit
Yo it's a hit, you picked the wrong cat to fuck with
The wrong thug kid to buck with, you better duck quick
or get your shit split, with infinite shit, from outta the clip
Niggaz is struck with the underworld click
Yo it's a hit, you picked the wrong cat to fuck with

I know this chick  yo mami is rich  she push a six
Living some bloodshed  her man is pushing bricks
Crib way out in the sticks  they house looking slick
It's like some shit straight out of a Hollywood flick
Me and my clique met the chick up at Saint Nicks
Honey was thick  I was the first nigga to kick
Yo mami was thick  silk skirt with thigh split
I couldn't quit  trying to peep out the privates
The live shit, you know how loose I get
I'm scheming on her back, peeping her hips, fiending to hit
Plump cherry lips, medium tits, Chink eyes her baby hair chick
The type you want to pair with, have an affair with
? flip me the digits, to the hip and the phone flip
Said she had to split, hopped in the whip, headed up the strip
Probably had to get with her man and shit
Later on at night, I'm stressing love at first sight
Some ain't right, I ain't the type of cat like me
to be dealing with mad feelings
And even though mami was mad appealing
Body revealing and big wheeling
This shit is illin, I don't like it
Fuck it, I can't fight it
I reaching for the cordless to call Miss
I insist to get with this
Tan Tone answer the phone, ""Hello, who this?"" (chick)
""It's me baby, G Luciano, what up lady""
""Fine and how you doing boo"" (chick)
""Ain't nothing new but you, angel, yo why don't you swing through
""we could sip on some champagne from Spain boo""
About an hour or two she came thru, fly hairdo
We link, push in the six circle circle drink
To purple mink, had mad bank, Chanel bag full of Benjamin Franks
More ices than a hockey rink, face of a Saint
Went for a drink ? Hot shots
Would wanna spend those five digit o's, on bimbo's
Bar closed, back to her six double o, she drove
My eyes closed her nigga dozed, when I awoke
Saw mad snow, we at her spot at the Poconos
Bridge robes, crib hot as a stove
She changed out of her clothes, put on a silky bath robe
Panty hoes with see thru holes, pretty toes
Took me into the master suite, shit was sweet
Jacuzzi four feet deep, with satin sheets
As I was speaking to this half black/latin freak
Met on a Manhatten street, body petite, fat on the cheeks
I was getting open, started laughing and joking
We weed smoking, stroking, the shorty's spoke and
Said what the deal is, the realness
My man is crazy as Bruce Willis
If he catches us, he'll try to kill us
He got a whole army of Kiiers
Me no worry, I got the clapper son
End of the first verse, chapter one
Word
Shit is real in the field
Thug love story
[G. Luciano]
So here I am
Laid up in this lavish house, up in the Poconos
With this chick I don't even really know
Steady stressing me how ill her man is
So what I go and do, heh-heh, I nail her ass to the bed anyway
Straight twisting mami's back out
Hit three o'clock, fell right the fuck to sleep
Clothes still on, breath smelling like Henrock
Totally no kind of regards for this bitch's man
I guess it's just another one of those G Rap adventures
[Kool G. Rap]
The next day about a quarter to eight
I heard a squeek on the staircase
Got the gat from under the pillow case
Somebody broke in, now me and boo fully awoken
Good thing I slept inside my clothes and shorty was frozen
I'm waiting for a head to poke in, and start smoking
The home invasion, right through the door, he started blazing
Bullets was grazing, shit was crazy and
I had to think to fast, let the gun blast, duck, then dash
Heard a crash, they broke through the door, they on her ass
Jumped off the balcony like a falcon Gee
With honey right in back of me, feel on top of the snow in agony
Shit was thick, couldn't get to the six, they loaded the fifth
Saw the snowmobile yo fuck it
We start jumped it, get on top of the shit and peeled
Mad soldiers out in the field, busting they steel
The raw deal, kill or be killed, shit is real
Ten hit me right on my heels, trying to make a thugs blood spill
In zero degrees, niggas on skis, me and these Gees
Slipping through pine trees, we skid up behind these
Two big rocks and left off shots, about four dropped
The other six started to pop, I feel something hot
I think I got hit, my jacket is ripped
Loaded my last clip then broke out quick and checked the chick
She on my back tighter than shit, like vise grips
I started clapping, niggas rolled up in blowing black and
Spotted this Rover by a log cabin, we got our as in
Mash the gas, make the fucking wheel spin
The safety again, and still doing a hundred and ten
Shorty shivering, lips quivering, ski suits up in the back seat
Pulled over the Jeep get it in
And took a rest stop at the river bend
We living, we made it the fuck out, mad slugs delivering
Pretty soon we at my rest piece, up in the bedroom
Got shorty boo tending my bullet wound
Put on some tunes, she blew my shit like a balloon
Up in the moonlit room, and dicking her womb
Hitting full behind her, grinding her with my anaconda
She rode the dick like a honda
I took her to the point of no return like Bridgette Fonda
She back spasmed, giving the crazy orgasm, from steady rhythm
My dick glistened, her lips hit'em, I shot jism
Then laid back in the sack and lit the ism
I thought about the realism
Niggas coming and bring they steel with them
I got just the thing to deal with them
Nickel plate Mac, the laser attached, with two clips packed
Push a niggas whole head back, so I snatched that
So quick spread out and play the layout
Still on alert, me and the skirt, day in and day out
[G. Luciano]
Yo what's the matter mami, you scared or something?
[Mami]
I'm a little worried baby
[G. Luciano]
Yo, don't be worried about nothing, alright
Everything is gonna be alright
[Mami]
OK
[G. Luciano]
Look, we just gonna go to your house, go get the money
You know, we gonna get your backs or whatever
And we gonna get out of there, alright?
[Mami]
Alright, ven paca papi, dame un besito
[G. Luciano]
Alright, grab that bag money
[Mami]
Let's do this, baby
[Kool G. Rap]
After three whole days of lamping, we broke camp and
Went out to the beach, many mansions out in the Hamptons
Brung the clamp, ready to shoot shit up at random
Five hundred grand is buried in the sand
We planning, up in the crib-o with big windows, I'm counting the dough
She packing her clothes, had her Lexus in the back of the Rolls
I saw the keys, I grabbed the G's, we on and took those
Shit was sitting on some chrome momo's
Tinted windows, a LS Ford double O
Told the chick, yo you moving to slow
Speed it up baby, we got to go
And get this plane and hit the Caymans
With the payment, somebody came in
A platoon of goons with heaters aiming
I drew the Mac 10 and started flaming, they did the same and
Slugs spraying and blood raining, I left about seven thugs laying
But this one cat was gaining, he grab the dame and
Put the heater to the chicks brain and
I let my two guns drop, they got the drop
They took us both to a boat dock, then on a yacht
The chick's man was there with a sixteen shot
Nigga was hot, took the glock and hit me dead in my knot
Honey started to panic and yelling that money in spanish
Thinking he's out to take advantage
So we're out in the fucking Atlantic
With no lifesavers and stranded
Backhanded the chick on the floor, called her a whore
Said, ""amor you won't be pretty no more""
Took us on a tour, down in the deck
Guess he wasn't ready to kill us yet
Saw this nigga there, holding the Tec
Ready to wet, I'm started to sweat, a niggas stressed
We up beside a horrible mess
I saw a box with the letters on it S.O.S
So I took out a flare gun and shot the kid in the chest
Took the Tec from out his hand, now I'm ready to bless
The madness, put the rest of them niggas to rest
Looked around, the chick's man was the only one left
Threw his ass over board and told him hold your breath
Caught my breath, I seen honey down on the deck
Eyes closed with a bullet hole dead in her breast
Held her in my arms till her soul finally left
I'm mad depressed, my baby was an innocent death
A real thug lost the only women he loved
And I bugged, busting slugs at the stars above

Smack a nigga with the butt of the fifth

Fast loot tactics  I'm well up in the millionaire bracket
The boss of all bosses  I own racehorses and a fortress
corridors with olympic torches and Mona Lisa portraits
Jacuzzis and saunas and eatin steak at Benny Harner's
Bentley's limousine the front yard stream is full of pirahnas
I'm set  a private jet  I drink a lot of Beck's
Get a lot of sess condo and duplex, diamond infested Rolex
Deliver a crown at the world units with silver china
Sippin on finer wine-r you see more shines than diamond miners
The Highness, kingpin of heroin
I'm thorough when I have to bring the terror in
Handle business in each and every borough in
town or city, I'm rollin like Frank Nitty, I'm rich and pretty
Back up kiddies, I got crimies that's grimy and gritty
A nigga that's spunky and likes to keep his pockets chunky
Makin most of my money, from all the dopefiends and junkies
I learned from the best the ones that's livin
and the ones that's put to rest
So I bless my chest with a vest and pack a Smith-N-Wes
And then I'm off to get the snaps, not the scraps
The game is be a real mack, the name is Kool G Rap
Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes you wanna holler
I got a fly hoe up under the wing, a swinger that does her thing
And if you step inside my ring, she'll bang it out and make your brains hang
She sits at resteraunt tables with mink foxes and sables
Drinkin Cherenade brand label she'll rock a sucker's cradle
And yeah, honey is more bounce to the ounce
She walks around with lucci in large amounts
Millions inside Swiss bank accounts
Her name is Tammy, got a beach house in Miami
Rides around with a small jammy in her silk and satin panties
A down hoe, a Foxy Brown hoe, standin her ground hoe
And if you clown yo she'll turn into a bust a round hoe
Fly as a Heaven's Angel got sapphires in her bangles
Diamond earrings hangin dingle gettin money from all angles
She's pretty under the New York city bright lights
and real light, way after midnight, I hit it cause the slit's tight
Wake up early and make my rounds, break up break down
Packin a silver four pound, some clowns be trying to get down
Light up a smoke and grab a stack of C-notes
Them slick stick up kids don't get no free dough bro
cause I ain't tryin to be broke
I goes all out for G Rap and this honey nothin funny
It's a damn shame, what I gotta do to get the money
Now it's a damn shame, what I gotta do just to make a dollar
Living in this game, sometimes it makes me wanna holler

Bodies in camera view, for a grand or two
Land you on channel two
When niggaz can't eat, that's what the fam'll do
Leave you for the mantle, examine you
For the van to come transfer you
Too late to bandage you, too much damage to you
The coroners know how to manage you
Down in they land they planted you
That's what the cannons do, forever branded you
Spare cannoned you, abandoned you, rock you to sleep
Niggaz surrounded you, death wish granted you, fan at you
Went to my hundred shot clip when they flip & throw a grand at you
Peel your shit open like a can of brew
Then they work from the mandible, havin you livin where the salmon do

And shot vestibule; you got testicles

Fake cops, scrape from the teeth hot for residue
The foul slang liver(?) page, reach for that shit on your waist
Every killer in the place get hit in the face
Turn around, simmer down nigga, get in the safe
What you fear when the shots is blowin; shed a tear for the one
that caught one under the ear inside of his top popped open
It's death for all niggaz that left with the glock smokin
Came in with hot toast and left the whole spot soakin

left for the vultures, we DT's pickin' up cultures

swift with the words well

kicked up enough dust to hurt cells
swerve in SL's, niggas feel me like my shirt's brail
curve the jail cell for jakes that wanna H-block those
niggas in Paco's keep the blocks froze and the shops closed
where the pot grows, young cats coppin' the drop Roves
get the Nacho's, and no cops show when the shots blow
shit's red hot though, the streets remain flooded with D's
bundles of Ki's to maintain a hundred degrees

we handle the beef in .9 ways
get your mind grazed

who's full of malice? what thug's the wildest?
act childish and get your body sent to a stylist
who live the foulest? be grippin' cannons 'till my hands is kalused
pile this paper longer than malice from Ney York to Dallas

land on Casino roofs in Helicopters in Las Vegas Nevada
can't stop until I got a Casa up in Trump plaza

cream like Iri Amin Dada
thug saga, slugs burn you like they lava
you and ya bimbo get hit up through ya car window
creep on your benz slow and let ten blow
from out the darkest shadow

Permanent cash, put you in the tourniquet fast
Feed you glass and use you to fertilize the grass
Puff green when we fiendin to murder ya whole team
For cream, the infrared beams'll shatter your dreams
I flatter your queen and rip her right out of her jeans
Intervene and it's the homicide scene for your team
[Chorus]
[AZ]
From hideous acts on the one gettin rid of the gats
A nigga back, no parole, now how pretty is that?
The city is trapped, bottles popped, Phillies is cracked
Niggaz is strapped, half bent, illin, spillin they 'gnac
Cars tinted, my rap image too large to mimmick
We mob in it, fake niggaz dissolve in minutes
It's codes to it, real killers they know music
Even hoes on the low at the shows lose it
Courvoisier-sippin, this slim nigga stay flippin
My ways different, duck when the AK spittin
It's more to it, verbal wisely, all fluent
In real life this is how the dogs do it
Double-edged sword, rep for y'all seein the board
See y'all home soon, it's better than seein the morgue
So what's the conflict, who wanna Don with this?
For the streets strictly we got the bombest shit
[Chorus]
[Kool G Rap]
Two violent niggaz sit at the round table, in brown sables
Chains hangin down to the navel
Brooklyn and Queens connect get down fatal
Hold the four-pound stable
Won't hesitate to rock a clown's cradle
Get put in the dirt like ground cable
Found from bloodhound nasals
Or deep in the river get found naval
That shit y'all spit sound fable
""American Me"" style, knife in the anal; who 'round to save you?
I leave you from waist down disabled
Face split like a round bagel
Found in a hospital gown witcha crown stapled
Wrong one to tangle with, a gym star, spangle your shit
Use your handkerchief to strangle your bitch
Single niggaz out on the strip and bang in a clip
Slugs from a Desert Eagle mingle the click
A force of habit, for me to let it rip across your attic
Never violent with a silent but I toss your cabbage
[Chorus]
(Beotch!)

Who bet they best against mine?
I press the west and let the vest protect mine
Led crimes that head the headlines and spoke cake times
I used ta catch shines
Rockin' when I see you next time
Neva but greater threat, I make mine
Soon as I let the infared shine
Everybody know it's hit the deck time
Don't go against mine
I make a whino bleed red wine
Sometimes my own peoples slick talk, try ta test mine
Get outta line, so I give em deadlines
Even disrespectful respect mine
Light weighted but I rep mine
I don't lift weights, but I bench press a tec 9
I'm known for holdin' big shit
The last time I showed the biscuit
I made this dude sweat enough bullets ta load a clip wit
When cops drop warrants and try ta get me bagged up
All they hear on they walkie-talkies is ""I need back up!""
Papoose the braid blaster since jakes want me in the cage captured
I roll wit more niggas than slave masters

I froze the gate, walkin' across the seas like a Moses maid
Approachin' rappers, me and G Rap be the rapper clappers
Shotter wit tecs, we break y'all down like y'all common factors
Steady heat, that's when the juvy proceed
I'm makin' rappers bleed off this rapilism, my feet
I ain't playin' games, y'all rappers betta code in my name
The juvenille strait from Brooklyn, wit the slugs of the same
So play you're position, stop it, I makes you grab their attention
Like a magnet ta somethin' metal, so y'all blinkin' and flickin'
I'm takin' over for the 9 era, it's now or never
Cuz when I get in the door, bringin' drama cuz my rhymes is betta

Call in the cider box, 6 blown in your chest and dome
For tryin' ta hold the fort down, but couldn't hold it

My lawyer's a close friend of the senator
You was full of shit, you shoulda took a enema

Swingin' gats like pendulums, shit out the nine double, I'm him and em

Sendin' em, but sick of all this, I take a step back
And spit the torris in yo moms and chick won't trist ta hit the floor is
Makin' em clip the forest, it's G scar fold
Turnin' yo body weight ta cargo
While I stretch ya, ya bet ya'll lay fall go
Harps played in the dark like he was harpo

Scoffed for the card he is in Bossolino
Scammin' the profits in casinos
Knock wigs off like therapy wit kimo

You're scared straight as soon as G Rap penetrates
You wanna escape, but you got a date to meet fate
Run for your life when I'm starting
Suckers are getting turned to missing motherfuckers on a milk carton
Danger, when I rearrange and change a face, ace
You're being replaced by a stranger
I injure, and escape like a ninja
You got struck by a fucking revenger
A bullet inserted in your head, a shot got
Murdered, nobody seen shit, nobody heard it
Fuck around, the price is more than McDonald's pays
And you can sing my blues to Billie Holiday
Put your ass in my path and I'm a blast it
Mind over matter, I burn like battery acid
Terrorizing, sizing up the guys-a
Finger on trigger, when I pull it, a bullet flys in
G's a madman, came from the Badlands
Crush niggas in my bare hands like beer cans
Leaving a gash like the New York Slasher
Showing my inches in a trench like a flasher
You got a problem, I'm a problem solver
Solve more problems with a .357 revolver
Come near you pay dearly
And I can barely hear when you talk so speak up clearly
On a sole role, the golden mic holder
And I flatten your ass just like a steam roller
Pity for niggas I waste
Try to disrespect, get the taste of a neck brace
I got your ass on target
You got beef? You better save it for the motherfucking meat market
Rhymes choke you like a headlock
If a sucker's asleep, I turn his shit into Bedrock
Come on son, get done in
Niggas are running like the redcoats is coming
I enlist punk niggas that want some of this
And what's left is the breath of a death wish
(""Rappers go six feat under"") (Repeat 4x)
A pimp that loves shrimps and lobster
And for a hobby I'm hitting niggas up like a mobster
I got a story for each little poor territory
The ghetto glory in all categories
The death threats I received from the head vests
I'm riffing, the suckers stiffen up like a dead pet
The troop that stoops to brutality
Giving all nationalities a taste of reality
Kool G Rap is here to draw
And any sucker that tries to beat him, you meet him in a morgue
All victims unidentified, so check it
You gotta see if it was the sucker from the dental record
What I use to torture liars:
Either fire, barbed wire, live wire, or pliers
So you thought you could last?
Go and get a green thumb because your ass is grass
Eric B. is the undertaker
His pockets swoll because he's rolling in more dough than a baker
Quiet type, but I won't have it
Cause when I swing with the boys I get noisy like traffic
So if you know what I know, see what I see
G Rap is down with a mafioso posse
And I'm quick to go stick other suckers
With a smile just like a sick motherfucker
A bullet inside the sucker's guts and
Hit butt and his nuts, we throw him in the Hudson
This is for all the non-believers
They receive a gash in their ass from a meat cleaver
Don't even try to get fast
You know the time because I'm 5 seconds off your ass
A nightmare leaving you suckers breathless
You stepping to Kool G Rap, then that's a death wish

It's Big 1 son  Jamaica Queens is the turf
And I'ma exploit  heaven and earth  for what it's worth
It's the MC extrordinaire  the jewels glare
The God is rare  I'm takin bitches back to my lair
I want mines and yours, strippin niggaz to they drawers
No probable cause, with the chrome double 4's
It's the Queens New Yorker with a bulletproof parka
In eighty-four, it was Calvins and British Walkers
Now I'm sippin Harvey's Bristal Cream with the glock 17
as the sirens race to the scene
Tryin to get dough, like Pablo, today, fuck tomorrow
Seats for carro, as I recline in Monte Carlo
I got the game down to a science, it's the clients
that turn small time hustlers into giants
Three course meal, waitin for my appetizer
Blowin like a geyser, time only makes me wiser
Paraphenalia, and material, makes the crew imperial
I put the fear in you, sippin beer with two
Handlin business properly, form a monopoly
Storefront property, if not, another robbery
I'm puttin forth the effort, murder's the method
The steak is peppered
Son when I let off you meet your Lord and shepherd
Bloody money gets niggaz deaded and wetted
Don't forget it, money's the metal and my hand is magnetic
Chorus: Grimm, B1
I gotta flip these bricks

Money's on my motherfuckin brain

Money's on my motherfuckin brain
Cause money and murder go hand in hand
It ain't nothin but a game
Money's on my motherfuckin brain son
[Grimm]
Cryin hopin God forgive me for the ones I killed
But until still, I dry my eyes with hundred dollar bills
Like McDonald's, makin mills servin
Fuck a Landcruiser now, pulls a ? to Suburban
Stressed out, sittin thinkin past bed time
Scared can't sleep, nightmares about fed time
Diamonds, linens, ostrich and all that
Fat shit I'm talkin code cause my phone's tapped
Crackheads worship me like I'm Jesus
Uncle Sam can't stand me cause I'm fuckin all his nieces
Cuties every colour, who I wanna fuck next?
Buy a new car, maybe Lamborghini trunk next
Look at the jealousy in the eyes of the roughnecks
Bulletproof glass just in case they wanna buck Tecs
A large ratio in this game dies
But I'm flippin pies, til the Senate legalize
Chorus: Grimm, G. Rap (same lines)

I'm sportin flavors and Timbs, a ninety-five Bezn with the chrome rims
Presedential Rolex, two carat diamonds with the stone gems
Pockets filled with lucci leather wallets designed by Gucci
Parlay in resteraunts, eatin shrimp, scampi and sushi
Fly minks, with icicles that blink inside cuban links
Lookin ?, brothers stink, got loot like I'm doin banks
Hundred dollar bottles of chammy, condos in Miami
Front row seats up at the Grammy's, the broke niggaz can't stand me
Hold the flame low, hotel suites inside the Flamingo
Just home by the dingos, I step up in em rockin Kangols
Straight up fakin no jacks, cause all my crackshacks are jam packed
My mad stacks, show that I'm on the right track, like Amtrak
So stand back, cause I'ma make whatever it takes
to shake Jakes, and shoot snakes, and bake more snowflake cakes than Drake's
Cut up your grill like I'm the Barber of Seville
Still like Gotti bodies are found inside the harbor cause I'm ill
It's war, but no more kids are bein kidnapped, matter of fact
ain't with the shit black, I was young when I did that
There's dope in the Copa Cabanas, cock back the hammers
So niggaz in pajamas get they wigs split like bananas

This shit is bigger than killin the President
Ignor-Entertainment up in this motherfucker y'all
[Verse One]
It's nothing!  Infrared beams laser the place
Two straps, radiate at the waist, I'm a marksmith
Them things bark man, sprayin with haste
Shit razor gladiator your face, soakin your strip
Hoodied up, loc in the whip, pokin the clip
Arm extended out the window, chokin the fifth
Legend or myth seek a Taliban, hit Babylon
Don't misinterpretate the smile of a Don, I'm fowl as a swan
Get at you, spit at you with ya child in ya arms
Clap at your bitch, full semi'matics eclipse
Display rage like an evil omen
Trust me in the backseat when you drivin
I'll pop your fuckin cerebral open
Take position when them snakes hissin
End up nickel-plate kissin, out of state missin
Get gravelled in the battles and wars, rattle the four
Cause cattle when you rhyme big you sound like you horse
Let's do it
[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
It's nothing!  Dudes'll talk like they killers
But they eyes can't disguise the fact they really fear us
It's nothing!  Them big rims on the truck
That slim hoe that you pluck?  That flossin'll get you stuck dude
It's nothing!  This ain't your ordinary rap
It's extrordinary scrap - Cris', pour the Henny back like
It's nothing!  (What's my name?)  G Rap, Giancana
No throwbacks are fitted, we own rap and spit like
It's nothing!

Five star general ranked in the game I don't respect y'all seargeants
I wreck you varmints, eject them comments, and wet y'all garments
I bank sure as the flames from out them Texas orange
Keep fresh hoes in flesh and bondage, collect and garnish
This ain't a threat it's a promise; give you a hospital bed
and a harness, reps get tarnished if you don't hit that deck
for homage and beg for your pardon, G Rap head of the squadron
Kid be sent to alarmin; you flipped and stepped out of margin
You infuriated the Gods and the stars and
The sky's bout to thunder, you low-life come out from under
About to heat your winters and drought your summers
One right up on your fort, forty-five Colt buckin the horse
Give your body your nuts in divorce
Dick in the dirt, you flip to the earth
Check where the hit tip grippin the shirt
Get a flashback, flick to your birth
It's war for you mo-rons, we wave four arms
Draw with arms, more arms and more arms and more arms

When I was a young buck I played with chrome

Get my stage on, the rage is on, my nigga

Brothers on the corner sellin junk
got held up by the hotties got the shotties in the trunk
You got the hardrocks wavin glocks at the punks
Police only harass you when they wanna get a chunk
They got so many corners and they got so many spots
And I can't even bump up the block
without the, ""Yo man, what you got?""
I'm walkin past somebody lookin strange
He's lookin for a hit for veins
or he'll blow out somebody's brains
Even the shorties livin naughty lives
Walkin around, even drive around, with big forty-fives
I just found out the candy store's a front
They walk in the candy store
Man G, candy's far from what they want
You might see a pickle or a popsicle
But if you step to the back, you get dimes, twenties, and nickels
Honey used to look like a winner
Now she can't even get took to dinner
cause so many dealers ran up in her
Somebody's blood is on the tar
Last night was a homicide from a fight inside the bar
Loudmouth tryin to show her ass, but somebody
broke a whiskey bottle and cut her butt up with the glass
Money got robbed for his bank
They broke in his house and took everything
except the kitchen sink
Little man murdered on the scene
He tried to come off at the liquor store, he's only 17
Granny's damn near pushin 80
A couple of hoods grabbed her pocketbook, and stabbed up the lady
Cover your head, cause it's a dead zone, in the red zone
Yeah, this is my home sweet home
Three card molly, another man to fool
Whites will stop at the red lights, to look at us like animals
I'm gettin frisked by the cops
They only tryin to get props, for blowin off a black man's top
Up in apartment 3G, this sweetie named DiDi wants to see me
but yo I heard she's givin VD
Just when you think the skies are gettin blue
Bang bang -- another brother's split in two
Can't sleep, cause the streets are filled with danger
Miss, your little daughter's a swinger, you can't change her
She left with a stranger, inside a drug dealer's party
Now off to the morgue, to go indentify her body
Sonny boy is goin on the strip
Robbin niggaz cracks, with a mac, without a clip
Somebody gave a tip, so the next time he flipped
and shorty got ragged, another bodybag is zipped
A baby is born and needs lovin
but instead, the mother smothered him and shoved him in a oven
Cops killin our kids, but they bill us
So what's more worse, the killer cops or the Cop Killers
Everyday's another risk
I'm even mad to go to my pad, the hallways always smell like piss
No heat, just pots of hot water
I'm walkin eight flights up, the elevator's out of order
Man that landlord is the lowest
Because I let my door slam and saw a damn eviction notice
I felt like breakin all his bones, pssssh
I'm gettin kicked out of my home sweet home

You're just a Kit Kat, on some Tic-Tacs, but I'm a Big Mac, cuz I'm G Rap.
Fully equipped with a hip hop lip, my memory bank is like a microchip.
My bass will give a shake, or if not quake,
it'll make you, sucker MC, wanna jump in the lake.
Cuz I'm murder, homi-cide, color.
Must kill and destroy with excitement and drama.
Weakest, I'll seek her, you become weaker.
My art is the smoke, my materials and media.
So rap alert for ya, devastate the area.
I'll give a grain of your...lyrical mania.
Power source, and a G enforced, your headboards, and they could be rap wars.
So come one or two, 'cept for a few.
Doubles and couples -- and I'll grip 'em like tools.
Cuz boy, you can't handles this, none or any, one or many, some or plenty.
Cuz I'm not the stranger, just the rhyme arranger.
Highly explosive, keep out, danger.
Packin' Gs while you try to beat me,
but for these MCs who go on and wannabe Gs.
What I write is in a smoking section; here's an injection of rap perfection.
So what the heck, you select my dialect.
Next man's cassette, yo, reject and eject.
Cuz I could use a technique, smart as an antique.
Beats that I repeat show you that I can speak
totally, probably, you rappers wanna copy me.
It takes strategy just like Monopoly.

Cuz when I start rappin', I keep the people clappin'.

The tec and mac-10 flames begin
Thugs to the end, my whole crew insane with sins
Hammers to firing pins
Me and my kin be makin you spin
The Lord or The Devil takin you in
[Kool G. Rap]
It's the Corona Queens apocalypse
My block is hit with the dark eclipse
Takin no hostages, so grab the glocks and clips
The rap's apostle-ist, niggaz to Loch Ness
Large as Colossus is
Mumblin shit get shot at the esophagus
A Thug Saga novelist
Sex in this rap shit monogamous
Rainin like the drop is while you be topicless
Blow money monopolist - do it for eons
Shinin like it's, neon - heart colder than freon
Decidin which MC to pee on;
baby cause that's the shit that we on
Niggaz go to Warrick like Deion
Put the G on
I analyze guys with Montana eyes
to vandalize any man alive, soon as the hammer rise
Cut em down like samurais
Kickin that real shit that you fantasize
Niggaz step aside or recognize
G. the real cat, pack the steel cat, baby feel that
Leave you layin flat witcha shit clapped and peeled back
Battle-actin rap shit'll put you in back of a Cadillac
A bad decision; fuck up your whole vision like cataracts
Red roses on a dead foe
Layin in wet clothes from head blows
Your whole brain be exposed
Get your body torn out the frame from lead throws
None of my victims ever bled slow
Stiff as Edgar Poe, that's how it go

Every criminal mug be  living in luxury  what the fuck G?
That must be Bugsy  in the black tux over there with Lucky
Bring my heater  niggaz might try to slug me
Take me out in back of the club and buck me  and touch me
I felt a hand tug me then turnin around I peeped the lovely
Fly face  fat ass gave me a glass of bubbly  said
""Compliments of Bugsy "" then took me across the persian rug to plug me
He shook my hand and hugged me; thought he would do me ugly
but he dug me, pockets chubby said, ""Nino where them drugs be?""
Over there by the derby, buy they dirty devils from me
to keep my paper sturdy, yo word G
I ain't afraid to get my hands dirty, you heard me?
I be D and fuck all that living thirsty, so Nino
do his out in Jersey, showin no mercy, with Frank Nitty
who else and, some nigga with a Babyface that they called Nelson
Bad for your health, Machine Gun Kell' and your Dillinger
Death messenger, known to carry the six cylinder
Look for my army, fatigues to Giorgio Armani's
Holdin the Tommy, no one can harm me; Will and Tommy
tried to alarm me and quote, he turned to smoked salami
Dead as a motherfuckin zombie, full of my ammo
With Bugs Mirando, against the grain so, gotta send him
over the rainbow, he must be brain slow, caught him down
at the train po' in Santo Domingo, left him for dead
Two bullets in his Tango, like how that movie Shane go
Frank Costello, hostile fellow, he murders while remainin mellow
but most of the niggaz on his team was yellow
Cold blooded veins flowin with red Jell-o
There's Joe Adonis, had mad dramas, won't hesitate
to put you in pajamas, fly hooker fine as the Pocahontas
Beauty queen you'll wanta pok-her-hiendas
Frank broke a promise between the organized crimers and old timers
Costello gotta go six below, nobody voted no
to veto, so they hit him with a hollow torpedo
Up in his torso, he ain't a boss so, he can go
without ever lettin the whole police force know
Lex Diamond was scheamin on Capone's scroll
Wanted to own his whole zone, it leaked out
They shot him at a pay phone
with the big chrome, his whole wig blown
Blood flowin from out his flesh and bones
At the wake at the funeral home it's havoc
Family got hit up with automatics
Non-stop static inside the rackets
Jack McGern was burnin split Joe Adonis cabbage
The underworld was goin savage
Pretty Boy Floyd was non-void, unemployed, he destroyed shit
with the Infamous click, wasn't to be toyed with
Mad jealous of all the liquor sellers
Shinin with wine cellars, turn em from hood dwellers to Goodfellas
Me and Nitty was like bank tellers, nothin niggaz could tell us
We drove all over, I pushed a shiny yellow Testarossa
Moved on it closer get the toaster
Started to feel like death was closer, I hit Capone hard
Murder him and his bodyguard in they car and dust the chaffeur
Beef over, I blew him like a supernova
Niggaz nicknamed me, The Black Cobra
The Lady Casanova, yo I'm even deadly when I'm sober
Act like you got a chip on your shoulder
And blast the two right through your boulder
Money you didn't know they shoulda told ya
Nigga you fuckin with a soldier, wake up and smell the Folgers
Niggaz out here done lie in piss to cover up the odor
Operations from here to Minnesota to Dakota
But yo here comes Greasy Thumbs, who wants to get the easy funds
He whispered in my eardrum
""Let's take over the entire city, and split the dough
Me you and Frank Nitty and Siegel and that'll make the bank pretty""
No doubt before we go we gotta murder John Torre
Yo get all his territory dough and end the story yo

Last night  got caught in a gunfight  I think it was like
four niggaz clutchin they burners and bustin
but only could see one in sight
The one on my right  yo son he like we both got gripe
He wanted my life  come at a nigga
with a gun and a knife
He tryin to make the wiped out nigga layin up under the white
But I ain't tryin to go up in no dark tunnel
and burn to the light
And let myself be one more nigga that just got spun in the night
And done in on sight, and tryin to breathe
with one in my pipe
But I'm not one of the type, and I'd rather lose all hung on the mic
Than to be up in the yard receivin CPR
at one in the night
Now I can run and take fllght, but alright, yo son'll be hyped
And I've played mother nature before
so yo I'm clappin thunder tonight
I step right, inside of the street light, my gun it was bright
Send him to kiss Christ, and let my shit slice
in front of him twice
Let one splice, cause fuckin with price, ain't tryin to be nice
I want him on ice, no back home
to a son and a wife
He tried roll dice with real life and got his buns in a vice
Nigga was all enticed to lead his life sheist
but none of it's nice
I peeped shit, and seen his whole click, was runnin in fright
instead of comin to fight, get someone to fight
you son of a dykes
With one in the pipe, I'm aimin to light the one on the right
They all deceased, so yo my asspiece
get hunted for life
Four niggaz cut down, and I can receive one hundred to life
up in a jailcell, that's crawlin with lice
and runnin with mice
Live trife, fillin appetities with nothin but rice
Slow biz and no kid's nigs
start runnin my wife
Only got one life, yo get this fuckin, gun outta my sight
Back at the house, after midnight
I'm done for the night

I'm burnin yo' ass like syphillis
A fast brother you're just a lover with a sore hand
I freeze MC's as if Frosty the Snowman
No man withstands the pain I bring
So face a hellraise of cut, like a laser
Polo plays a part, inside the arts, I grab charts
Start to break you apart, so get smart
You cry for help, knowin you felt, the rhyme
makin the track melt, Polo drops like a black belt
MC's are grounded, pounded down, astound
They rounded up, pounds of sounds, but I drowned them
Surround to check the tape, and play when rate too great
Related too late, I demonstrate fate
I'm fast and, passin the stage of an assassin
Massacre, in a mash I start blastin
Fury article, periodicial
Blowin up all the cools and molecules, here read the articles
Everytime I build the plan and killed the man
MC's got smoked without a filter and
skunked them up like marijuana
Terminator of data and your rhymes is Sarah Conner
You can't rip out, rap up, slip up, slap up
Cause you're trapped up, to get capped up
Play the back of dis here scenery
You clowns'll get broke down like machinery
I bring trouble on the double, bust you like a bubble
Hardrocks get crushed into rubble
The gates of hell open wide to scope in
And I'm hopin, you're brought to the Pope and
the holy bible when you made your arrival
Now the name of the game is survival
The result isn't real difficult to strategy
I'm _Stayin Alive_ like John Travolta
My rhymes are gettin hotter, I gotta
round to allow clowns like a Globetrotter
So I'ma give you the hell that you brought me in
I'm a king with the sting of a scorpion
I just follow your footprint, trace track and blackout
You better shout to get a rap out
What I arrange invented, it's strange demented
The range, be changed when I entered
a stage of furious rage when I had this madness
badness, you felt sadness
Raps are brave and outrageous; all those
chicken rhymes you written should be put in the Yellow Pages
I stand tall, play the wall, and watch dem brain stall
and wet yo' ass like rainfall
I think you need a replacement, you're illin
Call that buildin boy, you're still in the basement
A brain cell swells to jam like a pelican
Fresh out of breath, death left you a skeleton
I'm gonna need your full cooperation
This is a matter of life and death operation
To ease a man in the siege of surgery
of bein done without anesthesia
Go slow, hell no, I let the beat kick
And I get wicked like the Witches of Eastwick
I'm not soft, I kill suckers off
Disarmin it, bombim it, off in a coffin
You get struck, and just like a motherfuckin duck
and plucked and shit out of luck and fucked
Designated to self-destruct
Knocked around like a hockey puck
K-double-O-L-G-R-A-P, N-O M-C plays me
You wish your name had a G but to be
a badder G boy you gotta play with strategy
Top rankin, thinkin ability, memory bankin
But instead you're just sinkin
I attack like a pack of whacked out maniacs

For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips
Leavin niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips

Shots repeatin, leavin faggot niggaz leakin
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin, marchin to Zion

Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin mad noise, a bad boy
When I was younger always carried guns, I never had toys

on niggaz foreheads to makin motherfuckers indian
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder
cause I put holes in my beef like fuckin White Castle burgers
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo'-pound
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down
I see em, he's comin out the fuckin coliseum
and hopped into a BM, shit!
Put in my clip and then I dipped into the ride that my man had
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide
I'm rainin on him (faster nigga) oh yeah we're gainin on him
(oh shit he's with somebody else) fukkit, put his brain on him
Boom boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin up a cigarette
Bang bang, I left the other nigga wet

Went from a small chimp in the game to gorilla king pimpin the game

Limp with a cane, lactosin limp for the king
We even pack toast expend from the flames, my aim
Strictly about makin that bread pop (y'know) blocks red hot
from feds and cops, lookin for rock bottles with red tops
Tradin lead shots with dreadlocks
Infrared dots 'til their head drop, we fled spots
Word on the curb is when it came to birds we spread flocks (no doubt)
No tellin when the bloodshed stop, glide 'til the sled stop
Copped the latest every hot flavor in them crocs and gators

Skylights up in the ceilings for the plants to bloom
Nigga we crop grams in dunes, Cuban cigar brand of grandest fumes
Prison niggaz that ran balloons
Shut down shop from Jan. to June, and still cop land in the boons
Fuck women in tanning rooms
Every last fingernail on their hand groomed, self built do
Down to the mink pelts, gator belts and silk suit
If I can't stack a nigga cap get peeled loose
Word to them cats that died on the street, it's spilled juice
So where that Don be? (right here) In the calm breeze in the palm trees

How big your blanks be  ain't nothin scot free
I'm ready to cop three  talk to me papi

Call off your Rockies
Yo pap they cockin back the glocksies
Pap had to stop three, two sombreros ready to

Bread in their fingertips

from out of the V-6, yeah mami like peep this
Yeah you got that sweetness
This ebony G's to bust open
One of the bastard get the heavenly freeze
I'm runnin with these
Yo hasta luego, amigos
And up and away we go
before they decide to bring the beef burritos
While they count the Fritos

Big bag of the megalitos, three whole kilos
Spot about four vitos
with bullet belts filled up with torpedos
I'm leavin niggaz tore meat though when I draw heat yo
Tryin to leave me dead in the street yo
Mami ?? con tigo
Showdown at sunset, I'm leavin one wet
Slowly I step, my head sweats, my hand on my Tec
I die for my respect, let the slugs and bodies connect
All for the wreck, gotta support my rep on the set
Tekilla Sunrise, my two wives, decides who lives or dies
Leavin my rivals, flat on they back facin the sky
From out the left, took your last breath, death in disguise
With open eyes you dead in the desert, Tekilla Sunrise
I'm cockin on low, ready to hurt foes on dirt roads
Makin my hand jerk from every burst I gave the first blow
Keepin alert though, givin em red glows, givin they shirt holes
Three birds'll blow up in the back seat, I swear to God fuck
she could've been a model, Coke bottle figure, instead
she bent it just like a Desperado, left her hair hollow
Two slugs to swallow -- whose next to follow?
Some cats behind some cactuses
Clappin hazardous, who these niggaz is with low shot averages
Bustin right back at they cabbages, givin em flashbacks
of baby carriages, this mexican inside this Lex is
tryin to crash my shit, drivin reckless
Look like he desperate
Pulled down the tinted glass and let the Tec spit
It's hectic, car flew in bodega with his neck hit
Body and head was seperate, totally disconnected
Bust back two shots
at ones that standin with cannons up on the rooftops
that drew glocks, but my 20/20 spot em for two blocks
I'm wettin shit like it's rainfall they doin dew drops
Two more shots came out saloon doors
I'm blowin shit up like platoon wars
Hesitations I got no room for
Assume sure, the head honcho was bullet wounds bored
Out in the dusty sand, gun was still in his hand
Kicked the can when shit hit the fan
Fuckin around with this G Rap the Hitman

[Kool G. Rap]
From the street blocks, to c-blocks, sleep in a box
Creep with an ox, got beef in the shop, got beef with the cops
Sharp blade keep in the crotch, prison guards deep on the watch
Fifth stare people'll drop, if it ease not then we peeping it pops
Even though they not speaking a lot,
the plot ease drop, greasing a cop
Come to shove meat in your chops, flee the spot, sheets in a knot
Get tied from your feet to the top, you caught in the hall,
make blood skeet with a mop
If you doing shift in the kitchen blood'll leak in the pot,
Just a long game of sheep and the fox
Phone time, beef for your slot, the shit'll make you weep in your coot
Mayors get messy y'all, nigga get shanked up in the chest he fall
Pressed against the wall, got the best of y'all,
stitch from neck to balls
Skin cut flesh and all, stretched out unless you balled,
nothing sexy at all
The life destiny wall, hope the Lord bless when he call,
Stand like a man or be a Debbie in core, heavier
they come heavier from nigga to whore
Be a predator, dead in the morgue, a spread in the log

You got taxes, politics, jobs death
Gross stun it, cold blooded, dark and heartless
From the pyramids down to the projects

What do it take, vandal try to escape
I got a homemade shank, wrap the handle with tape
Better move quick fast, I got a trick for your ass
Niggas in my clique stick dick to your ass
So we don't give a fuck trying to make time past
Here eat it up feed a nigga fine glass
Got jail house wine in the stash,
Every time the café serve swine yo I tell I pass
Do like Beecher did to Shillinger and shit on your ass
You the feature when I'm killing ya, hit on your ass
Supreme Allah said we got time to kill
So when it's time to kill, we got time to kill
In the yard with the guards when its time to build
And time is hard got to use my wills
See shit has changed every since they killed Adebisi
You never know niggas might try to grease me
(Chorus)
[Talib Kweli]
The image that we pro-ject is still God
Time to reflect but the reflection is hard
Like sticking mirrors out between the bars, seeing the guards
Seem like everybody innocent regardless of the charge
You face death, rape threats, and place bets,
on who getting laced next
Forever faceless never waste breathe
Blowing out the candles that the wind already snuffed out
They locked up your body your mind could bust out
Police don't sweep to get the dust out
They want your name in the system,
My need to mention the death penalty as legal lynching
People listen, they got teenagers up in the line up
To fill the new facility they built they need the crime up
Please, the war on drugs is really war on the youth
War on the people, war on the truth
The violent crimes rise,
the silent dies as sirens cry through the night
People fight for what's left and not what's right

I burn while the tables turn like windmills
A swift reactor rap, to impact up the track ?
I flow like a sailor
Rhymes remain hittin hard like Nighttrain
With lyrics that came from the brain of Mark Twain
So if you can't handle the man please go and change the channel
Rappers are gettin smoked like Camels
To weather the brainstorm, fellas better grab your umbrellas
People run inside the cellars
As I teach you're attached to my rhyme like a leash
Takin the S off my speech to fight peach
Take the P off the peach because now you want each
and every rhyme to teach and reach
You need a fixin, for your fake rhymes lyrics and weak mixin
You robbin em blind like Nixon
Some got shook when they took a look
I'm burnin you up, like the lyrics that are pages of a cookbook
I attract more kids than Wonderama
Rhymes got more drama, than black momma white momma
You get defeated decapitated captivated
Cause you hated the fact G. Rap made it
So if you slow you blow like a hoe, so here's a solo
Aiyyo, play it again Polo
Here's a fellow, sayin hello, Polo, mellow
P-O-L-O, shake em like Jell-o
Sonny you're funny like Johnny Carson
So I'ma enjoy, watchin your butt burn up just like an arson
These rhymes here can kill son
You try to rips it just call me the ? Flip Wilson
And rhymes I got em down pat
Release this hit like the Superfly soundtrack
Too dope of a type windpipe full of hype
and I sideswipe the suckers I snipe
The mic so hot, it can weld when it's hell
and assassinate, like Lee Harvey Os-wald
Rough on the radio, Sony or Sanyo
Rappers get slayed and played like a banjo
When I illustrate, stiller rhymers is iller
Battle me, you better swallow a bottle of painkillers
I go faster and faster, skills of a Grandmaster
Makin you fall like plaster
Amazed, grammar plays like gamma rays
Chumps are caught in the blaze and dumped in ashtrays
You pussy willow, I can see your sihlouette
You're scared, and tears of fear made your pillow wet
You wanna tic-tac-toe with a big rap pro?
Yo, play it again Polo
Guys are weary, eyes be teary, survived and leary
Your rhymes are eerie, that's my theory
I'm here to jam and slam like Bam-Bam
Damn, Polo play it again like Sam
Cuts in harmony, you ain't harmin me
Your beats are moist and your sweet voice is charmin me
Not flexible, your style needs to be twisted
Plus your name's unlisted
Rhymes are tough like gristle, watch the boy sizzle
Your brainstorms don't even drizzle
But my brainstorms gives lots of pain, lots of rain
Long spins, the strong winds of a hurricane
You get sunken when I hit a punk and
rag a fag, makin him stagger like he drunken
You can't stop treatin my hip-hop
like a Blo Pop, chew up the slop like a gumdrop
Makin you sweat like a death threat, slow when I flow
I'ma let, Polo wet up the whole set
Yes the final, death wish to sucker MC's
gets granted, with rhymes makin em stand planted
I start blowin blows, and my rhymes are like a bolo
So hey, play it again Polo

I play it Kool, gettin to tour just like a jazz player
Your record player ain't nothin without the funky rhyme sayer
Kool G. Rap, cause to the little I'm an idol
Attackin the vital parts to maintain my title
The suckers panic, but to the ladies I'm romantic
and gigantic, just like the Atlantic ocean
as I flow in slow motion
And I be cookin you suckers like tan lotion
The K-double-O-L, G-R-A-P, and P-O-L-O
would like to say hello to you mellow fellow
What are you yellow? You're hidin like a coward
And I don't allow it, you get devoured
Cause you can't cope, cause I'm dope and you don't have
a prescription, so just walk like an Egyptian
My instrumentals ain't up for rental
But come and try em and if you wanna buy em then I supply em
I got the source of an orchestra
But if you don't pay the cost to the boss then I'm forcin ya
You said you're ready like Freddie to battle me
But the real Freddie's Dead and I ain't Curtis Mayfield
All wise, with four I's/eyes like Mississippi
You try to trip me, but I just play it Kool
just like a hippie, to be like G, this is the number one rule
Play it Kool

I just glide, these are the tales from the brainside
With lyrics and the beats I provide they collide
to form a homicide, you get dragged in a big bag
Shell ? ricochet, so watch em zig-zag
off angle, but I'm in shape like a triangle
I need a sucker to strangle, with my new single
All rhymes are terrifying, you're dying
You might as well be in a cage with a mountain lion
When I hear the bell ring, I'm swingin head level
Burnin your block, my rhymes hotter than Red Devil
So peel off, like a potato (""Cool"")
Cause I play it Kool like the music inside a elevator
Doc the Butcher is a true blue musician
I'm gettin busy while suckers are goin fishin
or out to lunch, as they munch and they crunch
on a bunch of stellar rhymes, so I just give em a Hawaiian Punch
and let em stagger, givin em lipstick and they Mick Jagger
Lyrics are sharper than a dagger
Agony, yeah I'm braggin nobody's baggin me
To the bedroom, your girlfriend is draggin me
I make the hits radios won't swing, but that's OK (""Cool"")
Hey, cause everything is still Kool and the Gang (""Cool"")

but I play it Kool

I play it Kool, makin you kneel, squirm and squeel
My name ain't Rodney but I'm standin on the Dangerfield
And my shows, I bust em out just like a virgin
Cause I get stupid but I'm smarter than a brain surgeon
G. Rap is here to bury
So duck MC's, I send em to the Pet Semetary
Your whole crew turns chicken when they finish
watchin you die, so please stand by as I fry
You kinda sour so I dip you in some flour
Read my book, it says cook for about an hour
Ring the dinner bell, brain cells are well done
It's time you got a story, don't tell none
So this here is the only I'm sane
so play it Kool (""Cool) or you'll be headin for the deadpool
I play it Kool-er than a band in the North Pole
But I never freeze up or catch a cold
Never stiff, I shoot the gift kinda swift
Try to riff, and you'll needin a facelift
Cause I'm a teacher and a trainer, a preacher and a explainer
World's greatest entertainer
I approach like a coach to the umpire
And like live wire I'ma start a dumb fire
This is Kool G. Rap the Principal of the new school
cause I play it Kool

Since I made the record ""Talk Like Sex ""
bitches are comin' up with their friends for a nigga to hit the skins.
Hopin' the Kool G Rap was just makin' rhymes
but I'm leavin' bitches' vaginas with more stitches than Frankenstein.
Some even had the nerve to try to give me head
and swallow the whole jimmy to make a nigga fed.
But come on you bitches, don't make me laugh;
you couldn't deep throat G Rap if you was a motherfuckin' giraffe.
Dag, some even fled when they saw the head,
cuz G's dick would make you seasick fuckin' me in a waterbed.
Don't try to paly me like no sucker,
cuz these bitches'll be callin' up Dial-a-Mattress like a motherfucker.
You heard the song before; you don't wanna see me,
""I'll fuck you on the A-train while I write graffiti.""
I'll even fuck you in a taxi cab,
and after sex with a nigga you'll be buyin' a box of maxi-pads.
Soon as you open your legs,
no need for no birth control, bitch, cuz my dick is touchin' the eggs.
Kool G Rap, the pussy slammer;
hell, I'd be talkin' fucked up grammar if you was Bad Mamma Jamma.
I ain't small, I'll have you cummin' like waterfalls,
and then turn them sugar walls into Carnegie Hall.
Leavin' my mark on bitches like Zorro,
plus fuckin' bitches so def like there won't be no pussy left tomorrow.
Hittin' hoes like it ain't funny,
I think about bowls of Cheerios because I want my nuts and honey.
Talkin' to all the women that look fine,
pretendin' my prick was Moby Dick and have a whale of a time.
Now I'm not a deep-sea diver,
but I love it when my dick's covered and smothered with saliva.
Shit, might even straighten out your dentures,
because it's not just a blow job, honey, it's an adventure.
But 69, and I ain't with that:
I'll go to a Chinese restaurant, bitch, if I wanna eat cats.
Because you gotta be brave to eat the tuna, G.
So when it comes to pussy-lickin', I'm the chicken of the sea.
I should be on the sex channel;
not a chump cuz I'm givin' punk-bitches better humps than camels.
If you're a virgin, I'll make it fit,
because my dick'll pop the cherry and spit out the fuckin' pit.
And if you're concerned, my sperm don't burn,
and if it did, I'd give that nappy-headed ass a fuckin' perm.
Shucks, I instruct a fuckin' lesson.
You think it's painless? I hit the anus and fuck up your large intestines.
Leavin' you bitches stingin' from the bangin';
my man Jimmy got a hole in his head, but yo, that nigga's still hangin'.
Bitch, you'd rather hump a fuckin' whole army,
cuz even the Witness Protection Program couldn't hide this man's salami.
You fuck around and catch a seizure,
before I fuck a hoe I gots ta put the hooker under anesthesia.
Lettin' saliva dribble on your nipple,
orgasms double and triple sit ripple and turn your ass into a gripple.
Then I see you searchin' for the swellin',
cuz I'm-a leave a hole so big your gynecologist might fall the hell in.
Got damn! I hit the ham right;
honeybuns, you can ask my Three Sons, I got the Dick right out the Van Dyke.
I'm fuckin' naked girls with fly rhymes,
but don't push me, because that pussy will be runnin' for it's nine lives.
I know you hookers can't refuse this,
but dont' pick me to give no hickeys cuz I'm givin' bitches bruises.
Yeah, I'll tear that pussy hole apart,
for fuckin' with G Rap after dark, you'd rather jog in Central Park.
So if you want kids before I fuck ya,
look at the size of my dick, and you'll let out the motherfuckers.
Shit, bitches get open like a can;
just leave it up to G Rap, cuz I'm the neighborhood Fuck U Man...

Niggaz wanna flip - THEN WE TAKE EM TO WAR
Break a nigga proper - THEN WE BREAK HIM SOME MORE
[Grimm]
I represent the murderers and felony offenders
who either bought time out, to get these legal tenders
(Surrender!) Nah, I'm goin out with a bang nigga
FUCK PATAKI, I gotta do my thang nigga
Forty-four mag, bustin into action
Brains left in particles, fragments and fractions
Grimm, the money stacker, heat packer
I'm lurkin, I'm waitin, attackin like a linebacker
Fuck what you heard, crime pays
and always, unorthodox, I hold my pistol sideways
We kill crews, hearts go numb
and if retaliation comes then yo fuck it, it just comes
(Yo who you?) I'm Dr. Death motherfucker ever heard of me?
Close your eyes, cross your fingers, time for surgery
I'm already dead, so nah, you can't murder me
cause quantities of entities enter me evilly
Chorus: repeat 2X
[B1]
Since I murder for hire, rapid fire's what I require
Makin niggaz perspire, so send a message through the wire
cause violence is contagious, it got me bustin gauges
The '95 Larry Davis and I'm wettin niggaz for wages
Queens is the home of 1, the known felon
and ain't no tellin, when I'ma crack your fuckin melon
For the right amount of chips, I spit clips and hit whips
Leavin niggaz bloody, the leather seats is where the shit drips
with the pound-seven, I be creepin, rockin niggaz while they sleepin
Shots repeatin, leavin faggot niggaz leakin
When I cock back the iron, niggaz is dyin, marchin to Zion
cause the pound-cake, roars like a lion
Word son, niggaz be collapsin, cause my weapons is
ready for action, makin your heart catch contractions
In the underworld, shootin gallery niggaz lose calories
cause my salary's based on fatalities
Chorus: repeat 2X

Here I come to get some motherfuckin wreck but first I gotta
umm vest check, uncheck, clip one check, clip two check, I'm set
So let a motherfucker move a muscle
When I tussle they'll be piecin niggaz back like fuckin puzzles
Cause Kool G. Rap is known for bringin mad noise, a bad boy
When I was younger always carried guns, I never had toys
Grimm, gimme the infrared they see me and I'm puttin red dots
on niggaz foreheads to makin motherfuckers indian
You got beef? Go get yourself a wreath, because it's murder
cause I put holes in my beef like fuckin White Castle burgers
So now I gots to run up on a clown with the fo'-pound
Cock back, rock black, gun a nigga down
I see em, he's comin out the fuckin coliseum
and hopped into a BM, shit!
Put in my clip and then I dipped into the ride that my man had
Parked on the sidewalk, then we start to glide
I'm rainin on him (faster nigga) oh yeah we're gainin on him
(oh shit he's with somebody else) fukkit, put his brain on him
Boom boom, no survivors, lifted the nigga out his seat
When they find him, he'll be a backseat driver
But I ain't finished with the trigger yet, I'm lightin up a cigarette
Bang bang, I left the other nigga wet
It's G. Rap baby, you know me, you try to hurt this
I split your fuckin top and leave a fingerprint on purpose!

Don't know who is this kid, you better check the formula
Before I have to send these busters, just to warm you up
Man, Homicide be looking for whoever tore you up
Flood up the whole block with paramedics and coroners
I can roll up all by myself and make a street close
Yo you could be twenty deep and still get your feet rose
Believe me, ain't none of them running up when heat blow
You sleep though, you're whole sweet and low
Free to go, deeper than six feet low
This wiseguy's enterprise, we emphasize who ever die
Never sympathize, still on the rise, no matter how many we minimize
we send ? chicks with bricks inside their inner thighs
Some real thugs conduct the drug traffic in the skies
Never high, we lay low, stay unidentified, it's all live

Yo it's the radical, mathematical, fanatical
Magnifico, money making myth in Mexico
You try to fuck me, yo, I'll bust you in your cherry whole
Still run the streets and now you feeling me in stereo
I felt the graces from the highs to the very low
One day your counting money, next yo you digging holes
Don't try to do this at home, this is professionals
Congressionals, street medal, award winners
Making a point that's hollow, do you follow, wanna meet tomorrow?
What, greet the heffer with the pink pucker, sucker
Cut out your luck with a wink of an eye
Make ya die, make ya fly in the sky, you asking why?
While your souls floating over me, you owing me
You shouldn't been owing me, not blowing me
Now your life's a big mystery, a casualty
Another faded memory, that's awful Bee
Cuz I'm still breathing steadily
[Pokaface]
You think that Pokaface is bluffing, nigga ante up
And unless you ramming me with that iron, put your jammie up
You pointedly regret, I'll blaze you and your family up
You on your ass for showing trying to show it, pull your panties up
Me and these cats we making a living making sure you don't
Information's not to be given, making sure you won't
Shit's real, now wanting to be dead, goes off in play it clothes
ATF here, but scared to get close, like in WACO
Nickel plate pros made men who make those
My red eye don't ? but best believe it shakes those
Reflex reaction if i hear you disrespect the fashion
Fuck these niggas, like menage, giving them double action
Up to no good fellas, making out a faux pas
Savage niggas, turn your cabbage into cole slaw
Using my dome, causes to notify your next of kin
The snitch you looking for, he's in the trunk I left him in
[Chorus]
Strictly for all the chicks that's on the strip to get loot
For all my niggas that don't ever trip to hit ?
For all my people copping bricks to get the quick loot
For all my niggas in the ground that got their wig blew

Slinging them pies where they lust at
Or corners where they hang most

Drive with the thing close
Slide with a James post
Empty clips is on now
Coke fiends are strung out
Broke niggas bum out
Jakes holdin they gun out
When back streets are taped up
Bodies laying faced up
Cats running with ace up
The spots get 'em paced up
The street lamps are broke now
Mad bitches to bone now
When niggas peep your home out
And flip when they zoned out
Thugs bringing the street war
Bust shots let the heat roar
Taking trips to be more
With bricks up in to fiend off
The towns where they spray shit
Bust rounds and lay shit
Selling pounds' a great shit
And clowns get their face-lift
Spots where gats pop off
Shots clear the block off
Slugs knock your block off
And have you licking hot sauce
(Chorus)
On the corners where the dice roll
And clubs where the ice glow
The lames get their life stole
And bleed from a knife fold
Niggas laying they law down
Some draw with a four-pound
PJ's are tore down
Thoughts of laying hos down (The streets)
Blocks where they lick shots
And rock what the fifth cocked
Kids cop the six drop
From brick box and zip locks
Towns where niggas kill at
Posting where it's real at
Keeping gats concealed at
See a foe you peel at
Strip where you get ripped off
Hot lead get licked off
Fronting and your clicks off
All your jewels get stripped off
Sidewalks where they creep up
Get locked up with a street bop
Kids running with heats up
Lifting both of your feets up
Niggas they let their guns loose
They wild guns loose
Gat up under the chin
Blow a niggas shit through the sunroof
Decide where they pack nines
The chrome gat shines
You try to clap mine
You outta line niggas get flat lined
(Chorus)
Now Chickens a get your crew laced
For rocks and a blue face
Niggas giving they screwface
For the loot and the suitcase
Spots that blood spills on
And dealers clock a 'mil on
Murderers get their kill on
Mad cash is ill-on
Beef turning to combat
For life so they pump gats
Little kids they harm that
Put bombs where your moms at
Niggas tied up and kidnapped
And smacked up with big gats
Get found with they wig cracked
Leave 'em right where they live at (The streets)
Running for red beams
Blood flowing in red streets
Mad fellas with bread schemes
Running from the FED team
Little shorties are knocked up
Straight giving their crouch up
Juveniles decide to pee now with they ox up
Crack blocks and weed spots
The fiends up in the Detox
Some rollin in three drops
Others aint gotta beep bop
Bitches that get their hoe on
Smoke dope on and so on
Spotted nigga with glow on
With dick they could blow on

You know how we do
Y'all know how a nigga bring it
Straight direct at you kid
Like a Don from out of Sicily; under the arm is where the pistol be
Top of your forehead, the kiss'll be
planted ever so soft and gentle but die viciously
Hours of torture, before the torture apply misery
Days before I feel pity to give a guy liberty
Seen him, his pants shitty and eyes all glittery
I'll die a rich man before the FBI figure me
40 stories up, inside a high rise in Italy
No hidden forces, only natural courses deliver me
Gray hairs from the great years, fears never shiver me
Reminscin, how we car-bombed ignitions
of politicians, judges strong-armed to listen
Men turnin up dead, or hurt harmed and missin
Bulletproof cars are driven, Teflon edition
Bodies cut up in large chunks, thrown in car trunks
Music inside the bar stunk
Gettin surrounded by bitches blowin cigars drunk
One of my stonefaced goons'll make your heart pump
Electrocution with cables that make the car jump
The yard punks, that sinned with a life sentence for sellin hard junk
The family, the whole commission
Has been around since the days before prohibition (no doubt)
Mathematics was good then, the slow addition
Some overdosed down a coke slope, a dope addicition
Lookin back on them days, I ran a whole division
Some of the Jake and the state was tryin to throw the mission
They caught a ticket ride to hell with no admission; beyond these tracks

Curtains and drapes, got these Jakes tryin to can me for real
Until then, be in the backyard with clam on the grill
Or catch me laid up in the canope ill
With two mamis handin me thrills; Vivica Fox body Vanity grills
Rubberbandin these bills; tryin to duck the fame and the glamour
Tryin to stay from out the range of the scanners
Not tryin to get my frame in the camera
Avoid tabloids and front pages
Bums get knocked off and bumped for favors
Collect Trump papers with pumps and gauges
Royale suites when I bunk in Vegas
Got homicide searchin the city dump for neighbors
Pinky ring with a chunk of glacier
Copped a spot with a bunch of acres
Some of them got they bodies slumped for capers
Barcaleno hat, ducks and gators
Got a crib full of housemaids, butlers and waiters

Word, Y'all know what it's about
Strictly about the big things, know what I'm sayin'
Big money, big cribs, know what I'm sayin'
Bitches with big asses, word up
Big chains and shit, know what I'm sayin'
Everything big kid think big, know what I mean
Big Guns and all that, y'all niggaz is big time dick suckers tho'

I'm thug for life, ain't no changin me
I'm thug for life, ain't no changin me
I pop off guns and live dangerously
I'm lot more nigga than you aimin to be
My Range bling, platty chain hang to the knee
I'm thug for life, ain't no changin me
[Verse One]
Aiyyo, who got the drop, my gun been cocked
Spits from four-fives to flintlocks, pinky finger with the pimp rock
Hustle on dim blocks and sip Henn-rock
Draw quick, got a second hand like Big Ben clock (ya heard?)
Reach for that heat, put your wig in the wind pop
Fill your belly with ten shots; if I get hit
and you see blood then flood the bullet wound with gin shots
Put beef in a Slim Jim box
Bitch you wanna pinch and win slot
Clap lead until your big friend drop
Niggaz'll front until I send chin shots
Beat the rock until they send cops (or what?)
'Til one of us'll get carried out on the thin cot
Emergency room skin chopped by ten docs
Got it locked like a bid in the state pen box
When I dares peers hangin to where my shin stop; before I struck rich
Fucked bitches and killed 'em with a ten inch cock (f'real)
Bitch nigga stuck him with a ten inch ock (y'know?)
Bread bloods and stiff vodka, deep in this game
Know the feds want the clique locked up
We love brain so we headhunt like witchdoctors
My lil' momma let lead dump from big poppa
Even the Jake surrounded the spread with pig choppers
that taste preposterous; tear gas, tanks of oxygen
Like we in banks with hostages (what we want?)
All we want is minks and ostriches (what?)
Diamond cuff links and proper shit
Snitches left stinkin in carpet stiff
Or get they carcasses turned to link sausages (f'real)
Ain't nuttin sweet, we known for bangin cartridges
We got the heart for this
No matter how light or dark it is (ya heard?)
(No matter how light or dark it is, f'real)
Thug for life (what?) Rep by strips (killers)
Let loose clips (dealers) Stack mad chips (you know we)
Bag bad chicks (my niggaz) Push fly whips (all of the)
Hoes blow dick (nigga) G flows sick (what?)
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
My whole life about chrome rims and stone gems (what?)
Big boned skins, Capone brims, dick blown in my own Benz
Quick to Scarface thugs who raise up blown brims
Dolla trickin never politickin with grown mens
Ideas of settin me up for loot I won't bend
Just make that light bulb at the top of your dome dim (uh-huh)
Who rap-happy nigga keep the lyrics and poems grim
Get found at the bottom of the river with stone Timbs (word)
Babyface, swimmin flash stomach and toned limbs
Wake up every mornin work out in the home gym
Reppin this rap game until my zone ends (uh-huh)
'Til mixin boards melt down, the microphone bend (yea)
I spit about street shit but never condone sin
Kept it thug for life baby followed my own trend
[Chorus]
Kid!!  Word.. thug shit
Queens shit for life nigga

And really think  we don't know who they are!
""Now that's funky"" (4X)

Crime don't pay  that's what they tell us
But that's because the other motherfuckers gettin jealous
But I'ma tell you this  they neighborhood got the Goodfellas
But they come arrest us for the same shit they sell us
Cause they don't want to see a young black nigga rollin
inside a nice car, nice kit, without the shit bein stolen
So they come and lock a nigga up
Meanwhile some corrupt, politician nigga is makin bigger bucks
Niggaz gettin blamed for the crystals; but we don't grow
the motherfuckin coke or weed or make the fuckin pistols
Niggaz ain't tryin to live in poverty
And a black man's lottery's a motherfuckin robbery
So yo you gotta make your best
Make a small investment and then put it to the test (""I know!"")
Yes, cause the other motherfuckers gettin over
Police don't look at a WHITE MAN strange drivin a Range Rover
Carrying shit like it's minerals
The big dollar white dollar suit and tie criminals
Even the government figures
Sellin shit to the motherfuckin Columbians and rich niggaz
Crime isn't time from the brothers
Hey you say it don't pay, it's payin white motherfuckers
It all depends on how you do your shit
Cause either learn it quick intelligent and that's it
(""I beg your pardon?"") You're well fittin
FUCK workin for a bastard
I gotta see that money before my ass sees a casket
Get paid, motherfuck a raise
Cause to all them improper crooked coppers, crime pays

""Everybody's got to make a living""
""Boy I'm trying to make me some.. MONEY!!""
[Kool G. Rap]
Stop, nigga stop, nigga freeze
But at the same time, some old rich fuck, is drivin by with twenty ki's
Because they came up with a law
to keep the rich motherfuckers rich and the poor motherfuckers poor
We take the cake you get the crumbs
Stackin up a package of cracks, to sell to blacks in the slums
Guns are bein sold over the counter
And you wonder why your daughter's head was slaughtered when they found her
Why did he have to shoot the bitch
but the bitch I mean the witch just had to switch
to make the nigga Richie Rich
Yeah, so I'm throwin you the phrase
Believe me when I tell you motherfuckin crime pays

Ain't nothin 'round here but drug addiction
Niggas is anti-love-livin
The slug-givin little shortie on the snub itchin
For beef, he might get left in the street with his blood drippin
The poor niggas sling crack, real raw niggas that bang gats
Crazy lady jumped on the train tracks
Know if you owe somebody dough you better bring that
Them kids is live, put five where your brain at
You walk the streets of the slums
Know to spot beef when it come
Reach for the guns or feel the heat from the ones
Never know who your killer be (Yeah, speak to no one)
Just put a Desert Eagle beak in his lung
Leak em and run, some guys light the blunts up
(And then what?) And then go ride with the pumps up
Chopped up bitch inside of a dumpster
Paramedics tryin to speed a nigga pulse up
(Yo, he's a cold blue) victim of the vultures
Block sizzlin hot, flooded in the middle with cops
Innocent nigga topped, riddled with shots
Kids up in rock spots clock knots, fiddle with glocks
Ready to die for what little they got
Tricks, hoes and thugs (That's right)
The ones that put holes in mugs
Waitin outside for them ones that pose in clubs
To that strange nigga knockin on your do' with gloves
Let the .44 blow for grub, it's no love
[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2: Prodigy ]
You got uniformed cops, the D's when it's hot
TNT knockin down the door of your spot
The feds come get you once you think you on top
They just been buildin they case, they got you on tape
The CIA clip you if the shit is that deep
Your money's that long, you ain't that strong
Informants'll bury you under the jail
They got wires and statements for juries to hear
Then they got rivals that got it clickin just like you
That's your competition, them niggas tryin to eat too
They'll set you up for dead if you don't show strength
Extort all your workers cause you ain't built for this
Plus stick-up kids and jealous-ass niggas
You gotta watch your front, sides and your back (Damn)
You gotta keep your eyes on your bitch and your mens
You gotta keep your mind sharp livin so fed

Aiyyo check this
Aiyyo Rob Sutton hit the button!
Hah!  Yeah
You know time is it (3X)
Check it check it check it out yo
Check
I beg your pardon who's the one with the roughness?
Super extra toughness, Grand Pu-ba-la!
See I'm the chosen, I keep the snakes frozen
Check out how I blows in, girl it feels good when it goes in
Here's the situation, supreme motivation
helps me get the loot, and then I knock the boots
I jump high like Jordan, Flash like Gordon
'bos, Girbauds and shorts is probably what I'm sportin
Fuck what you heard, this is what you need to hear
It's the same as last year, so _Step to the Rear_
Cause when I was a shorty couldn't wait to drink my first 40
Find an ex-shorty in the hallway and get naughty
Jump on the elevator, hit the lights out
My moms was a yardie so my pops kept a stout
Ooh a young boy tipsy, that's without a doubt
It wasn't hard to tell what the Puba was about
Love the ladies lovely used to do it on my knees
Certain honey got a problem go see Puba he can ease ya
Here I am, and here I stand
Honey all that good shit tell me, who's the man?
From, here to Bangkok, I sign my John Hancock
on the contract, it's like 1-2-3 Contact
Kick shit on the really cause I do it on the daily
Straight to the hole like my man Malik Seally
I hit stunts, on occasion smoke blunts
My moms don't like me cause I wear gold fronts
If honey wants to flam it's no thing to me at all
Alamo and Stud Doogie, it's time to have a ball
I'm a go-getter, and I'm out to go-get
If you're makin movies, CANCEL that shit
You're still makin movies?  Man, get your corder-cam
Oops, cam-corder, but shit you know the order
Couldn't get no skins, until you got a Benz
Didn't have no friends til you started makin ends
I see it daily, weekly monthly yearly
Think you got it goin on?  Really
I never sold gems to the bums in the slums
Only robbed devils, made a few number runs
Brothers round my way they like to blabber at the gums
Just jealous cause I got it by the tons
Twenty fifty hundred, is how I count my bills
Then I take it slow because it runs into the mills
Brothers try to step to this but all they catch is chills
No frills, Puba pays the bills
Ron Studda spin the wheel back like his name was Pat Sajak
on Wheel of Fortune.. that's how we keep it scorchin
Alamo HEY, Sadat X HEY, Baby Pop HEY, now let me keep it rollin
This is just the way I move to keep my pockets swollen
Lights cameras action here comes Mr. Satisfaction
I be maxin and relaxin til it's time to jump in the action
Now for grown I speak with a tone which I choose to call my own
Ghetto prone I guard the zone like the kid from _Home Alone_
Type of style that flows for days it's like it pays to save amaze
Now I be careful on the lays because the AIDS are nowadayses
Grand Puba, S.O.S., Stud Doogie, Alamo
You know how the shit go!
So Big Jeff HEY, B.R. HEY, Tislam HEY, Ja-El HEY
Stud Doogie HEY, Alamo HEY, and Uptown HEY, Brooklyn HEY
And here we go here we go make the dough yo
Here we go here we go make the dough yo
Now check it y'all I'd like to say peace
to all the Gods and the Earths and the people of the universe
Wanna let you know the black man come first
So don't act up cause you might leave in a hearse
Yo check this yo
I wanna give a big up to all my Now Rule people
You know the flavor, Projects M.O.
Lincoln Ave. M.O., youknowhatI'msayin?
City Park in the dark M.O., youknowhatI'msayin?
Big up big up to all my people
All that other shit .. is dead, dead, DEAD

Verse One:
Here I go with the new style, such a versatile child
Hons crack a smile as the dancers hit the tile
General like Custer, spread skins like mustard
Brothers try to copy but they shit sound busted
or should I say chopped, brothers need to stop
Once Puba shits, you know the joint is grit
More followers than Jehovah, call me Casanova
Used to drive a Nova, but now I push a Rover
Pumpin nuff hits, scoopin mad chicks
A golden brown complexion and you won't find a zit
I take a sip of my brew, before the night is through
Honies askin Pu', ""Can you woo woo woo?""
Yes I got the skills that'll always pay the bills
""My, my, my,"" like Johnny Gill
Quick to knock the block baby all around the clock
Ticky-ticky-tock, ticky-ticky-tock
So don't try to play the Puba (cause ain't nothin happenin)
Don't even waste your time (cause ain't nothin happenin)
Step left with that garbage (cause ain't nothin happenin)
You know why black?  (Why is that?)  Bust it, cause I get

Verse Two:
Follow me now see
Ooh la la la, me say take to dis guy on de natural high
Ooh la la la, me say come follow me, come come now
Ooh la la la, me say take it to dis guy on de natural high
Ooh la la la, me say come follow me, bust it
I caught wreck in a sec with a girl that I met
at this discotheque, now let me recollect
Mmm, the night was lovely, oh so lovely
She still thinks of me
Now I keep my hair peasy, mo' fine and greasy
Never hit the skins if the skins look sleazy
Sweetheart, here goes a hint, you better take a mint
cause I can smell the scent
Now if I smoked a bag of sess, I still wouldn't mess
with a girl in a tight dress, cause a tight dress
just won't impress, but you can try your best
and it still won't matter
Game for a quickie, I can make a sticky
Hold on the hickie, cause next week it's Vicky
Rhyme style fat, the God'll break a back
of a new jack, or old jack, who wants to sweat the sac
Time for the papes so you better drink some coffee
Hon thinks she knows me, but bitch back up off me
Puba, you know my word is bond, peace to the Gods
and I got to move on, cause you know I get
Chorus
Verse Three:
Bust it I'ma drop one more before I travel like sound
Brothers say Puba, I'm happy that you makin it
Then turn around and tell a female some other shit
Sincere, you bear my witness (True indeed)
A nobody in somebody's business
Mind your own neck, and go collect your Mickey D's check
But when you see me give me nuff respect
Sincere Allah how do you think I should take it?
(Let's slide them niggaz down Lincoln butt naked)  Bust it!
I'm not the Captain or the Skipper, got it good behind the zipper
Now if honey wants to flip you know the God'll have to flip her
I won't smack it but I'll flip it and I'll rub it down
Catch a movie and a dinner and then I'm back uptown
I rock beats on the daily really when I'm in the mood
Attitude never screwed, I only eat the righteous food so
cut on the amp and I can show you who's the champ
The man who leaves with all the scamps cause I gets over

Usually bust records on gettin butt naked

pump the tape, grab your dick, get with the Puba frenzy
C'mon honey sing, don't you, try to eject
_Slow Down_'s what you say, once my joint gets erect

Huh, I'm livin fat, me fall off, there'll be none of that
See who's the one to flip it?  Quick to tell a nigga to zip it
Stud drink the 40 cause we ain't got time to sip it
Grand Puba got body
Kick some of them, some of those, and some yardies
As dope as they come, suckers sing or hum
Don't try to step to this, you know your shit is slum
First batter up well here's the pitch - it's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
The one who arouse, as I browse for a blouse
Kick styles by the piles, as I leave a trail for miles
Skins when I please, hit from here to Tel Aviv

O-kay o-kay o-kay, what more could I say?
Alamo get the boom and.. parlay parlay
I'm far from the average, civilize the savage
When I'm low on protein I'm with the bean soup and cabbage
Skins on the diet, kick the flavor, cause a riot
Do a show and get the dough and then I'm off to the Hyatt
So tie me on the spliff, ain't no ands or if
And if you really wanna riff you just might end up playin stiff
Girbauds hangin baggy, Hilfiger on the top
Knapsack on the back, that's just my flavor Hobbes
As my man gives a zigga zigga, watchin three grow bigga bigga
To Pos K, that's my nigga
Here goes the wreck, whaddayou expect?
If you wanna see some wreck, send cash, not a check
Grand Puba, more than a public figure
Quick to kick the bone up the butt of a golddigger

Call on Grand Puba if you really need a pro

Don't front honey, act like you know
Now big up to my Brooklyn mob (Brooklyn!  Brooklyn!)
Big up to my Uptown mob (Uptown!  Uptown!)

Knowledge Cipher, divided by Power Equals Wisdom
But you know we have to start with Knowledge first
Divine evil's what dispearse in a hearse
Situation that we in, some people sayin that we're cursed
The lack of the knowledge of ourselves makes it worse
Science that we drop, make the average head burst
So do the knowledge on the very next verse
I heard a brother say, ""I wash the clothes, I cook your food
I pay your rent,"" now is that how the story went?
Emphatically no, singer singin that weak wisdom knowledge
Shit Haji God is here to cancel it
So just ring the alarm, another Devil's dying, boooohhh
Just ring the alarm, an Uncle Tom is tryin, boooohhh
I didn't come to conceal it, I come to reveal it
The True and Living God with the son of man (son of man)
And if you ever need assistance just take my hand
Black man be prepared cause here comes the Klan
Now my great great Grand, was hung on a tree
by the colored man -- you probably know him as a white man
I seen a Oprah Winfrey show, she said that was in the past
but [bitch], kiss my [ass]
Now it's time to teach the people, why our people's not
treated equal, here's the next sequel (speak on it God)
Askin taller than the tallest wall, you ever saw
Sincere gave the God a call, we boost it from the mall
Long as it's a Devil I'ma take it
If a Devil catch me right, I leave him buttnaked (yessir yessir)

Now here it go (here we come)

The soul controller (soul controller)

Now wake up, wake up, cause you went back to sleep
Grab ahold of your mental cause this next verse is deep
Now check out the thing and what they did to Rodney King
That goes to show ya, who controls ya
The Devil man when brothers went lootin in Cali
they used the corder-cam, the same as the police man
But I bet my last bottom dollar G
The brothers that they picked up won't go free
See I'm a, disbeliever when it comes to jungle fever
Aiyyo God you trust the Devil?  (Now Cipher)  Me neither
Now brothers say, ""Why you diss the church like Ock?""
Cause if church was good for us, it wouldn't be on every block
of our neighborhood, just like a liquor store, it just ain't
no good -- they represent the ten percent
Now Momma Lova has no loot, but she'll spend her last dime
to make sure her child has an Easter suit
What is this with Christmas, I just can't see
spendin your money, givin the credit
to a fat man comin down your chimney (c'mon)
I just can't see it, it's like TV tellin lies to your vision
Haji God is here to make the incision

Niggas fiend to get in my jeans like the chromosome
Check the sex, the voice ain't baritone
Shit ain't fully grown, drop me off at home
Better yet let cha' tongue roam
Ya options blown so baby stop and where we hop in the zone

Grand Puba flippin' shit for (2000)
Here comes the brotha from the future
Man, I got what suits ya
Fake mc's go away and let your label prostitute ya
Give me my space and let the swinger swing
Nigga don't you know that Jane can't even stop this crazy thang
I like to boast cause i'm the host with the most
Bag a few honeys and i'm... (Space Ghost!!!)
I got niggas head-bobbin' with no problem
I kick 31 flavors so call me Basket Robbins, uhh
I gets down cause i travel like sound
Grand Puba's so fast they got my picture on a Greyhound
Here goes the tizm, get ya lifted like izm
If these devils ain't got my money then i got some off the prison
So honey here's more than a rent
For dollars and sense, see i leave shit bent
So don't even come with that 69, hon
cause i told ya last time, 68 and i owe ya one
back up and let Puba do his thing,
cause a nigga wanna krib like Eddie Murphy had a boomerang
So butt niggas get the steppin'
I gets to the root like beer
Lyrics flow like an automatic weapon
You can't see this or much greater,
rough like Terminator, sendin' niggas down like elevators
So like Beavis and Butthead...(he he he he)
Go away like 94, we drop the Kronkite nigga
Chorus
No shame in the game I puts the pedal to the metal
Be a father to my son, ask the Bulldogs and pedal (?)
Puba gots that shit that hits in every ghetto
Straight from New York, L.A. to ____
Honey, there's no need to hunt
Whatever you want, just make sure when you come you bring a blunt
This is for the year 2-circle-circle-circle
Niggas lookin' stupid like their spotted and they urkel
Did i say that?
Doogie hits the scratch
Niggas can't match, baggin' bootys by the batch
That's how we do at a theatre near you
Do the show, bag the doe and disappear like the zoo
Then i hit home, to rest my dome
Unplug the phone and put a joint on the bone
I kick the style longtime ya know
Niggas can't see this, so you know how that shit goes
Nigga it's gonna take a miracle
Call me a cab so i can ___ away and catch your hi-di-hi-di-ho
Fuck that, my style's all that and a bag of snacks
Ran through Jersey and the pussycat
I'm the Scooby with the Doo
I like my philly with the brew
All ya'll niggas talkin' shit about Puba, fuck you...
Ya know what you can do?
You can lick the twins when i pull 'em outta skins
And i put 'em in your face, you can tell me how it tastes
Cause its the Kronkite, nigga
Chorus

Here comes the Puba and you know I won't fake it
Usually bust records on gettin butt naked
Made for the Benzi, drive a nigga skins he
pump the tape, grab your dick, get with the Puba frenzy
C'mon honey sing, don't you, try to eject
_Slow Down_'s what you say, once my joint gets erect
Some try to copy but they just can't sketch it
Some try to follow but they just can't catch it
With the boom boom tap, yeah alla dat
Huh, I'm livin fat, me fall off, there'll be none of that
See who's the one to flip it?  Quick to tell a nigga to zip it
Stud drink the 40 cause we ain't got time to sip it
Grand Puba got body
Kick some of them, some of those, and some yardies
As dope as they come, suckers sing or hum
Don't try to step to this, you know your shit is slum
First batter up well here's the pitch - it's a curve
Second batter up because the first got served
The one who arouse, as I browse for a blouse
Kick styles by the piles, as I leave a trail for miles
Skins when I please, hit from here to Tel Aviv
I'm gettin G's, no more time for the line of free cheese
Here's the four one one hon, the one who gets the job done
I know you know the flavor of the Puba
""What goes around comes back around again..""

[GPM] Y'all you know the flavor.. Sincere Allah, check check check check!
[Grand Puba Maxwell]
O-kay o-kay o-kay, what more could I say?
Alamo get the boom and.. parlay parlay
I'm far from the average, civilize the savage
When I'm low on protein I'm with the bean soup and cabbage
Skins on the diet, kick the flavor, cause a riot
Do a show and get the dough and then I'm off to the Hyatt
So tie me on the spliff, ain't no ands or if
And if you really wanna riff you just might end up playin stiff
Girbauds hangin baggy, Hilfiger on the top
Knapsack on the back, that's just my flavor Hobbes
As my man gives a zigga zigga, watchin three grow bigga bigga
To Pos K, that's my nigga
Here goes the wreck, whaddayou expect?
If you wanna see some wreck, send cash, not a check
Grand Puba, more than a public figure
Quick to kick the bone up the butt of a golddigger
Now Tic-Tac-Toe means I hit three in a row
If I do a show then you better have my dough
Low, low, well how low can you go?
Call on Grand Puba if you really need a pro
Cause my shit's more rugged than G.I. Joe
Don't front honey, act like you know
Now big up to my Brooklyn mob (Brooklyn!  Brooklyn!)
Big up to my Uptown mob (Uptown!  Uptown!)
Now brothers wanna diss me cause it's my turn to burn
My best advice for the brothers is to sit back and learn
I don't diss nobody to be somebody
I just like to kick the flavor to make the people party
See all I'm sayin, is respect due
Those who tried to follow, sorry I left you
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie and Alamo
So if you ever want the flavor you know where to go
Now how we go..
Yeah, ha ha ha!
The reel to reel, yeah yeah yeah, this is how we move it
You know the flavor, y'all know the flavor, you know the flavor
Here we go yo, and you don't stop (big up to all the people)
Big up!  Big up!
Big Jeff hold tight!  Ha hah, ha hah!
On and on y'all
Time to get gone
Word is bond

So let's go ahead and get this started
Shorty gotta be a half a dub if I parted
Equal to my whip because I only ride exotic
If she not, watch me indo her when I do cotic
WHOA! you OK
Just get up cause we keep it movin' all day
So what chu' waitin' on it's time to get it crunky crunk
If the chicken off the wall and crackin'like they Humpty Hump
I'ma put it on ya just thought I'd warn ya
East Coast, Dirty, Midwest to California
I start, explore a hot broad like Ford
Slap a H on my chest and then I handle it accord
Didley, I be the nigga with the free

Grand Puba...yeah...uh
Let's talk about it, huh
[Hook]
If ya have a kid with a chick then I hope that chu' love her
There's no stress like Baby Mother
Some of these girls use a baby to get back at a brother
Cause it ain't the same as it was
Some cats bounce, leave the chick to play the daddy and mother
It's all about the kid and not her
If you and her don't work out then you still gotta handle your's nigga
So handle your business nigga
[Verse 1]
She got chu' for everything
The crib and the whip and the bling, ka-ching
Now if ya ain't feelin' shorty like that
Then you better put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on
And shorty if ya feel the same back
Then you better tell dude put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on
There be a whole lot of seeds made from Hennessey and trees
Once you raw dog hit it
The ya ass done committed
Cause ya dick is thinkin'
Too many trees, too much drinkin'
A one time resentment got you a lifetime commitment
You hate her now
You tell her get rid of that shit
But she had three abortions already so she's keepin' it
Now ya got drama with ya soon to be baby mama
Nine months of pregnancy
No hair no seed
It takes two to play
Connect that seed with that ay
So ya better strap it on if ya goin' all the way
Best night of ya life could be the worst of ya days
She'll have you unjust rappers talkin' bout chu' got to pay
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Now it's mommie's baby, daddy's maybe
If it go like it supposed to then the shit go great
You know what's up, if in doubt, do without
Or get that funny feelin' when ya ass is pullin' out
Like, what I just did
I hope I ain't make no kids
Every week you callin' (Yo you get cho' period?)
Some cats handle they biz some leave mothers stuck
Seed growin' up not knowin' who they daddy is
Misguided, undivided, tryin' hard to find it
Only seein' life one-sided
Come on do you
But if you got a seed make sure you do em' to
The same fuckin' way that chu' would do you
That's what's up, some more hood drama
And the baby daddy frontin' and it just be baby mama
A little bit of something
Is better than a whole lot of nothin'
Cause nothin' from nothin' leave ya nothin'
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So tell me why oh why
Why did I hit that straight up
I hate them chicks who threatin' niggas with that court shit
That support shit, knowin' a nigga bought shit
You don't want her so she really on some sore sport shit
It ain't about that seed no more, it's all about what she can get
But that's that bullshit but that's how some of em' do
There's only gonna be more drama if ya find somebody new
Now she hatin' you, ya ass is really due
If this new chick that chu' got is lookin' better than she do
Cats be flippin' too, soon as she find somebody new
They be loungin' in the crib, you be like who the fuck is you

Not the type to get some loot, then flip and be conservative

So cancel all the nonsense that you heard, thus far
You wanted the best at your request so here we are!
So call me the Grand man, I laid off the Sandman cause I like
workin nights, I hit some joints and then I get into flights
Then push Uptown to Shabazz, get a fish sandwich with bean soup
Half and half, sign a few, autographs, jet back

Yeah positivity over comes negativity check it.
A gat don't make you a man cause a man made the gat
So stop with the black on black  (x2)
Verse 1:
We got black on black
Black on crack
Knowledge of self is what the black people lack
Grew up in the projects with the welfare and the food stamps
Modern day concentration camps
Where we lost all our unity
Because the negativity pulls us down like gravity
Black people on eath others back
Little shortie sedated thinkin' the way out is by selling cracks
I seen black borthers cry like day by day the number multiply
And the devil don't give a damn long as a black man kills another black man
It makes his job more eaiser
As the tick goes with the tock he's just gettin'  sleezier and sleezier
Here's a good example of yourself
Talkin' about a devil on a record they put you on the shelf
As long as you talk about ""Yo I bust this nigga and I bust that nigga""
You grow bigger as a rap figure
But that's still black on black welcome back
It's time to graduate from that
Hook:
Change gon come change gon come time to free the dumb time to free the dumb
(x3)
Change gon come say what say what so get up out the slum
Verse 2:
Now let's deal on the real don't you set sick of this?
The way we hate eachother the shit's rediculous
It's time to move on to the next phase
Cause there's too many shorties gettin' boxed in the grave
Some think respect is an uzi or a tech
But when he steals your intellect it's like a rope around your neck
That's the 2000 tricknowledge
That's the shit you won't learn in college brother
You get to be strong you got to hold on
You got to know the ledge before you hit the edge
Time to get wise and civilize
Open up your eyes all three eyes and recognzie
What your doing all that bullshit you pursueing
Put your whole life on ruin
Let's kill the black on black vigga
Cause it only gets us locked up or in the box quicker
And that's ain't how you get the cheese
Cause now ya locked up or gunned down by your enemy
But I'm a deader that gat
Remember a gat don't make you a man cause a man made the gat
Word is born
Keep it true God keep it true (x8)
Puba talking:
KnowhatI'msayin'? Time to civilize you know get wise. Think. Stop and think
youknowhatI'msayin'? No doubt. Check it so just...
Stop think, listen to the God hear what he's sayin'. (x2)

Outro:
No doubt I'd like to send this one out to all the people still striving and

Uh!
[MJB] You know, you know I know (uh-huh)
Puba knows, how to flow
[GPM] So bear witness to the Grand Puba slickness
Better get your medication cause it spreads on the quickness
[MJB] Take notes to what's goin on
[GPM] Aiyyo, Grand Puba and Mary
[MJB] Won't steer you wrong!
[GPM] Hon it's just that shit
[MJB] Let's get it on!

Aiyyo, some try to flow
[MJB] But they just can't do it
[GPM] But you know how that go
[MJB] Ain't nothin to it
[GPM] But, to do it, run right through it
Those who know the time, huh, already knew it
I drink a Snapple and I wet my Adam's apple
And head straight for the center, the dope style inventor
Quick to make a buck, cause it's not beginner's luck
Type of shit that hits, when you pump it in your truck
Not Ashford and Simpson, Ike and Tina Turner
Sonny or Cher, it's somethin dope on your ear
So whether Monday
[MJB] Tuesday
[GPM] Wednesday
[MJB] Thursday
[GPM] Friday
[MJB] Saturday
[GPM] It don't make a matter
This is the type of shit to make the pockets fatter
It's simply splendid, the way that we bend it
But it's time for me to jet, so I'ma let Mary end it
[Mary J. Blige]
You know, you know I know
Puba knows, how to flow (got it goin on)

Check..
Well here's the good to go cause it gets good when it's goin
It ain't so-and-so'n it's just Grand Puba flowin
Stud Doogie, Alamo, on the ziggie rub the table
Kunta Kinze droppin ? on some old, shake the leg shit
Now it's time to flow, since we formally introduced us
Jump up on the stage and watch the honies seduce seduce us
Watch the three sprout beyond shadow of a doubt
Here's the resume, for the day, you know the flav, skin out
Here's the rootin tootin type of shit to make you lose it
The way it should be done, so I know you won't refuse it
It's on the reel to reely, kick shit on the daily
Grab a 40 hit the floor like I danced at Alvin Ailey
So honey don't front just winey wine
Cause a bit bo-ty girl stay on my mind
Here's Mr. Splendid, careful when I bend it
Highly recommended flippin shit like I intended
So here goes the flow, check how it go
And don't act like you don't.. (""you should know"")
Ha hah!
Next skit, on the stupid shit, this is how we flip the script
Niggaz try to follow but come off it!
Lone Ranger, not afraid of danger
You know the shit is real so don't play me like a stranger
Studda give a cut so precise like a guillotine
The kid ain't Michael son cause I'm the one who hit Billie Jean
Quick to say parlay, fond of Bob Marley
You know the four one one hon, we're _Jammin_
So, clear the road, here comes Mr. Got-It-Goin-On
Jump on the mic, grab my pay and after that I'm gone
To Indiana, Virginia or Savannah
A backed up town to give a shout to Susannah
C'mon brothers cause you know what I'm talkin on
Hi, how ya doin, Bill hit the joints and then move on
The way we sway makes the others just fade away
The name of this one here is check the resume
So get with it, cause you damn sure won't forget

YouknowhatI'msayin?  Pumpin it like this

Grand Puba, Stud Doogie, Alamo style
Word is bond, big up to the S.O.S. cause they do it best
YouknowhatI'msayin?  Pop in the house, Big Jeff in the house
B.R. in the house, youknowhatI'msayin?
This is how we flowin it on, time to get gone

Ding dong goes the doorbell and I'm straight for the nightie she said hold on a sec while I get the place tidy. I steps in with a Puba grin and I say how ya been but all I'm thinking is skin. What's on the agenda for the night? She said HBO is booming and Foreman's about to fight. Cool I'm down to see him drop a body so I dimmed the lights and it was me and this hottie. Round1, round2 and the fight was through and I was thinking of all the things I could do. I put my arm around her shoulder this is what I told her baby grab a holda I'm as solid as a boulder. She said stop it she tried to change the topic I said come on honeydip cuz ya know I wanna knock it. Then she broke down in tears and I been waiting like weeks but weeks feel like years. Puba I thought you was a friend? I said whatya sayin hon? I gets no skin? I gave her some advice I put the shit on ice and then I told her come on honey don't front, honey don't front...
Now hon was a good friend. She was more than just a bend. What's a bend? A bend is when you spread the skins. Why pretend? Honey pulled the garter in. She pulled it in cuz she didn't  wanna see the Jim. Now, now, now just wait a sec. In cases like this Puba usually gets wreck. But this time I settled for a raincheck. Before I left I put a kiss on her neck. I like to civilize em first before I run up in. Educate them then politely speak upon the skins. I'm the type of nigga to be careful of a digga and I still can't figga how they try to play a nigga so come on honey cuz I know ya not a stunt. But there ain't no reason  for you to front.

Every day we get caught up in the struggle (Uh)
So we can live life, love, and bubble

Some jump up in the music game to get the green
Some do the acting thing to blow up on the movie screen
Some play ball hope they're drafted by a pro team
Some say ""man I'ma play the hood and serve the fiends""
Some go to school and after that do that college thing
Some drop out, get high, play the hood and bang
Some do the Wall Street, investors, stocks and bonds
Some don't do shit and still home chilin' with their moms
Some move faster, get their Master's
Doctors, lawyers, self-employors
Some do Mickey-D's or some food spots
Some be radio jocks and slice niggas at barber shops
You got blue-collar cats, you got white-collar cats
You got no-collar cats tryin' to stack a stack
You got cats who spend all day sippin'
And you got cats who just layin' back pimpin'

[Verse 2]
Now you got some who play the store and boost gear
And you got some who hustle heads doin' here
And you got some who secretary, bank tellers
And you got some who just look good for they fellas
You got some who's independent, doin' they thing now
And you got some who wanna be they just don't know how
You got some who babysit, daycare and shit
And you got some who hate they job and wanna quit
You got some who housewives, wanna stay at home
And you got some who's big bosses like Sylvia Rome
You got some who shake for dollars, slide down a pole
And you got some who stressed, playin' the mommy-daddy role
You got some who spend their whole life savin'
You got some who's lookin' for that rest haven
And you got some who tell that boss to kiss they ass
And you got some who think makin' sellin' ends

[Verse 3]
Somebody tried to tell you Heaven or Hell is when ya die
Got chu' guessin' there's a better place up in the sky
See I see Heaven and Hell right here on this planet Earth
But mostly Hell ever since my first day of birth
I've seen Heaven from a distance, use my persistance
Overcome resistance and get me some

Get up and handle yours if ya tired of bein' poor

Verse One:
Here I go with the new style, such a versatile child
Hons crack a smile as the dancers hit the tile
General like Custer, spread skins like mustard
Brothers try to copy but they shit sound busted
or should I say chopped, brothers need to stop
Once Puba shits, you know the joint is grit
More followers than Jehovah, call me Casanova
Used to drive a Nova, but now I push a Rover
Pumpin nuff hits, scoopin mad chicks
A golden brown complexion and you won't find a zit
I take a sip of my brew, before the night is through
Honies askin Pu', ""Can you woo woo woo?""
Yes I got the skills that'll always pay the bills
""My, my, my,"" like Johnny Gill
Quick to knock the block baby all around the clock
Ticky-ticky-tock, ticky-ticky-tock
So don't try to play the Puba (cause ain't nothin happenin)
Don't even waste your time (cause ain't nothin happenin)
Step left with that garbage (cause ain't nothin happenin)
You know why black?  (Why is that?)  Bust it, cause I get

Verse Two:
Follow me now see
Ooh la la la, me say take to dis guy on de natural high
Ooh la la la, me say come follow me, come come now
Ooh la la la, me say take it to dis guy on de natural high
Ooh la la la, me say come follow me, bust it
I caught wreck in a sec with a girl that I met
at this discotheque, now let me recollect
Mmm, the night was lovely, oh so lovely
She still thinks of me
Now I keep my hair peasy, mo' fine and greasy
Never hit the skins if the skins look sleazy
Sweetheart, here goes a hint, you better take a mint
cause I can smell the scent
Now if I smoked a bag of sess, I still wouldn't mess
with a girl in a tight dress, cause a tight dress
just won't impress, but you can try your best
and it still won't matter
Game for a quickie, I can make a sticky
Hold on the hickie, cause next week it's Vicky
Rhyme style fat, the God'll break a back
of a new jack, or old jack, who wants to sweat the sac
Time for the papes so you better drink some coffee
Hon thinks she knows me, but bitch back up off me
Puba, you know my word is bond, peace to the Gods
and I got to move on, cause you know I get

Verse Three:
Bust it I'ma drop one more before I travel like sound
Brothers say Puba, I'm happy that you makin it
Then turn around and tell a female some other shit
Sincere, you bear my witness (True indeed)
A nobody in somebody's business
Mind your own neck, and go collect your Mickey D's check
But when you see me give me nuff respect
Sincere Allah how do you think I should take it?
(Let's slide them niggaz down Lincoln butt naked)  Bust it!
I'm not the Captain or the Skipper, got it good behind the zipper
Now if honey wants to flip you know the God'll have to flip her
I won't smack it but I'll flip it and I'll rub it down
Catch a movie and a dinner and then I'm back uptown
I rock beats on the daily really when I'm in the mood
Attitude never screwed, I only eat the righteous food so
cut on the amp and I can show you who's the champ
The man who leaves with all the scamps cause I gets over

Crabs in the back room, holdin' each other back
Until the day we die, uh
I been droppin' knowledge like this for a long long time
They don't feel me
When I strive to help the dumb deaf fly
Long as I'm sittin' bullshit is just fine
But when I speak on them, that's when they draw the line
Conspiracy is a theory, let's promote the black-on-black
Niggas don't know how to act
Let em' send each other back

Too many niggas bein' locked away
Realize what's really goin' on
And how the black community got so torn
How many more mothers gotta mourn

Somebody tell me what's that all about
There's too many shorties checkin' out
My nigga's locked up for a lifetime
Didn't even get a chance to use his lifeline
The game is setup for you to lose
So watch the po-po cause like Tom they cruise
Focus get cha' head straight, fix ya plate
Learn from others and don't make the same mistake
Know who you are, where ya at, and where ya goin'
The worst thing about life is not knowin'
Knowledge break it down it's know to ledge
Cause if you don't know the ledge you droppin' off edge
The hood drama is horrific
Enough ghetto tears for years that could fill up Pacific
I'm not standin' here tryin' to be no preacher
But each one, teach one, hope I reach ya
See I'm here to enter brain then I entertain
Those who lost one in the struggle, I feel ya pain
Cause everyday somebody else is gettin' blown
But we don't moan until it hits close to home
Hear me y'all cause the numbers seem to multiply
And that's the reason that I ask myself
How many more gotta die
How many more mothers gotta cry
How many more locked away for life

In that time, a nigga didn't see nor hear
Got to the point, there was no respect at all

Spent nights in my cell just beatin' my dick
Thinkin' bout, how we used to fuck and shit
I took you out, bought cha' ass a bunch of shit
When I get out
I'm gonna fuckin' punch this bitch right in her mouth
Cause she don't understand the rules
You don't bite the man that dipped your hand in jewels
You were there when I bought the rock that blinded you
Now a nigga locked and I can't find you

Verse 1:
I knew from jump that my shit was gonna hit
Cause I spoke to Dione Warick and she put me on some psychic shit
She said becareful cause these girls be throwin' block
I said D don't even worry I sweat no girl for they stank box
I like drinkin' honey hit me a 5-1-6
Girl:
What's a 5-1-6?
Puba:
Long Island you dumb bitch
When it comes to this my style flows Free like Willy
Watch me grab the cream like them Beverly Hill Billy
I know you're happy with the shit you just bought
It's the greatest return since Jordan hit the court
Because my style changes frequently
See I been shit talkin' mics since the days of delenquency
Now I'm still the same low down gold teeth and Gortex
And on occassion with the ruff sex
Stud Doogie heats it up like a flannel
Cause he's smooth as wall panel
Hits the one and two like a freebee channel
I have no time for bullshitters I get bad honies jitters
As I walk be all the chickenhead critters
I got more funk then En Vogue got junk in they trunk
My flow hits ya like a filty piece of skunk
So Alley get the scomma fromt he dodge spot
Put it in the L and get high like an astronaut
Hook
Verse 2:
Now see they call me Mr. Mingo
Got a girl but I'm still single
Honies scream my name (PUBA) like they just won bingo
I take 'em out for a dinner or a show but you know how the rest go
Hey man no doe
You know the type you go out a few nights they sweat your pockets tight
Cause they rock they're rockers right
Go away little girl you gets nothing
But here take a Bufferin to ease your pain and sufferin'
Cause I'm so aware of too many things
I know what I know if ya know what I mean
Come clean because I'm a fiend for a beat and a theme
Comin' strong like Hakeem and it ain't a dream
Now is it me or is this hittin' like Tyson?
Like a plate of beans and rice I be a needy winds on ice and
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie on the nights I bag the dumb we hit a nut
And then we back up in her guts
See I get down and dirty like an arceologist
I get deep into your mind like a psycologist
I hit brothers in the head with the real
Bag honies like a charm cause Grand Puba is the bomb
So come on baby there's no need to play dumber
Or I be comin' around your nostrals when I cum
So check it out now...

I want y'all to put your hands together
And to bring on a brother
that's bound to lay more dips in your hips
More gliiiiide in your stride
And if you don't dig what's next
you got the wrong damn address
[Grand Puba - steadily getting louder]
He's coming, he's coming, he's coming (8X)
Bo!  Lickshot for the blood claat
talkin that what-not, Puba come and hit on the right spot
Rhyme teller for the ladies and the fellas
and I only kick the flavor for my fellow ghetto dwellers
No rock'n'roll, it's just soul
Ain't nuttin changed, I still like to hit the hole
with my pole, smoke a stog' and then I roll
And when my corn hurts I wear a Dr. Scholl
I make beats, then I hit sheets
Then I build with the Gods to get the addicts off the nod
Grand Puba, and I drop a album yearly
And I'm very nearly really come to droppin shit like daily
My knowledge is bond, so you brothers better move on
You brought your wack style, come play the horn
Grand Puba Maxwell, not on the Hollywood tip
Here comes a brother more than _2 Legit to Quit_
I'm not sleazy but I like it nice and easy
Ain't nuttin changed, I still wear my hair peasy
I like to dig it, that's how we done done dug it
I tend to work for all the ones who like to wig it
*samples cut and scratched by Alamo, including
""I got a story I want to tell you"", ""I like to tell it like it is""*
""Second time around""
[Grand Puba]
Check, I get boom service just like room service
And when I jump upon a stage I'm not a bit nervous
I kick the reel to rell, I never been to jail
Oops maybe one time but I had a good time
I keep my pants saggin, I'm never lolligaggin
Niggaz try to copy this they on the bandwagon
I shake my thing I do I pull a hamstring and then I call a old fling
Gotta Spike her and tell her _Do the Right Thing_
Ron Studda do the rap, Alamo'll do the overdub
'Fore we hit these 40's G, we gotta get some grub
Grand Puba *inhales* Let me take a breather
Get you hot like a fever, you'll be slammin even
So don't bother, it's the new Godfather
Tell your godson that Grand Puba is the one
""Way back in, history, the Prodigal Son
was a, wealthy man"" (2X)
[Grand Puba]
Sing it baby, ha ha ha, bust it
No more skid row, can't get a show
Time to kick a new flow, and make the dough y'know?
I'm a Pisces I like to drink iced teas
I'm a Reese's with all the pieces
Or the Alomnd with the Joy, ten years from a boy
When I work out Puba go see Roy's
next to thirty-three, where Stud lives
You won't catch the Puba doin nothin negative
Now honey don't like me cause I won't dance like Hammer
Honey ask Hammer, can he speak Puba's grammar?
I can shake a leg if I want to, but I don't want to
cause that's what my dancers do
Now I give the next man his props
But when it comes to micraphones, c'mon, give me mine Hobbes
I won't diss the next brother to be great that's not my trade
but every brother, ain't a brother, word to the mother
or praises to the father, you wanna try to see this
Don't even bother!
Grand Puba, for those who came late
You try to step to this, then I'll end up-state
Word is bond, let's move on and on and on
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go!
Big up to my Now Rule brothers
All the cool ones, not the fool ones
And we gon' move it like this for the year ninety-two
Big up to my man, Positive K
Big up to my cousin Jeff
And allatha and allathat
This is how we gon' move this yo, word is bond
S.D., in the house
Definitely pumpin the shit like this
And this is how we gon' do it yo

Everybody in my neighborhood said ""Puba don't stop""
It was a four-man crew, Don Barren
My Mighty Shabazz, Dr. Who, and me, Grand Pu
Things started blowing up on a quick fast
Doing shows, buying clothes, getting crazy cash
I still stayed the same, ran around with my hair nappy
Matter of fact I'm doing good, made the jealous ones unhappy
""I knew you would make it"" was their favorite line
But ""Fuck that, I hope he fall"" is really on their mind
Just because I found a way to make my pockets stay fat
Now a new thing: ""Puba thinks he's all that""
Yes, but there's a found way to better my condition
""Bad luck, bad luck"" is what the jealous ones keep wishing
Oh a crew broke up? I knew they wouldn't last
But I refuse to lose so I bounce back on that ass
One for All, Brand Nubian
Yeah, that's the new thing, now they back up on my ding-a-ling
Run and tell my girl, ""Yo, Puba did this
He did that,"" cause they nose is in my crack
Like a reporter, but they don't earn a quarter
To do that (Yo, they just jealous, black)
You know the flavor, of that jealous behavior
I'm just like Jesus Christ cause I'm you're modern day savior
So hon knock it off, worry about your own shit
Just because your man ain't shit, there ain't no need to rhyme *ahem*
Same ones that used to wave, now they sticking up their finger
But I guess that's the price you pay when you become a rap singer
I work hard, word to God, with supreme motivation
To find a way out since '85, try to jam my situation
But that's okay because my old Earth told me
""Keep on moving, don't stop, hon""
Now I'll be damn if Grand Pub don't get it done
I've no time to slow my roll on a jealous one
See I love to help others because Puba cares
I do more for my people than WIC or Welfare
Next time you see a brother down, stop and pick him up
Cause you might be the next one stuck
Word is bond, let's move on
And we building on the situation of that in lyrics
Always trying to hold the black man back
We can't live like that, we gotta help each other
You know what I'm saying?  Brother to brother
Sister to sister, know what I'm saying?
Stay out my business, worry about your own, know what I'm saying?
Worry about your own, knowledge knowledge

Play it cool and move it slow....
(Sadat X)
The nature of these humans is to wanna see rip
Is to wanna see a fight and say should not write
I say let bygones be bygones and let's make this cash
Let's get this doe and astill let niggaz know
It's alot of bad bitches in Atlanta
New York is there and it's ripe for the killing
I say hit me wit a stack, let me live, let me do mine
Let me be aight, when I rest in the night
If you want it, you can get it
Don't make theatrics if you got soft tactics
There's alot of actors out there in the movies
And even more actors in the rap game
I keep my shit in place so I can reach all my people
So I won't confuse the words that I choose
The Brand Nubian combo, Grand Puba ensemble
Will make a nigga hungry, give him a piece of fried fish
Known Alamo for 25 years
So when I say pass the beef, then Ali passed the beef
Wack rappers be sliding by the skin of they teeth
No label could ever be able to stop me
They might try to prop me. put me on promotions, but yo, fuk that
Just give me my money, ain't a damn thing funny ?(real lust)?
Life is a 3 ring circus, all of the ups and downs of the carousel
That I knew so well, check it out
Cuz money's what the two's all about
Chorus
(Grand Puba)
Keep it going, no doubt, no doubt, no diggedy
Hey me and Doogie bag mad doe
Wit that nigga 'Mo, niggaz try to see it but they moving (move slow)
So tell me what the fuk is it
Weak cyphers can't wait for the God to come and visit
Niggaz don't know on the d-low
Me and my man Sadat is mad (cool) and we bagging doe
So save the boo for Betty, I shred niggaz like confetti
Bagging loot and I'm jetti, so are you ready to learn
Of putting niggaz on ruin, coming stronger than Ewing
I put the tic wit the tac cuz I'm the knick wit the knack
So save the patty for the wack and it'll stem from the crack
You know what, I don't hit guts of no nasty sluts
Or get strung on butts, I just hit 'em wit the roach deluxe
Cuz Doogie, you know how shit do
So Sadat, let's bag this money, then push back to the bungaloo
Go and tell your motehr, it's return of the blues
(We can do it better) so fuk them others
Cuz I ain't trying to hear it
Then if time and giving loot, I be fuking five women
The location now, we don't even ask while
Lyrics so deep they keep passing you by
I'm cutting niggaz down like drive by
Niggaz can't keep, cuz yo, money, your shit is dry

Watch me run the ghetto scheme, givin all the honies wet dreams
I'm gonna hit you where the drip go drop
and make your whole body tickle as we smack the nine-nickel, so
here we come, here go that flow son
I be the one who get it done and I ain't done until after honey come
You see my flow is great, no greater
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a motherfuckin playa hater
Cause they hungry like Wally Gator
Why jealous niggaz try?  I ain't Woody and this ain't Woodpecker Pie
Is it cause who we be

Or just, playa hate us, be undercover
Jealous cause we MC brothers

Let's go somewhere far, dig it

When I'm goin I'm gone, it won't stop the dawn
But I be careful cause the monster be lurkin
Some honies got it bad where them rubbers don't be workin
Some stinkbox are like that Park called Jurassic
Slide up in the cut, it burns your rubber up like acid
So if you're playin them games, you best be careful
Don't let the 5-1-6 make you dareful
There you go, feelin good, you're out of town
And it's one of those nights, you feel like gettin down
You ain't choosy on the honey you picked
No glove on your stick, you just wanna hit it quick
So you get down for your crown to represent
Honey's runnin somethin, cause that short stay loot is spent
There you go, slidin raw dog again
Now you're singin New Edition song, ""Is This the End?""

Rudebwoy!
Fiyah!  Here comes the rudebwoy, ah ahh!
Proper education, education
Proper education
Proper education, education
Proper education
Now let me tell you folks just exactly what I mean
The way they try to lower, the black man's self esteem
Put us in their schools and I call em mental graves
When they teach us bout ourselves, all we learn that we were slaves
Then they say Jesus was white, understand
that means that Mystery God in the sky's a white man
These two things alone make us start to feel inferior
Then we grow up thinkin they are superior
Why does the black licorice taste the worst?
Why does the black jellybean taste the worst?
Why do the bad guys always wear black?
Why is bad luck when you see a black cat?
Cause they're workin subconciously, subconciously
Workin subconciously
Workin subconciously, subconciously
Workin subconciously
This is why we must teach our strong black nation

Yes lord!  Easy now star!  Come again!
Now they gave restitution to the Japanese
You see they gave restitution to the Jews
Now over 400 years of slavery rape and murder
but I guess there's no restitution for the coons
They wanna use us a tool, and also as a slave
in the land of the free and the home of the brave
Musa came to the cave and taught them Ock
the tricknowledge that the Devil once forgot
Now the ten percent rules over the eighty-five
You see we have to do more than just keep hope alive
I don't hope and I don't do dope
but I still feel the pain from my ancestors swingin on a rope
Now pardon me as I distill on a Devil's grill
Now me trust a Devil, huh, I never will
I just catch my ?, grab my button, put it on my lapel
Grab my people and get out of hell
See this is why we must teach our young black nation
Proper education, education
Yes
Yes, we would like to say peace to all the Gods and the Earths
People of the universe

I would like to say peace to my brother Tony X
Yes

Knowledge Cipher, divided by Power Equals Wisdom
But you know we have to start with Knowledge first
Divine evil's what dispearse in a hearse
Situation that we in, some people sayin that we're cursed
The lack of the knowledge of ourselves makes it worse
Science that we drop, make the average head burst
So do the knowledge on the very next verse
I heard a brother say, ""I wash the clothes, I cook your food
I pay your rent,"" now is that how the story went?
Emphatically no, singer singin that weak wisdom knowledge
Shit Haji God is here to cancel it
So just ring the alarm, another Devil's dying, boooohhh
Just ring the alarm, an Uncle Tom is tryin, boooohhh
I didn't come to conceal it, I come to reveal it
The True and Living God with the son of man (son of man)
And if you ever need assistance just take my hand
Black man be prepared cause here comes the Klan
Now my great great Grand, was hung on a tree
by the colored man -- you probably know him as a white man
I seen a Oprah Winfrey show, she said that was in the past
but [bitch], kiss my [ass]
Now it's time to teach the people, why our people's not
treated equal, here's the next sequel (speak on it God)
Askin taller than the tallest wall, you ever saw
Sincere gave the God a call, we boost it from the mall
Long as it's a Devil I'ma take it
If a Devil catch me right, I leave him buttnaked (yessir yessir)

The soul controller (soul controller)

Grab ahold of your mental cause this next verse is deep
Now check out the thing and what they did to Rodney King
That goes to show ya, who controls ya
The Devil man when brothers went lootin in Cali
they used the corder-cam, the same as the police man
But I bet my last bottom dollar G
The brothers that they picked up won't go free
See I'm a, disbeliever when it comes to jungle fever
Aiyyo God you trust the Devil?  (Now Cipher)  Me neither
Now brothers say, ""Why you diss the church like Ock?""
Cause if church was good for us, it wouldn't be on every block
of our neighborhood, just like a liquor store, it just ain't
no good -- they represent the ten percent
Now Momma Lova has no loot, but she'll spend her last dime
to make sure her child has an Easter suit
What is this with Christmas, I just can't see
spendin your money, givin the credit
to a fat man comin down your chimney (c'mon)
I just can't see it, it's like TV tellin lies to your vision
Haji God is here to make the incision

We can act dumb and leave niggas backs numb
I wanna eat on some legal and shit
But I was born on some evil shit
Ridin' ways, my childhood is far from forgotten days
See moms locked away, that's why I hate cops today
So I cop the yay, lock the block, pumpin' trays
If I reach and shoot, believe that niggas lay
But I went through my trigger phase
Now I want a bigger case
Fuck dippin' jakes now we sittin' great

Yo, it's a shame how these bitches wanna know if I'm holdin' a knot

My mental states I been through breakdown airway
Bottles or rat, nigga straight sleep with the fishes
My team is vicious, holla at the baddest bitches
Know what I got, hit the crib hot cold to rock
Steamin' off the top then my soldiers box
Flip the score, plot ways to hustle on tours
See these hit the pipe, fuck up they jaw

Check out the ringle, hit the spot that'll tingle
Make the hons wanna jingle, I stay crisp like a Pringle
Check how we set off, last stop's where we get off
You know it's flavor, three shots lick the glock off
BUCK BUCK BUCK, you know how it go
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie, and Alamo
So what's the 411?
Loungin black
Hilfiger knapsack with a 40 in the back
So hon shake the goodies don't front on the puddy
With the rubber and the hoodie I peck the hole like Woody
Show no shame, with everything to gain
Honies always singin, how can I ease the pain?
When they think I'm comin back but that's game
This is the real, how I wheel and deal
First round draft pick like big Shaquille O'Neal
Shit's so dope that I might catch a steal
Stud Doogie, Alamo, spin the wheel
Cause that's how we move it
This is how we move it
Well that's how we move it
This is how we move it
That's how we move it
This is how we move it
Aiyyo Doogie how we move it
This is how we move it
I'm with this rich girl named Dawn, hit the skins on the lawn
Ron Stud had her sister in the crib playin Twister
They lived in Poughkeepsie, moms was a gypsy
Pops was in the crib but he was upstairs tipsy
Know I got soul, baby jump upon a pole
Janet Jackson took a ride, she's no longer _In Control_
The bedroom worked, not a bone jerker
Good like Black and Decker knockin skins from here to Mecca
Like one two three, or A-B-C
Or Do-Re-Mi-Fa-So-La-Ti
Honey called me brilly, I told her she was silly
Cut my ex-girl off cause she worked my last frilly
The new skin shower, micraphone goer
Girls follow me like animals did Noah
From Tracy, to Pattie, Linda down to Tina
Everytime I see some skins then pop goes the weener
Puba, the devil roaster, I keep a tool in my holster
Mess with me and I'll be on a wanted poster
Cause that's how we move it
This is how we move it
Well that's how we move it
This is how we move it
That's how we move it
This is how we move it
You know the deal huh, spin the wheel
Yeah, check it
It's time to switch it up so I'll breeze back to the rest
Put on some Polo gear and a baggy pair of Guess
Put on my baseball cap, refill my knapsack
This ain't Poltergeist, but I'm back!
You know the M.O. on Doogie Alamo
Cuts so sharp make like Shaft and get an afro
Better yet you can take it down low
Al's my man but that perm gotta go gotta go
So all you copycat rhymers swine'n'dinin on the riblets
Get downtown, see my mic on exhibit
No need to worry, cause I'll be there in a hurry
Yo hon I'll smack it out like Darryl Strawberry
Keep your head spinnin, cause I only heard of winnin
Played the game before so I can go the extra inning
Grand Puba, Stud Doogie, Alamo here to prove it
This is how we move it
Cause that's how we move it
This is how we move it
That's how we move it
This is how we move it
That's how we move it baby
This is how we move it
Aiyyo Doogie how we move it
This is how we move it

Now for those who don't know me, or those who forgot
Guess who came back to blow the God-damn spot
(Puba knows, ?? knows)
If you back that thang up on me watch it grow
This is for you haters who doubt me
For you ladies who be thinkin about me
Who can't (Be without me, pee without me)
Style inventor, make ya party hot when I enter
Five percent of the one who vibin for a Riker
Summer, winter - flowin since the days of the center
If I, bent her, slid up in the skin like a splinter
The flamethrower lock it down like a boa
If she's anything less than a dime, I don't know her
Make ya system rattle like a whole herd of cattle
Unseen wolves stay prepared for the battle
I still can't swallow what they done to dude Diallo
I guess I be a legend cuz I smashed the Apollo
[Chorus]
[Grand Puba]
I'm the always complimented, never compensated
Rich think I'm poor and the poor think I made it
I'm underrated, complicated
So highly advanced, from now on when I write rhymes
I got a post date to seven years ago
I made that album Two Thou
It's 2002 so I'm seven years from now
Back from another planet, where everything be organic
Where the ugly chicks be lookin like Janet
So hold that (hold that) I went from skinny to fat
Now I'm back to ""all that"" liftin three off the mat
Well God-damn! This shit stank on fire like a gas tank
Let's work it out like Billy Blanks
The hot shit to keep the E light from flashin off the pocket
Rotisserize them chickenheads like I'm Boston Market
We spark shit, make it hot as hot can get
Forever dawg it don't quit
[Chorus]
[Grand Puba]
Let me see that... I.D., so I can verify that age
Ain't tryna have po-po come and snatch me off the stage
I move faster than a New York minute
First grade the first time I got suspended
The first time I rubbed her ass, the class winked and hid it
Used to cruise the projects in my toy car tinted
with the next-door neighbor daughter in it
Now I'm movin asses for a livin
For you haters, forgive and forget
It ain't no givings I'm that rafter, knowledge power
My dawgs understand the culture, but hold on lemme translate that
Knowledge power, that's fifteen
Understandin culture's number thirty-four
Big Oak that's my dawg, better yet my handle's like Kobe's
But in Dolby, sip on Sobe while I politic and business
with Gishobi and ya don't quit
Grand Pub' from Problem House
show me love if you like the way I {*hauch* *skirt*}

[Verse 1]
Right now, Grand Puba 'bout to blow this mic out
Got'cha movin like roaches with the lights out
Finger-lickin like chicken in a dyke's house
Don't stop, get it poppin like Redenbacher
Move more feet than Koreans in a nail shop
Keep it ghetto like Bodega's after twelve o'clock
Shorty shakin like a chick up in the booty spot
That's what's up, can't you smell what the Pub-ah cookin
Got a girl with a wife on his side and still lookin
You know my style is +Always+ like Coca-Cola
I flip out like Skytel-Motorola
In two-thou, my new Benz is ridin solar
And my seed got a V8 in the stroller
You know the 4-1-1, see it's time to make the paper pile
Ain't no need to act funny style
[Hook]
Ain't no need to stop (Uh)
Puba 'bout to drop (Yeah)
Get that ass (What?) Out on that floor (Uh-huh)

Give it all ya got (Uh)
Move it up and down like a Chevy 6-4 (Yeah)
You know how it's going down
Grand Puba is back in town
Baby ain't no time to climb
Go up and down and up and down
[Verse 2]
Now you may ask yourself who the hell I be
Some consider me, a legend emcee
Who never wear platinum or wore less gold
I been makin y'all move since I was nineteen years old
Listen I've been ballin in this game a long time
Been through more counties than the Greyhound line
Grand Puba, Brand Nub' affiliate
Twelfth birthday I got my first Big Willy pit
Mad love for the game ever since I was a youth
Used to set up my equipment on the project roof
Two turntables, microphone, and some vinyls
Now I bounce through town in a smoked out rider
Let's get it crackin if ya know how it's goin down
Don't stop, get it get it, shake ya body to the ground
Grand Puba gettin all up in that skull
Shine so hard I make ice look dull
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Grand Puba still settin new trends (Mm-hmm)
Still runnin with the Nubians (Mm-hmm)
Still in the Range when I'm not in the Benz (Mm-hmm)
You don't know, ya better ask your friends (Mm-hmm)
Who wants to be a millionaire?
Buy a mansion next door to the Beck's in Bel-Air
and chip paper like he don't care
Buy all the shit that you want and need
In the Y2K I'm like the gameshow Greed

Cause Grand Puba got that game so won't cha, let me try (let me try)
Now just because I drive a Mercedes Benz (whooa yeah yeah)

The one who flims the flam the one who plays weak MC's out like ham
I got the style that be bangin'
When the flow gets to slangin'
I be leavin' MCs hangin'
On my jammy just swangin'
So many brothers try to be me
Only two can probably see me that's Ray Charles and Stevie
My shit knocks from Lincoln popcorn down to Frangle Rock
Me turn pop?
Save that shit for Arnold Redenbach
Cause when it comes to this see Puba's not a stranger
Get the honies hooked like they kids is hooked on Power Rangers
And I ain't goin' now where word is born
Cause I've been doin' this since Shay Shay Lafon
I tell my record people everyday
We do this my way cause when it comes to my music I don't play
I'll came and slay ya or I may ah
Make sure my gettaway is more swifter than O.J.

Leave another stuck my scoop is how I get it done
There goes the little drummer boy so purumppapumpum
It's Grand Puba hon I hit it ruff like ? and still puffin' stuff
I smack some mingos and sit back and watch my pockets fluff
Grand Puba here to get the party strarted
See I come with thee exotic
While you're puffin' your narcotics
I'll be damned if this don't hit cha where it's suppose to get cha

[Hook: Grand Puba and Tiffany Johnson]
What you gonna do for me, hey
If I spend this dough
Nigga don't try to think, oh
That I'm just one of these hoes
I'm just tryin' to holla at you, hey
To see where your head is at
Don't think cause you bought me a drink, oh
That you gon' have me on my back
[Tiffany Johnson]
He loves me, nah he loves me not
He probably thought I was in love but I loved his knots
It's hard to resist, shit what type of offer is this
Niggas drive me nuts cause all they offer is dick
Oil me up, talk slick, say what they will
But the last time I checked, dick don't pay the bills
Dick can't get a crib and dick can't get a car
If I decide to buy up will I get that far
What chu' thought, I should go ahead and extort
Combin' through dough, brushin' up my credit report
Play what I'm dealt, that attitude placed on a shelf
Shit I act like I'm the only child and play with myself
When you wax off I wax on
Twist trees so I can get a lil' higher
Like steppin' in platforms
In the supreme, then I'm spillin' the beans
Switch ya shit like gettin' chips from a vending machine
[Hook]
[Grand Puba]
Is you a gold digger or is you diggin' a nigga
Dig the way I put it down or tryin' to dig in my figures
See I don't stress ass, I play McNabb and pass
Put some ass next to money watch me snatch the cash
I might beat it up, send it along
If I don't recognize you next time I see you
Cause you got clothes on
Listen Mommie Playa, playin' me is no chance
Better off in a titty bar doin' a lap dance
I'm not new to this, recognize them hoes like Ludacris
Gotta be inside of her mind before we reach the whip
You know the situation, no chicken chasin'
Bounced more chicks outta my Cipher than immigration
Cause this is Grand Puba
How you like to bring it on
Chicks doin' flips yellin' rah, rah, rah
It ain't about what I'm gonna do for you
Fuck the dumb shit baby, what chu' gon' do for me
[Hook]
[Grand Puba]
Uh, wish I with it is you single or committed
Niggas got the full court press tryin' to hit it
OK miss, we gon' do it like this
I'ma spend a lil' dough, buy you a big bottle of Cris..co
Go fry some fish yo, you know how the story go
Gotta get to know ya before I start trickin' dough
After that we see what's up, I tell ya what we do
Take a ride in the truck up to FoxWood Casino
P caught trial up or we can keep it ghetto
Play the crib and get stuck
Crack a bottle smoke a lot with the flat screen, what
I'm far from Armani
Watch me slide up in the cut
Like a thong up in a fat girl's butt
That's heavy, make chicks bounce ass like a Chevy
I hold it down like I arrest revies
Grand Puba, you know how I'ma flip it
Gotta buy a car, whip, doughnut
And change up to plane tickets so

Just feel me now, it's time to do this here
Pull the clutch and pop that ass in gear
2-K-2, well baby it's our year
No need to fear because Puba's here
So ain't no need to be curious
Listen, love this is something serious
Don't stop girl just hurt shit
Work it, work it, work it
[Grand Puba]
Me and you, one on one
Baby don't stop now, cause here I come
It's the Grand Puba baby and I think you aught to know that
Don't forget mommie, write it down, take a Kodak
Shorties feel my flow, always wanna know my Zodac
Pisces at one time but it changed into dollar sign
It only takes one line for me to make love to ya mind
Dose of it and get a feel free to press rewind
Know for spittin' flames, watch me drop it like some rain
Lop side em' in this game, so you tell me who is sane
Styles so sick my engineer's a paramedic
Shorty could I what, no sugar I'm diabetic
Grand Puba garbage, not in ya wildest wishes
Decide to crack it on the corner seein' the full click

Miss Prissy, straight from the big titty committee
Low down and gritty, hickey'd up plus strictly dick me
Nervous, best believe that shorty work this
Pop lip service, tip of the tongue tap cervix
Cry baby, dangerous my curves get
Never fuckin' with Johnny 5 niggas with short circuits
R rated and stay heavily sedated
Half black and half native get pages from plays, uh
The pussy smile when you lick shots like fo' pounds
Got me wetter than the ocean, don't drown
Sex me on the average, call me mamacita
Puff reefer up in killer Cam, horse and carriage
Bastards, yell 96 backwards, shakin' our asses
And easy is not the access
Niggas ask for sex, I'm actin' deaf
Leave em' cashless, money magnet
Practice my bad habits
[Hook]
[Tiffany Johnson]
Listen, you must be gettin' me confused with chicken
Holdin' ya jewels politickin' pissin' in mouths
The obstetricians that use two fingers like Richard Nixon
Rodeo addiction, more than one position
Longer than the eye but really
Raised higher than the papa willy
Twist my nipples better than Phillies
Cop a tone, give it three rings, pick up the phone
Niggas fiend to get in my jeans like the chromosome
Check the sex, the voice ain't baritone
Shit ain't fully grown, drop me off at home
Better yet let cha' tongue roam
Ya options blown so baby stop and where we hop in the zone
Turn hard niggas, even looks can be deceivin'
Divine speakin' unleashin' vaginal secretions
The nigga hungry this evening, I'm gonna feed him
While bitches givin' and fuckin' for things ya put cha' feet in

And doin' this since Hot 97 was crisp
Now birds wanna press but I ain't with all that
Do y athing, ma no hatin' I just did all that

First mistake thinkin' I bluff then I get irrate
Ya best make side stakes, thinkin' I'ma fall

I'm the answer on the mic like A.I. on the ball
If you talkin' money I'm part of that conversation
If you talkin' funny, plannin' ya expiration
And I ain't even hak on niggas, it's just the truth
I rock with a crooked tooth

It's what I have to go downtown to the booking for
My four eyes could've saw right through her thighs
Intertwined bodies, I don't really play the party
These fraudulent niggas handshake me to death
The industry types try to mop up what's left
By the code of my dead ancestor's, no doubt
All four wheels, so we can be out
I drink the mean green six pack
And keep police back at bay
Work or play, I stay a beast
She bitin' on my ear, telling me to release
I'm for this winner's side
Straight rims and Chucka Tims
Black leather, black all weather skullies
And 20's of dro, I'd thought I'd let you know
That I'm a be here till the black wax melt

Stick it in easy, it comes back greasy
First to tell you _Slow Down_
But be the second to take you Uptown
I won't fall or fumble, trip stagger or stumble
Not a soft sucker but I still come humble
The next candidate, who holds all the weight
It ain't him or him, you better get the story straight
Ron Stud is my DJ makes the girl feel like it's foreplay
Comin like a bull, so you better yell OLE
Here is the one, I shine like the sun
You get too close, you might get done

Ain't nuttin but funky
It's just funky

The right type of hype
This how we gon' move it for the 90's and the year 2000
Check it out
Do the knowledge, this ain't no loop
This is some real live funky funky get down on the get down
And I'm flowin to this type of hype

The bass player's real, and the drummer's real

Hah!  Yeah
You know time is it (3X)
Check it check it check it out yo
Check
I beg your pardon who's the one with the roughness?
Super extra toughness, Grand Pu-ba-la!
See I'm the chosen, I keep the snakes frozen
Check out how I blows in, girl it feels good when it goes in
Here's the situation, supreme motivation
helps me get the loot, and then I knock the boots
I jump high like Jordan, Flash like Gordon
'bos, Girbauds and shorts is probably what I'm sportin
Fuck what you heard, this is what you need to hear
It's the same as last year, so _Step to the Rear_
Cause when I was a shorty couldn't wait to drink my first 40
Find an ex-shorty in the hallway and get naughty
Jump on the elevator, hit the lights out
My moms was a yardie so my pops kept a stout
Ooh a young boy tipsy, that's without a doubt
It wasn't hard to tell what the Puba was about
Love the ladies lovely used to do it on my knees
Certain honey got a problem go see Puba he can ease ya
Here I am, and here I stand
Honey all that good shit tell me, who's the man?
From, here to Bangkok, I sign my John Hancock
on the contract, it's like 1-2-3 Contact
Kick shit on the really cause I do it on the daily
Straight to the hole like my man Malik Seally
I hit stunts, on occasion smoke blunts
My moms don't like me cause I wear gold fronts
If honey wants to flam it's no thing to me at all
Alamo and Stud Doogie, it's time to have a ball
I'm a go-getter, and I'm out to go-get
If you're makin movies, CANCEL that shit
You're still makin movies?  Man, get your corder-cam
Oops, cam-corder, but shit you know the order
Couldn't get no skins, until you got a Benz
Didn't have no friends til you started makin ends
I see it daily, weekly monthly yearly
Think you got it goin on?  Really
I never sold gems to the bums in the slums
Only robbed devils, made a few number runs
Brothers round my way they like to blabber at the gums
Just jealous cause I got it by the tons
Twenty fifty hundred, is how I count my bills
Then I take it slow because it runs into the mills
Brothers try to step to this but all they catch is chills
No frills, Puba pays the bills
Ron Studda spin the wheel back like his name was Pat Sajak
on Wheel of Fortune.. that's how we keep it scorchin
Alamo HEY, Sadat X HEY, Baby Pop HEY, now let me keep it rollin
This is just the way I move to keep my pockets swollen
Lights cameras action here comes Mr. Satisfaction
I be maxin and relaxin til it's time to jump in the action
Now for grown I speak with a tone which I choose to call my own
Ghetto prone I guard the zone like the kid from _Home Alone_
Type of style that flows for days it's like it pays to save amaze
Now I be careful on the lays because the AIDS are nowadayses
Grand Puba, S.O.S., Stud Doogie, Alamo
You know how the shit go!
So Big Jeff HEY, B.R. HEY, Tislam HEY, Ja-El HEY
Stud Doogie HEY, Alamo HEY, and Uptown HEY, Brooklyn HEY
And here we go here we go make the dough yo
Here we go here we go make the dough yo
Now check it y'all I'd like to say peace
to all the Gods and the Earths and the people of the universe
Wanna let you know the black man come first
So don't act up cause you might leave in a hearse

Look deep into the eyes of your mother fuckin killer,
I want you to witness your mother fuckin murder nigga
And since you want to kill then your ass is gots to fry
But since there aint no police therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps
And if you slip I guess you sleep
You shoutin out 'fuck it' now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where i come from everyone has got a gat
And niggas try your ass to see where you got your heart at
And if your seat is flimsy then your ass is gonna bend
And like i said before therell be no tears in the end
Im rollin thru your hood and now my heart is full of anger
Your at your sister's house now ur sister's life's in danger
With the kegger
Niggas wanna bang ya
And hang ya
Stang ya with one up in the chain
Lets take a trip up Hollywood
See how many niggas in my hood
Is down the time of day
We standin up for our own shit
And if you outside the clique then you die bitch
It aint no love in this mother fucker
It aint no love for yourself or your other brother
Because we real with this shit so we stay true
And since we bang then we do what OG say do
Ive got the mind of the man in the mirror
So im lookin at me vaguely
But i cant see nothin famely
Ive got my pistol point cocked
Ring-a-ling shots non stop until i see your monkey ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit you mother fuckers know who run it
So when you put this mother fucker to the test
You have to realize somethin nigga your fuckin with the very best
Ive got this killer up inside of me
I cant talk to my mother so i talk to my diary
I goin off for the TP
I find my self face to face with my self while im sleeping
I see your picture in my head and my hands shake
You can run you can hide but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this mother fucker before he gets to me
So in your own blood youll bathe
I wont stop until I put this mother fucker in his fuckin grave
And i can say this once again
You can cry but youll still die there'll be no tears in the end.

A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
and all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
and with his help, my mother made a man of me
didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
taught me how to save my little dividends
so when I graduated I'd have a little school money
but in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
and flunked outta school with the flag pole
and left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
cause we was alone, and me I bought a death home
My real pops he broke out with the style
so I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
and ended up in a big fight
and told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
my grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
and keepin' me ain't no big deal
but now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
even though my grandfather just had a stroke
and now the money's low
and pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
and when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
so my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
and now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
she just prayin' for me heavily
take care of her grandson
and the lord must of heard her prayer
cause he made me get a grip
and got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
you couldn't have told me nothin' back then
but now I feel ya...
I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
my baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
and sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
but what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
and he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys
because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
and I don't want my son to look at life
through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
but yet and still I let my son be a kid
just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
the game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
and now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
because these years he'll remember most
so it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
but I got a buncha obstacles
if it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?""
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
because my mother knows the real deal
all these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
she's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
and biological tests can prove
you gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
but now I finally got a real daughter
no need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
you couldn't have told me nothin' back then
but now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
and got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
because we livin' in a concentration set
and everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
and judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
so I know my number's comin' up
so I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
and even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother corners tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
so united we stand but we gonna fall quick
because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
and the cops is in the same vote
just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
they shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
and now the story's all twisted up
and if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
because she left my partner's family with memories
and after hearin' this I know you don't remember me
but yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
because I know what you did was wrong
but you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
you straight up shot him from behind
but all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
you give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
but you gotta tell your story to the judge
not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
and if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
then in reality you took care of your business
but regardless I know you wanna kill me
but I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?
...yeah

Ee-eye-ee-eye - my dick
(Is he dead?)
[ VERSE 1 ]
You can run but you can't hide, I find ya
Just when you think the shit is over, I'm standin right behind ya
You crossed the wrong muthafucka, now you paranoid
Cause I'm a nigga these niggas just can't destroy
I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slackin up, I shoulda killed you from the get-go
Nigga, but this is it
We coulda talked it out like players, but now I'm on some gangsta shit
What possessed this muthafucka to try to punk me?
What possessed this muthafucka to tell me fuck me?
Guess he thinks that I'm a light weight
Hey yo, your shit's fucked up, so let me help you get your life straight
Cause niggas get they ass dunked
For fuckin with me, I ain't no muthafuckin punk
Punk, I got some good hands, but I prefer my gat
Now where you at, cause I'ma slit your Kool-Aid pack
See, niggas got it all wrong
Some niggas fake the gangsta shit, so niggas think we all songs
They come up to a muthafucka jokin, mayn
They wanna test a muthafucka's boxing game
That's when they get they ass trunked
Cause when you're fuckin with me, I'ma tear this muthafucka up
You're fuckin with a dread
You're takin 2 to your head, I'm comin fed
(Is he dead?) Yeah, he dead
""It had to be a murder""
""Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature""
""It had to be a murder""
""I looked him in the eye -
Then I shot him in his face""

See, niggas make mistakes, black
They shoot, but they don't shoot to kill, so muthafuckas stray back
But I nip it at the bud
Because I'm not down for dyin, muthafucka, so I go for blood
And let em know I'm on some real shit
Not with these fake muthafuckas on the team who won't kill shit
I scream it like I mean it
I mean it like I scream it, cause, niggas, I done seen it
Muthafuckas with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turnin the other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be runnin from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm goin for the head
Just makin sure you're dead
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""

It's over, I'm smokin on some sweet leaf
Ready to put my dick up in this bitch named Charisse cheeks
A dick-sucker's nightmare
I'm wantin some action, so I'm rollin through your hood and I be right there
I blew my horn cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fuckin this bitch and puttin her ass out
But yo, this shit is breakin up
She's tellin homie she don't wanna fuck, so homie loc is breakin up
It just so happened homie see my low
And now he's madder than a muthafucka, 'specially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, du
So I cut the shit quick
And said, ""Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to ???? over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her""
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talkin shit and wantin to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
( *shot*) And left the muthafucka stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fuckin job
So off with your head, bitch
Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm makin sure I get you good
And if you twitchin like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this muthafuckin pistol and continue squeezin
I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feelin this
But niggas ain't real with this
Cause niggaroes ain't killin shit
But yo, I guess it's dead
And I be givin you 2 to your muthafuckin head
Makin sure you're dead
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature""
This is goin out to
All those fake muthafuckas
I ain't gonna say no names
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him
Cause I'm a fuckin killer by nature""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""It had to be a murder""
""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
""You're dyin, hoe, and can't nothin save ya""

Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces
Chorus:
You must be used to all the finer thangs
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Too $hort}
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But everytime I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch
Repeat Chorus:
{Devin}
Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know thats my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces
Repeat Chorus:
{Tela}
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my suprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases
Devin:
You know what I'm saying baby
It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin Scarface in style

Deep in the mind that wide opens
Right here we stand alive, we live focused
We open-minded, still we die hopeless
With our pride broken and bullet holes covered where we stay at
And everybody's playing for keeps, most people pray that
We all make it up out this godforsaken place that we've been all faced with
We take our chances but they all wasted
And once again you see me (marching, mobbing)
But how long must I continue to see my homies dodgin these marksmen
The whole nine put on the line but never in mind to become the head sergeant
We all targets, the votes are in, but they ain't ours
We got these politicians running their game to regain power
While our whole black community sours
Crime rate towers, plagued by white powders
And they claim to helping us to clean up our community
But ain't no open opportunities, impunity
Is what these demons use to regulate
We keep in mind we can run but we can't hide cause the streets we walk are never safe
Still all my shattered hopes and dreams remain scattered
Broken into thousands of pieces, smashed and tattered
But it don't matter, hipocrisy in your democracy
Is stopping me, so I'm retaliating properly
Theologically, society has got me pressured by the hate
And Heaven knows I have faith, I have faith
(I just wanna celebrate)	--> Rare Earth
(I just wanna celebrate)
Have faith
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)

Rudely awaken from this bad dream
Thinking my conscience wants to tell me something because of these bad things
(Past things) got me in the center of these mad dreams
(Flashing) homicidal ( ? ) fatal slashings
Now I'm asking: explain to me these visionaries Brad's seen
(Past things) sad things killed him cause he had dreams
(A sad scene) but all I ever wanted was my mind back
Now I'm that nigga trying to find out where his mind's at
The time that it took myself to figure out my mind's gone
My mind crack, slide back, look at all the time gone
Rewind back, comeback, understand my life gon' make these cuts that won't change
But things look so strange, the plague
I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping 10 and flame Jane
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'ma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day
(Killer) in these dark and lonely hallways
Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every bathroom getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick
Don't watch me get gunned down for the dumb shit
Then the gun click and now I see the other side of black space
My last day, sad case, Heaven knows I have faith
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)
(I just wanna celebrate)

New day brings about change, everybody's searching for the light
The daydream schemes of living life
Has got us tossed up, believing we controlling our motions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait -

My name Brad Jordan, I don't beg pardons
Don't get me wrong I got respect for black ladies
But black hoes and ladies, ain't the same baby
And lately, I've been checkin out new prospects
And you can catch me in the projects
Huntin fo' that Next Top Model
Cute with a shape like a coke bottle, suck a dick and won't swallow
Yeah, yet that's degradin her still
To ladies, if you ain't fuckin her the next nigga will
Instead of trippin on who callin a bitch
You maybe need to focus on who fuckin his chick
If you a weak nut, we bop, never hit a G spot
Nuttin too quick and scared to play with the clit
Pullin her hair while you callin her bitch
Shit you missin the point, you need to ask what she want
(Want me to stick my finger in your booty) {OKAY~!}
You can't turn a hoe into a housewife
I don't give a fuck what she look like
She can have an ass like Buffy
and a face like Janet, head so good you can't stand it
But you still can't manage
To keep her off of them streets, cause she's skanless
Fuckin every nigga with a bankroll
How you fall in love with a stank hoe
Now you're blowin up her cell phone and she won't answer
Trippin for a dude like a dancer
And that's sick like cancer
Man this bitch is trash and he's at her
Dawg you dealin with a fucked up babe
With fucked up ways, it's fucked up but hey!
A new day, and niggaz gotta listen
And if she got some dudes that she hang with
You better watch that bitch cause she dangerous
A lady got a man at the house
A bitch got her best friend man in her mouth
And she don't give a fuck about a ring
The kid, the 15 years this brings
She'll fuck you in your house in the bed you're about
Leave the sheets full of drip stains, wash her pussy off
then bounce, now you at home with a soft dick
Feelin bad, try to shake this bitch
But you scared of the outcome, she might tell
or get drunk, feel guilty, come by and try to sell it
to your wife like it's yo' fault, duck at all costs
And if that ain't a bitch, what's a bitch, I'm lost
A hoe will jump dick to dick to get paid
But a bitch fucks yo' shit up so just wait
Cain't nobody else prosper, she live for the gossip
Hates to see the next bitch happy so she knocks her
She hates yo' man and hates yo' friends
But a bitch is a bitch is a bitch in the end
(I know you you ain't call me no bitch)
(Talkin about a ring and a dick in the mouth)
(You just a bitch-ass nigga)
(Fuck me not your wife bitch!)

(Bun B)
I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
I found out she had to told me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to G it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real
(Chorus)
I feel no pain
I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin to maintain
Cause I'm so real
(Pimp C)
We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
Cause we ain't promised tommorow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin to change from niggas to men
Chorus
(3-2)
My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin round with the fakin and hatin
I'ma blast if you run up on me
I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
if you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
don't write yo peoples locked up
Damn I miss my dog he was hog to this game
Unlike bustas these days that talk down on your name
You boys is funny
I'm bout my money
And oh so true
Mr. 3-2 when I never trusted you
I'm too real

Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
but some cry, and gets by, while others choose to wonder why..
his life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gauge
He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit, but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive, but hey
I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
He had a baby that he couldn't raise
and she will never see her father again, cause he's in a grave
I always think about ??
""My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer""
How will the family explain it?
""My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!""
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls
Just the thought of a kid livin fly fucks me up
when his girl has to raise a BASTARD child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater
She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it
The situation's got me guessin..
but the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die
..
[Scarface]
It was crazy how it happened
Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin
All I could see was a pistol spittin rounds
and the boy was just screamin as he fell to the ground
A woman yelled - get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest, and one to his head
He just laid there in silence..
and all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up..
followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher..
but if he survives, I'm willin to betcha
he'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the Northside
Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by ?? on Scott Street
School was lettin out,
""Yo you ain't gonna shoot yet?""  ""WATCH ME!""
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun..
.. he shot him
Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother
Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, ""Why you do it?""
""Why you shot his moms Jay?  Shit""
""Hehehehehe.. hah man fuck that bitch""
Went to the store to use the payphone
Called up Mack, ""Aiyyo J.D. homey""
Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Headin for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything
He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat
He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggaz all strapped out of one house
That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray,
and a second to die

P-P-P, knuckleheads on parole without a GED

(Bla bla...) I strip ya down to ya optimo, cigars
I pull cards like Vegas
Clap my hands then walk away from the table with ya payment
(How I'm paid?) Niggaz are barely a village
I spit with a foul mouth like Terrance & Phillip
A man or gorilla (ahh ahh) my cap toot back like Fred
So white bitches jump on my +Limp Bizkit+ and yell
""You niggaz know you can't fuck around""
Haha yeah, you see me, you be duckin up and down
(Yo yo yo) Super Lex, cop a thing-thing
Guzzle it down with two bottle of Ginseng
Fuck ya brains out hold when Al Green sings
When your out cold, bitch steal ya bling bling
You died for ya mom and pop, don't sweat it
I got the next bitch rockin ya birthday present
News at 11, Scarface and Doc
From Bricks to South Park we say, ""FUCK THE COPS!!""

As I, bring it to ya one more time
From a state where we stole weight, and dough mind dine
And we don't tote six-shooters, we tote glock nines
And we don't smoke a peace pipe, we smoke fat dimes
It's a place where it's a common site to see the 5-0
Hit the other side of sixteen and getcha mind blown
Fo sho', it's a different vibe from being downtown
then when ya come into the ghetto and ya can't come back out
I seen the ghetto shut down, seen niggaz shot up
Seen niggaz get knocked the fuck out and never got up
The neighborhood paralyzed, crack drive-bys
It's evident we hurt, you ignored our cry
On the outside the ghetto just another mindstate
And import more minorities to help the crime rate
I ain't lookin for a job, fuck workin the part-time
when we could come up on some dough, with good combs and slang dimes
I see this all the Goddamn time - it's fucked up and it's the truth
Nevermind the shooter on the roof
It's a war goin on right here, where we at
I can't complain about what I can't change, so why dap?
Dropped outta high school in tenth grade so I rapped
But still, can't seem to get this monkey off my back
Fuck it, I pulled a few moves and ride for the streets
And when I start to feel like this, don't fuck with me!
[Hook]

Yo, Young Noble Outlaw, spittin shit with 'Face and Red
Bear looped out flows and you can taste the wet

You say Nob' got a old soul, blame the vets

Burnt shit from the fingertips, able to spray
Nigga ya mind playin tricks on you
Ya drew down, but ya nine won't spit for you
And ain't nobody got no hostle clips for you
You in the mix but ain't nobody doin shit for you
It's gon' be Hell for hustler, while your neck spoil you
With the same clip you had last week
and niggaz know I know the real, that's why the fag don't speak
And I ain't even peak yet, without the heat yet
Holla my street yet, cuz I be the beef yet
I'm hittin these niggaz hard, I ain't even eat yet
or felt defeat yet, I melt the weak yet
Lyrical breathe death - we thugs nigga what

You a Snitch Nigga, specializin' at bumpin' ya gums

Snitch Nigga, ain't you tired of running your mouth

That's why I don't mess with friends
Unless it's my Mac-10
I'm the king of the ghetto, Z-Ro the crooked in the flesh
Looking for head shots, cuz bitch fellas get the bullet-proof vests
What you scared for?
What happened to all the tough ass talk
The way you was bumpin', I thought you had a taste for asphalt
Look at momma's baby out here starvin' for his ass
Whippin', chiefin', with a magician then drippin' out his ass, listen
I'll be damned if I pull a rabbit out a hat
Well pull my 40 out of holster, and do this snitch fella on his back
WHOA!, look how I handled this .44
My conscience be screaming Z-Ro Murder Mo!, Murder Mo!
And these snitch fellas on 'How I'm Living' try snitchin' on 'BET'

Got no time for all that yesterday, he say, she say
Pull out da beat tape

My eyes are tight and shinin'cuz I'm smokin' some kill
Don't look at me, go buy some drinks, call up some hoes if you will

I'm in the nigga's mouth after all them bitches and cowards
With the East coast flow, West coast body language
Don't know nothin' bout da South and tryin' to find someone to hang wit
Man when ya finish flowin' or whatever da fuck you doin'
Holla at me, I'll be in da bathroom boo boo'n

So I bought a 59 and got behind da wheel
Scooped up a fat sack of kill cuz I'll be drivin' a while
Takin' two or three pulls every five or six miles
I can't wait to see my roaddogg, you how we do it
Just like a case of beer, piece of cock, we run right through it
And all da bitches know me, I hit quite a few
They be glad to see me, niggaz don't give'em dick like I do
I bust bout two, then they tell they friends, and then I'm in
Wit my French tickler, makin' they pussy lips grin
But there's always one in da crowd, talkin' loud
Found out I fucked her cousin, now she runnin' her mouth
Leavin' notes on my windshield, I'm a bitch, I'm a hoe
Early in da mornin' bitches knockin' at my mama doe
Mama please, when you finish whatever that you doin'
Who ever that is, tell'em I'm in da bathroom boo boo'n

He said came up on a lick and he was glad that he foind me
He had some niggaz wit him, full of drink and lookin' sweaty
Cockin' gats back talkin' bout ""C'mon Dee man you ready?""
Its a house down da street, about two does down
They sell weed and they least got two whole pound
Man all we gots to do is hit this ride, we kool
Lets fuck his wife and take his weed and bust on that fool
We can all come up, whatever we get, we split
Ain't nobody sayin' nothin', ain't nobody seen shit
So lets pile up five deep in ya lac
He'll know that it is you Dee and won't think its da jack
Man you must be smokin' crack, you don't know who dat is

Cause thats the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch

But theres a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin out winnin
100,000 in the case now I'm comin out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 12 gauge went ""BOOM"" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move

Forgive me Lord, thank the Lord I'm alive
Cause I'm knowin deep down I coulda died
I shed so many tears lost so many peers
In the grave or the penitentiary facin 20 years
Pourin beers on the corner, cause Frankie told me {?} lonely
I was high livin blind to the fact that they sold us out
America the Beautiful, there's a funeral
on every day of the month, tryin to get our knees up
Huh, it's another chance under these circumstances

But he knew, to get off in this crew, he had to change
So when James went to church this nigga did the same
So he's steppin back away from the cut
But his vengeance of livin, had his braincells start to fuck up
Steady callin his shots, but steady leavin a trail
So sit back peep my game, I got a story to tell
I came from a gang with niggaz who do crime
They didn't rat they niggaz out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self
[Scarface]
He gettin clean, so we gave him a job
Had the whole entire city on they knees, recognizin the mob
Took the cash that he was makin, in this seat
And compared it, to the cash off in these God-damn streets
As luck gon' be, the scales didn't break even
So now he's out to go an get the cash that he needin
Some wise man once told me
(?) but I didn't believe him, so he showed me
Gave an example; the piece of a pie
Said if you eat to much it's gone at the blink of an eye
This for these niggaz out here hearin me
Hypothetical conversation, the rest of that shit, is a conspiracy
I got the word and heard he back on the grind
Ran across and met a nice spot, runnin his mob
I love the nigga, so I gave him some dap
He said he loved my work efforts,
and he said he liked the way that I rapped
Wanted to show me what he was rollin outside, but
Little did I know, he was the FBI
I heard a rumor that this nigga got knocked...
A few months past and he was back on the lot
and shift the plot, I'll teach you niggaz conspiracy theories
I spit this shit in code, but I pray that you hear me
Cuz see he know him and, he meets you
They get popped and, you do to
Illegal taps and undercover surveillance
Tapin conversations, tryna duck the years that he facin
[short phone conversation]
Better yet gonna get me facin, cuz we know he's the back-
bone - if ya crush the bone, ya alter the mind
And thought process is vital at this time
And I heard, you was out to get the niggaz that's rich
But I'ma tell you motherfuckers like this
I came from a gang with niggaz who do crime
They didn't rat they niggaz out when they came to do time
No snitchin nobody out when ya facin a life sentence
For death, you do it by yo God-damn self
[repeat]
[Scarface]
How the fuck is you gon' stop a train
You set your fires on your forest to burn it but then it rains
It's like Babyface and them Jay
We all got lies and RAM, you motherfuckers own they grave
We need current situations, in due time
Train 'em to do the business in 20 years down the line
So I stand firm on ""We can't be stopped""
Reconcile our disagreements, and I'm still down with Rap-A-Lot
Murder ya boxers tryna break apart what God made
And regardless to what you boys say
Seek and destroy, fuck the opposition
When you for real it's in yo bloodline, not in yo motherfuckin mind
So feel it like the holy spirit, and remember
when ya face to face with the demons, you can't fear it
You fight until the battle finished
No matter what the end is, when you attack you strike with vengeance
And always judge a man by his deeds
and never buy jealousy cuz it breathes...
Conspiracy theory...

Yo anybody seen my diary? Oh there it is.
I gotta write this shit down. Check it out.
Dear Diary, I'm having a little problem
I cant make it by myself maybe you can help me solve em
I'm confused and I dont know what to do
I'm hoping you can help me cause there's no one else to talk to
I want to die, but it ain't for me
I try to talk to my dad, but my old man ignores me
He says I'm delirious
And I drink too much, so he doesnt take me serious
But little does he know I'm really losing it
I got a head, but aint no screws in it
I be thinking deep
Thats one of the reasons at night I cant sleep
I thought it would change when I was older
But even now I'm still peeping over my shoulder
Theres your life after death too
And what about the man with the cane and the black suit?
And what about cancer?
Too many motherfucking questions, and not enough answers
Aint no use in trying
We might as all face it we were all born dying
Theres a black book in Brad's hands
And its the diary of a madman
(chorus)
Dear diary today I hit a nigga with a torch
Shot him on his face and watched him die on his front porch
Left his family heartbroken
Flashbacks of him laying there bleeding with his eyes open
I cant put the shit behind me
I'm know I'm here somewhere, but I cant find me
I used to be a drug dealer
On the for reala, now I'm a born killer
And it aint no changing me
It used to be hard, but now it aint no thing to me
To go up to a niggas house
Put a pistol in his mouth, and blow his fucking brains out
No doubt if you cross then I'ma take ya
Cause I'm a fucking killer by nature
You got an M11, bring your weapon
Huh, I got an AK-47
It's gonna be a bloody Sunday
Cause your fucking with a nigga like Bundy
And I was taught not to kill
Like a Vietnam vet with a thousand yard stare
So welcome to the slaughterhouse nigga
Redrum and I'ma be the grave digger
And if you want to cap, come cap me
I'm trigger happy like my great-grandpappy
Just watch for the chrome in my right hand
My second entry from the diary of a madman
(Chorus)
Dear diary, help me cause I'm frantic
S-sometimes I think I'm going schizophrantic
The world's looking dark for instance
Maybe cause I'm looking from a distance
But then again I wear a blindfold
Staring at the motherfucking world with my eyes closed
To myself I'm a stranger
Walking in the foot steps of danger
It's a long path ahead of me
I gotta get somewhere cause everybody here is scared of me
I had a job but they fired me
My wife walked out now I'm living in my diary

Hopeless again, and the more I stick around the shit get more fucked up
That's why I'm back on Holloway gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' back on how it used to be when it was all good
We wasn't trippin', this was our hood
I had your motherfuckin back
And when it was time to go to war, it was like ""where these niggaz at?""
Fuck rackets, we ain't never been the type to hold out
Or, let a motherfucker show out
No doubt, we put it down for the 9-0-triple 4
Droppin tops, fuckin fine hoes
These other niggaz is finally catching up
Listening to rappers ballin and gettin touched
Wasup? You done forgot about the street rules, splurgin
Is you a motherfucking fool?
Money ain't a thing to a nigga out here rappin
But to a nigga out there cappin?
That's they downfall

Now the whole neighborhood silent
Got the fed-e-rals hangin (Shhhh)
While these young niggaz steady sangin
I need a motherfuckin law-uh-yer (Why's that?)
I'm in a state of paranoia
How many niggaz in the six-by-six
Fin' to get, some time behind some loud mouth bitch
Fin' to snitch, trapping niggaz up in they downfalls
Taping motherfuckers phone calls
Ay, I've been in this shit for two deep
From moving ki's, pushing weight was too sweet
An 8-ball will cost you 75 (Dirt cheap)
Back in the game that shit was live
And all you had to do to survive was get a whole click
Of niggaz, down with they business and stack chips
Savin up for hard times
Do the time when you do the crime
You niggaz tryin to ? your downfall
(Chorus)
(Voice with effects)
Nothing lasts forever but love
Money comes and goes
But for those ?? it surely goes
[Scarface]
You rollin over in the joint, trying to get your time dropped
Puttin niggaz up forever, cause you did the crime hop
Turned fed, and know they got indictments for real
Runnin in niggaz houses, niggaz fighting appeals
Offering 50 years to innocent motherfuckers
All because of the game, niggaz run outta hustle
Feds be showin pictures, you got to give 'em somethin
Time make a nigga forget it and start bumping
And saying shit, jeopardizing the whole thang
Niggaz run out of freedom, niggaz start to sang (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
yeah)
Laughing in your face, chuckle and produce
Avoid they conversation, them niggaz the dudes, fool
[Chorus]
[Outro - spoken as Chorus repeats]
Thing is, when a motherfucker is doing dirt
Don't come moving it, ya know what I mean
Ya know, that won't get you no Rolls Royces and shit like mine baby

Where my motherfucking kids at  bitch

Hey  today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner  hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(now where's she staying?) She must be new in the hood
But I aint trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
Aint a damn thing changed , aint no shame in my game
She said, "" Used to go Thomas""
I slowed my rope, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where you headed, she said ""Going to work""
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinink, ""Going to flirt""
My homies women aint no thing to me,
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore she was peepin' my ride
Convertible, 64, with the ride inside
Super clean with the discus in full
Higher than the fucks spittin' this to ho's:
(CHORUS)Please excuse my attitude,
Sorry if Im being rude, but I've got something to say to you
Hoping you wont lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me,
You can spend the day with me
And we can ride and see the sights
Its going down tonight . . .
Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day
Gave the bitch a call and she hung up in my face
Now thats the pits
She didnt have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
And haven't called her for 3 months
I guess they send me to be doggin' a chic
Can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let he take a ride with the braster
It cool, dont front ..ooooh, no sex
No sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And firthermore, we can get to those
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to ho's:
CHORUS
Now cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferari, now I'm back in the coup, I knocked her boots-
Your baby's mama put me to work
I dragged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
She got the (front and back , side to side)
Back and forth with the gangster glide
Started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day
She was asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now thats sick)And plus she got you staying at home
With the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you down in the brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
So player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'benz spitting this to ho's:

Dollar...
I'm bout my game
Can't take shit light
Rich today
Be broke tonight
I duck the pin
Cuz I seek the light
On my grind
My grind's my life
My life's my hood
My home is slums
My boys is deep
Hoes is young
Funk is here
I'm out the way
I stash the cash
For that rainy day
Those days to come
My storm awaits
I save for now
For babenapes
For cars and wheels
For grills and chains
For cows and bulls
For screens and bang
For candy paint
My life done changed
My kids is grown
I needs the bank
My bank foreal
I leaves behind
A name that lives
For years uhuh
Chorus
Big weed and drink
Rims and candypaint
Fresh shoes and clothes
Keep several hoes
Y'all idolize
Me, I do it for the dollar
Girls slide down the pole
Niggas trick for hoes
We sell tons of dope
I ain't never broke
Ain't my fault that the world revovles the dollar
I dips to clubs
Gets major play
From major hoes
In a major way
Short skirts and boots
Thick ass with thighs
She said it's yours
Come fuck me eyes
Got hoes with jobs
Got hoes with games
Got freaky hoes
That dance with hey
They likes my style
And I like they ways
She wants what's mine
And I want what pays
I love these hoes
Without my heart
I fucks they mind
Not private parts
They falls in lust
Dick game in truth
She leaves her man
Cuz I keeps her loose
She dreams of me
Just met the chick
She mean to you
Cuz you stressed the bitch
I takes her home
You sweat the shit
She rolls her eyes
Like the exorcist
Chorus
It's in my blood
Been real for deep
Ain't changed a bit
I claim the streets
I've left the hood
But made it back
Sold cocaine
Smoked and i jacked
Prophets from crack, bought cockpits and gats
Bulldogs and hogs
My life I rap
Put down in words
Dope fiends in packs
My block I love
And they love me back
Homeboys is feudin'
Got hate for none
I rise foreal
I stay with guns
I sleep alone
Cuz I trust myself
Respect for all
But I deals in death
That's real in depth
Can't bite my tongue
I speaks my mind
That's where I'm from
That's how I'm raised
I'm cut from that
That's how I'm made
Can't fuck with that

Trouble seems to catch a motherfucker with his cards down
Gotta keep my drawers up, shit's gettin hard now
These motherfuckin cops be plantin shit on these niggas
Simply because these niggas got bank accounts that's bigger
I just can't get no peace from you motherfuckin rollers
Everytime I pull my Benz-o out, you pull me over
I'm sick of motherfuckers who be jocking Whitey's coattails
Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me 'bout my dope-sales
Niggas just take your cut and get your ass up out my face
The only thing you probably get from me is a cock-sucking pistol case
Unless you plan on plantin a lil' somethin in my shit
Just because you ain't got shit, bitch!
Give em a badge and a trigger and that makes em figure
That they can fuck with a million dollar nigga
They got you mixed up, fixed up at the Segas, shookin Indo
Gettin fucked up in the gank-hole
The only way you'll whip that motherfucker is when you whip that motherfucker
And we choke the motherfucker (Man, fuck that motherfucker!)
So when you hear my song and wanna get it on
You better come prepared motherfucker, you dyin wit'cha boots on

Niggas gettin caught, doin time, so they snitchin
They pickin niggas up on a funky ass suspicion
We'll be goin down for some questioning we think
And end up gettin hit with the fuckin kitchen sink
Racketeer and laundering, Kingpin wondering
If they got some unsolved murders, then give him some of them
Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
We'll sell each other out, and start rattin' on our partners
They start bringin up shit that happened back in '85
And then comes the largest jury, bitch, they fuckin time!
You might as well play the state cause you gon' do day for day
And sellin out your homeboys ain't the shit
Cos y'all gonna have to die in this bitch, bitch!

Deep in the mind that wide opens
Right here we stand alive, we live focused
We open-minded, still we die hopeless
With our pride broken and bullet holes covered where we stay at
And everybody's playing for keeps, most people pray that
We all make it up out this godforsaken place that we've been all faced with
We take our chances but they all wasted
And once again you see me (marching, mobbing)
But how long must I continue to see my homies dodgin these marksmen
The whole nine put on the line but never in mind to become the head sergeant
We all targets, the votes are in, but they ain't ours
We got these politicians running their game to regain power
While our whole black community sours
Crime rate towers, plagued by white powders
And they claim to helping us to clean up our community
But ain't no open opportunities, impunity
Is what these demons use to regulate
We keep in mind we can run but we can't hide cause the streets we walk are never safe
Still all my shattered hopes and dreams remain scattered
Broken into thousands of pieces, smashed and tattered
But it don't matter, hipocrisy in your democracy
Is stopping me, so I'm retaliating properly
Theologically, society has got me pressured by the hate
And Heaven knows I have faith, I have faith

Have faith

Rudely awaken from this bad dream
Thinking my conscience wants to tell me something because of these bad things

(Flashing) homicidal ( ? ) fatal slashings
Now I'm asking: explain to me these visionaries Brad's seen
(Past things) sad things killed him cause he had dreams
(A sad scene) but all I ever wanted was my mind back
Now I'm that nigga trying to find out where his mind's at
The time that it took myself to figure out my mind's gone
My mind crack, slide back, look at all the time gone
Rewind back, comeback, understand my life gon' make these cuts that won't change
But things look so strange, the plague
I gots to get myself up out the frame
Try to maintain the same game flipping 10 and flame Jane
A damn shame, people gots to always check your background
To jack now, come jack now and I'ma leave you flat down
Come back now or back down, homie, this is always all day
(Killer) in these dark and lonely hallways
Cause all they wanna see is all us brothers boxed up in caskets
With plastic bags in every bathroom getting blasted
It's drastic, mama help me calm down cause your son's sick
Don't watch me get gunned down for the dumb shit
Then the gun click and now I see the other side of black space
My last day, sad case, Heaven knows I have faith

New day brings about change, everybody's searching for the light
The daydream schemes of living life
Has got us tossed up, believing we controlling our motions
Got the answer in space beside the view behind the ocean
And adapting to the everyday struggle's got us stressed
Cause the fact we know we here one day and could die the next
You've insisted to take equipment to the solar system
Trying to ensure your sole existence
Now tell me: do you think that when the bang goes boom
You can pack up all your things and aim for the moon?
It's unlikely, but you might be equipped with with proceeds to save lives
But you die when the King say die
You can race it but you can't shake it, stop trying
Try to hide it, cause you can't face it but you're born dying
God, please forgive us cause we're human not perfect
And the devil try to fronting but it's not working
How can we all sit suspended in space
Just spinning in place and ain't extended in faith
Man, wait -

I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
had to find my place
But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
had to dodge a case
Had to dodge a bullet
And the nigga that tried to pull it
The streets is throwed
If I don't get lean and blowed everyday
I feel just like I'ma explode on overload and overdrive
All my life this drive I tried
I seen a lot of good niggas die
Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
Or somebody's a bitch
I wish I could change the past
But I gots to live in the present and pray
that tomorrow this shit don't last, I'm livin to fast
Shit, my momma asked me who I was like she ain't know me
But, to tell the truth I didn't know myself
I found out she had to told me
Just to show me just how good I had it
I guess I couldn't see it
Mild-mannered I just couldn't be it
But that was just the way we used to G it
One of the wrongest niggas I see
Or one of the strongest niggas I know
Walkin on my tippy-toe cause the life I live ain't long and I know
So I put weed in the bong and I blow
Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
Child that grew into a man that's widely respected
Too real

I feel no pain
I can't complain
Stuck in the game
Tryin to maintain
Cause I'm so real

We blow big everyday
But that don't stop our pain
Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
Got niggas doin 40
When you 25 that's life
I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
These bitch ass niggas shife
Niggas might snitch out they momma
That's why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
Cause we ain't promised tommorow
But nigga you promised to die
Nigga can't you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
At night I talk to God and try to understand
How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
I guess they already gone, ain't nothin gone bring them back
So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
I still love my piece of change, wood grain and big head ones
But I had to realize in life everything ain't always fun
I guess that's true for some
But them hoes will never win
Out here just hustlin and grindin
Tryin to change from niggas to men

My nigga you a ho to me
Boy you done went off on me
Runnin round with the fakin and hatin
I'ma blast if you run up on me
I'ma do my dirt by my lonely so that nobody can snitch
This matter coulda been resolved
if you woulda came clean and paid my shit
See niggas disrespect the game but boy you'll never last
Pullin that ho shit sellin your partner out for a piece of ass
And fool you claim you real but really need to be shot up
No respect for your family that's dead
don't write yo peoples locked up

(The fast dough) Cos see don't nothin move but the flow  really doe
I kid you not  I'm real with dis
Havin skrilla is the only way to deal with this
If it ain't green  it ain't me  that's no goddamn lie
Well show me big skrill and I will get live
Give up the loochie, I need it in a major way
Now gimme all (all), I gots ta have it (everyday)
It's my world, the only mom, I'm stressed, that'll make you
break you, if it's really real then I'll take you
Shake you for the dollar bill let's see
You're outta here (smoked on the fuckin concrete)
Chorus:
Skrillaaaaaaaaaa - Got me crazy, skrilla got me gone
Skrillaaaaaaaaaa - got me flippin new Cadillac chromes
Skrillaaaaaaaaaa - got me crazy, skrilla got me mad
Cos skrilla gives me from riches to rags (motherfucker)
Verse 2: Scarface, Facemob
It ain't nuttin but the cash flow game
How long can you last 'fore you're down to your very last change, nigga?
(Money makes the world go round) Tell em again y'all
(Money makes the world go round) (*My God*)
Forty, fifty grand a night, that's what I'm seein

Baller, called a, million dollar nigga

And no I don't shoot, I swoop in my Coupe
Skrilla for realla my nigga, so whatcha wanna do?
Do you want to fuck around with my crew? Do you

Stay in you, don't have enough to attend to the menu
So come and let me single, continue (everybody sayin)
To make money money money, make money money money (yeah)

Take money money money, take money money money
So can you please make the cheque out to the Facemob
Check it
Now one, two, three to the fo', like
rippin million dollars in my hand, tight
Facemob rule number one thing (what?)
Skrilla, nuttin but skrilla's the way to maintain
Us both, have got to keep the skrill between

Really doe, from town to town we puts it down
As I, hold it down, game tight, right
Now Miss Crabtree (Crabtree), I know that you are mad at me
To find out that it was your money (money)
that I spent and now girl, it's all gone
(It's what?) It's all gone
It's gone like riches to rags, dishes to bags

And we about to come up as we put the shit down
Hold up, don't rush, cos I'm good ta gets mine
If it wadn't for bad, I'd have no up than luck
Smokin plank of man, who gives a motherfuck!!!!
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
Scam my wife when I'm not home
Bitch I'm gone, tryin ta come back phat
Facemob where ya at? (Right behind ya and we strapped)
Strapped with straps and all eyes on paper
And most importantly you keep your mind on papin
And you can have it all, if you can take your money pieces at a time
but you can't take your pieces outta mine
Big wine, it's all about the dollar sign
I'm, flippin in the big Dawg, continental flyin
Tryin to stack it to the ceilin on you home's
Cos bitches got me cummin but skrilla got me goin
Chorus:
Skrillaaaaaaaaaa - got me crazy, skrilla got me goin
Skrillaaaaaaaaaa - got me flippin new Cadillac chromes
Skrillaaaaaaaaaa - bought me houses, skrilla bought me clothes
Skrilla got me flippin in a Rolls

Man I met this chick so fine
So bad She made me sick some time
I just had to fuck this bitch one time
I met her in the galleria shopping, buying
Gifts for some guy that she dating, still shot
Second anniversary and I'm congratulating that
But man she had an ass so fat
You couldn't palm it with Shaquille hands
It seems to me she had the whole world in her pants
Walked behind her whispering love songs
She started smiling so I handed her this bathing suit
And told her try it
Replied, while with these light brown eyes
I'm shopping for a lady friend about your size
She put it on so I paid for
Then I told her she could keep it
And then I walked out the store, it's our secret
But peep it
Made it down the hall, she came running
Bags about to bust, blouse wrinkled, but still stunning
I don it
Made a mack move and girl chased me
And shortly thereafter, exchanged our fuck faces
It's tasteless
But honey must of missed being treated
Like something more than niggas just tumbling and dudes beating
Her ass behind the silly shit
And I can see it in her eyes she was sick of this
Let's see the sights, its me tonight
Let's leave him stuck home pacing
Blowing up your pager, exchanging fuck faces
Chorus:
You must be used to all the finer thangs
Infatuated by what money brangs
It seems to me you hoes will never change
So all that's left is for us to exchange
{Too $hort}
I called her up on the phone said I'll be there in a Minute
Cause all them faces she be making when I'm in it
They make a nigga feel like he doing something
The pussy so good have you through with money
But you ain't knowing she's a tramp and a slut and all That shit
Every chance you get you trying to call that bitch
Quite a few niggas got the pussy
But everytime I see her got to stop and look
Cause she so damn fine bitch
I want to make you mine bitch
I want to fuck one time bitch
Short Dogg's on your mind bitch
I give a fuck about any nigga you fuck with
Stuck with, I love the way she suck dick
It make me bust this
It's hard to hold back when it's this good
You said she wouldn't I knew the bitch would
Cause I'm a veteran, twist them in the game so fast
With this pimping, bitch, you ain't go last
I got to get 'em, let 'em know I'm pimping really
Unless I'm getting paid, the shit is temporary
Exchanging fuck faces, making hella noise
Getting freaky as fuck and go and tell my boys
Cause It's like that, that's how we do this shit, Bitch
Repeat Chorus:
{Devin}
Let me holla at 'cha B, Short check this
Just got through fuckin this bitch, who swallowed my Cum and drank my
piss
I stuck my fist up in her cock, she didn't budge or Move it
Sucking and Fucking, man she loved to do it
I bust 4, 5, 6
nuts in her mouth, when she come to my house
I know thats my bitch
And she don't tell nobody shit
She keeps it cool, she said that pussy's mine
And because the way I rhyme, she let me fuch her all The time
I'm thinking about keeping this bitch by my sidee
Girl so fine niggas dreamed they fucked her and lied
But I'm numero uno, the one and onlly
Bitch be all on me chewing my nuts like bologna
Then picked, she licked on my dick like plop
The nut skeeted out like thick white snot
She saw it was still hard and said look what I got
Then rubbed it, hugged, it and shoved it in her cock
Tried to tell her to stop, but the bitch wouldn't listen
I guess a dick that's hard as rock, is what these hoes Be missing
And in return she used her stolen credit cards to by Me casing
And later on she got this bone and gives me fuck Faces
Repeat Chorus:
{Tela}
I got a call from Laquesha and some of her neices
Saying its about six or seven dime pieces
We can hook up with no chains and no leashes
Tied to this fucking affair and slow leases
See what we go do is fall through with crushed ice
Man these hoes been talking bout fuckin for three Nights
Whole damn grill so slick it's kind of nice
Not too expensive, but comfortable and its quiet
The rimmy that she gimme, a phillie and its tranquilized
Thinking to myself at this time and realized
She ain't got on panties so damn it, its in the signs
Somebody's getting fucked tonight to my suprise
Enter the room with the cat ass eyes
Rochelle's who do nails with them thick ass thighs
See I love these kind cause they ain't with that Bullshit
Get a nigga off in the room and pull shit
Girl stop licking right there you killing me
Go ahead and touch it right there and fell the P
This some cold blooded shit with a bitch you let me Sit through
Damn hoe I must admit, that's whit it hit me
So I dips into the world of forgotten fuck faces
You getting buck places, drinking, love, and sex Chases
Devin:
You know what I'm saying baby
It's either now or never
Too $hort, Tela, Devin Scarface in style

Fears weightless, I fear none in the physical form
Let us face, nigga, you cant do me no harm
Up here shakin, wishin me well, but deep in you heart
You wantin me close to make sure I dont ease in the dark
And squeeze wit thought, and leave you with the hole in your head
For wantin me dead, but I come to watch you suffer instead
Like burnin your bed, cuz I dont want your blood on my hands
Thats not in my plan, to unstrap it and murda ya man, I murda ya man
And i go home and got your blood on my clothes, and i'll be guilty
But werent you the one who stepped on my toes, So I aint guilty
At least thats how I see it inside, an eye for an eye
He challenge me and he gotta die, so I send him a kite
To let him know that wasnt right, and he in my sight
And I cant let him leave in the night, and he seein his life
Flashin right in front of his face, for fuckin wit face
This what you get for fuckin wit face

Open your eyes, cuz seein is believin my nigga
And stop breathin and now your ass is leavin my nigga
Protectin your chest, believin you put life in this bitch

Break it down for me
What you want me to do, What you want me to do
What you want me to do, What you want me to do
I got in-trouble rhymes to adapt to in-trouble times
A double nine, in case niggas get out of line
And heaven knows that I done tried to change but in the midst
Of tryin to be a better me, trouble was all i could seem to see
And the facts that I know tomorrow aint promised to be
So from this day forth, Ima be all that I can be
When my cousin turned his back on me, I had to be my own man
Regardless of what the stakes was, Ima play my own hand
And im tired of bein let down be my so called friends
And regardless of the bloodshedin, aint no  tears in the end
Father please forgive me for im sinnin, forgive us all
But I aint to blame, the lunatics were in my heart
And I think I need to build another wall
Cuz I dont want the world to see me
Cuz lately these niggas been tryin ta eat me
Im exhausted and my body sleepy, But at lest its hard to rest
Im a nervous reck, I walk with stress
I used to walk around with a tech, but nowadays I be like fuck it dawg
You fuck wit me I gots to fuck wit yall
And revenge is just another word for payback
Payin you back today for this grudge that I had for you way back
You niggas knew I wouldnt play that
I sent you bitches to the morgue with two holes in your head, no remorse
Why you think my niggas call me the boss
Cuz I be dressed up in designer suits
And for the fact that these niggas know that im the truth
And i always look a man in his eyes before I shoot
And when he disrespect this man of respect, there aint no excuse
I call on the troops, and put them dead on your case
For fuckin wit face, this what you get for fuckin wit face
(chorus)
Open your eyes, cuz seein is believin my nigga
And stop breathin and now your ass is leavin my nigga
Protectin your chest, believin you put life in this bitch

(scarface)
This nigga tried to hit me yo, but he killed one of my people tho
So now I got to get this ho, they say revenge is expensive so I
Chartered a plane and I hit the coast, when i ran across this kid I know
We spoke briefly but we spoke in code
Tryin deeply to destroy his soul
I keep it real cuz the streets is watchin me
??? cuz the beats is jockin me
And all in all it was a smooth ride
Except for when this dude tried to hand me this conspiracy
See, I pimp the game like its a prostitute
And i wont stop until i clock the loot
Misunderstand me and i cock and shoot
Plus, I done learned what to do and what not to do
(chorus) (x2)
Open your eyes, cuz seein is believin my nigga
And stop breathin and now your ass is leavin my nigga
Protectin your chest, believin you put life in this bitch

You can call me T double o to the L-o-double - yo
I'm 2Low, that funky little niggaroe
Comin back with a brand new cut
And you can new jack swing on MY nuts
Cause I got the shit so tight
A young nigga doin damage to the mic (you sho' right)
I'm 13, but I ain't dumb
So bring it on if you muthafuckas want some
Cover your dome because it's on once again
And I'm a young nigga that's known to win
I got my street sense from these muthafuckin streets, bitch
And I'm comin real, cause I ain't fuckin with that weak shit
Pass me the joint and let me kick it for the old folks
All the O.G.'s back in the hood that once sold dope
Jammin ??? I'm leavin on the next train
Runnin the game, so when I'm gone I be set, mayn
Got a bank account, so I can stack some g's
And have nice things like Cutlass on d's
Fresh candy paint, chicken shit live
And fuckin with this whip before I'm old enough to drive
My teacher can't stand me cause I give him no respect
I ain't sayin ""M'am, yes M'am"" until you're signin me a check
So you can miss me with that muthafuckin bum shit
I'm gettin paid makin maze, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't my mother and I ain't your fuckin son
So in reality, bitch, you gets none

Here we go once again with the real shit
Throw your hands in the air if you can feel this
I bring styles after styles after styles, dukes
I can't be faded with the shit, cause I'm a young troop
I sport them Nikes, not the Reeboks or K-Swiss
And while I'm on the subject of feet, let me say this
I kick ass like I'm Bruise Lot
And let me squash this shit: real niggas do die
Give it to me, baby, let me show you what that Deuce like
Let me hit the swisher and let me show you what my juice like
Rippin up shit in '93 like a chainsaw
Makin niggas say, ""Goddamn, that little nigga raw!""
And I can square the shit off right
I'm straight from ?Warm Cloth? where these niggas don't fist-fight
They got they muthafuckin pistols shootin shit up
Tust enough to get your punk ass lit up
It's not about the set I claim, cause I don't bang
I'm just a nigga from the hood who let his nuts hang
And I can give a muthafuck about a nigga if he's bigger

I passed the forty to my partner, now he's ready to roll

Knockin niggas on they ass like we Evander Holyfield

And the funky little nigga is who this muthafuckin song's for
Once upon a time there lived Lucky
Lucky got fucked because Lucky tried to fuck me

He came up short, then he got his ass sidekicked
Had to cut him up like a tractor
Pick-pick-pick muthafucka, I holler atcha

Roamin' in my muthafuckin' hood and thangs
Seems to me my mutherfuckin' hood done changed
Cause niggas used to kick it with the rival gangs
But now we gots to deal with them survival thangs
.45 in my lap when I'm on the creep
Niggas livin' shife, so I roll one deep
Cause now they see me flippin' in the 1-9-9-4

And now they lookin' at me crazy
But off-brand niggas can suck a dick because they can't fade me

And we gon' show you what we mean by funk
Muthafucka, you ain't see my trunk

Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
Scope a 40 bag and we hit the spot
Put my shit in park and got up under the tree
Pull the swishers out and gave the ganja to 3
Rapped us up a fattie and we started to smoke
Eyes gettin' red cause we higher than coke
A nigga chillin' cause it's all good
And we ain't trippin' on the bullshit, nigga, because we all hood
But other niggas don't wanna see it that way
But all I got to say is: you don't wanna see that S.A.
Because we're all upon a mission
Killin don't make us no different
And dyin don't make it no different

Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
Scoping, hoping for you to fuck up and slip
So we can have a reason for fuckin' up your shit

Cause we never had a muthafuckin' peace treaty
So I know I got to get em with game
And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
Cause it's kill or be killed, never cut slack
And if you cut slack, they bust back, fuck that
I never give a second chance to pull the first gun

Man, what’s up with these niggaz out here
Mad at us cause we on top
I love to see niggaz gettin money
Better get it while the gettin is good
Get it while you can, man
And stop hatin me, fuckin with my shit cuz I got more hustle than you
Get yours, get yours baby
Verse One: Dr. Dre
I’m seeing millions, niggaz dont understand
know what? Im makin moves, puttin cash behind plans
to blow up, will he style like this
everyday I parlay, sip Henne and Tanqueray
stay in the mix like Alezay
V.I.P., my shit parked valet
on the prowl again to get honies familiar with the smile again
some try to assault Dre, its still cavi
Im eatin steak while they struggle to break the slave mentality
I givin livin definition long as my hearts tickin
I fought and made the world listen
Whatever fly Dr. Dre invented
turn on the box and let my son watch these studio clowns on 60 inches
I push a rover, shit platinum before the sessions over
rap master with the Houston heat holder
these playas best to get they shit in check
cuz when I get my hustle on aint no playin with a full deck
Chorus: Ice Cube
Lord please, murda my enemies (Yeah)
Burn em at a thousand degrees
And lord please let me make mo cheese
Cuz I aint quite ready to leave (No)
[repeat 2X]
Verse Two: Scarface
Buck the whole world
meant that, gotta stay strapped
cuz 99.9 a niggaz, carry they gats
Super fist fightin shit might come down to dyin
When the time comes down for the tryin I got nine
reasons why niggaz shouldnt step in my face
with the nonsense, cause I’m always heated and you can taste this
Audi little something out the seams a my trousers
with no hesitation I got a team to come clown ya
I down ya, so let your people know what they face
with the type of individual thatll bomb a sub-station
Kaboom! and everybody dies outside
there aint no escapin the Reaper so dont try
Go ahead, close ya eyes, who the next to step?
Face down, hit, bleedin on the steps a death
Check yo self, you just been invaded by true soldiers
December 31st, 96 (the game is over)
Chorus
(I’ve got all my life to live, plus with all my love to give)
Verse Three: Dr. Dre, Scarface
Smokin weed I never trail, I lead
spendin dough, tripped the cost of a ride like it was pocket money, Gs
but these are the things real playas do
talkin shit is real things that the hatas do
I’m namin you
shit’s thick, its time to run for shelter
I kept the word, things could happen to marks like it was helter skelter
Dear diary, I’m runnin outta pages
Fadin, in and out, takin purple hazes
The dazes, Revelations in the last stages
Red skys institute, the silent horns playin
Im prayin with tears in my eyes
Cuz Im tryin to make it into eternal peace without dyin
But they eyein my bank account with beams on my rover
the killa failed to launch his attack (the game is over)

Tck! I'ma call you back
Chorus
Girl you know... (Awww!)
Girl you know I-iii-iiiih
Girl you know I-iii-iiiih love you (Awww baby!)
I think if Adam would of had another squeeze he might
not have ate those fruits from the leaves of life
Far as Eve, there couldn't have been a more deceiving wife
Seeing the nigga had a weak spot and she was right
I just call it how I see it, she in love with him
And he in love too, but still be fucking all of them
Can you imagine you on lock with one breeze for life?
Waking up in the morning and laying down the night
with the same face looking at you all the time
Realizing now that happiness was hard to find
You wanna go out and try to find that smile and face
Plus she's always mad, and her sex ain't great
And she don't suck dick like she used to do
Force a nigga into trying to find him something new
And on the real, I done seen it when it went like this
But girl there's one thing happening that you can't forget
Chorus
But you can never be my main boo, we can remain cool
But we can't be seen and for this I can blame you
Because you got more miles than a F-350
You been ran through, and I know for a fact you got history
But since we met, I've been hearing your name in certain circles
Pussy got a snap like a turtle
And you can catch a nigga on the late night
Coming out the club, half drunk off Remy and Sprite
And make a man out of him quick cause of how you handle the dick
It's unlike no other, she a bad motherfucker
But I'm too strong to let a hoe undercover
make me look fucked up, because unlike those others
I done met a lot of freaky girls in my lifespan
So you can't get mad because I am not your man
Your under-standing was bad, it was not my plan
for you to fall in love with me, girl it's not like that
Chorus
For me to say that, ""I do,"" would be a lie because I don't
believe no woman is right for me so I won't
Try to talk myself into thinking she is
And if she leaves me for this, that's just one less bitch
And trust me, I tried to be a one woman man
But for every one woman, there's a man, home man
Saying, ""Damn, I done spent six years in this shit
the first two was cool and then the bitch just flipped""
And then that's it, had to make some new plans
'Cause your brand new woman got a brand new man
Now you're hurt all alone, steady hitting her phone
But a bigger dick and longer bank roll, she gone
And if I ever say, ""Maybe,"" and you thought that I might
You consider, just imagine what my wife was like
And if you ain't love my kids like you loved your own
And me unconditionally when I was wrong, I was gone
Chorus

""Hello, I'm  not at home, leave a message (beep)
""Yo, bitch, this is (beep) pick up the phone, bitch
I know you're in there
you fucking with that old fucking ass 'Face now, huh bitch
Where my motherfucking kids at, bitch
Fucking bitch, punk ass bitch!""
[Scarface]
Hey, today must be my lucky day
I turned the corner, hit the block and seen that ass from a mile away
(now where's she staying?)  she must be new in the hood
But I aint trippin' on that shit, cause it's all good
I rolled up on her, and I asked her her name
aint a damn thing changed , aint no shame in my game
she said, "" Used to go Thomas""
I slowed my roll, cause she just might be one of my homies' babies mamas
Now where your man at, she said ""Gone at work""
Gave me the look, I cracked a smile and thinkin', ""Go on and flirt""
My homies women aint no thing to me,
Cause if they caught one of my ho's, they'd do the same to me
And furthermore she was peepin' my ride
convertible, 64, with the ride inside
super clean with the discs and vogues
higher than a fuck spittin' this to hoes:
(CHORUS)
Please excuse my attitude, sorry if I'm being rude
but I've got something to say to you
hoping you wont lose your cool
I wanna sneak you out to play with me,
you can spend the day with me
and we can ride and see the sights
It's going down tonight . . .
[Scarface]
Reminiscing on the bitch that I had back in the day
gave the bitch a call and she hung up  in my face
now thats the pits
she didnt have to put up a front
I stuck that ass back in there
and haven't called her for 3 months
I guess it's in me to be doggin' a chic
can't understand how you niggas just be hogging your bitch
Go on and pass her, unass her, send her to the master
Let her take a ride with the Bradster
it cool, dont front  ..ooooh, no sex
no sweat-not even on my mind-we just met
And furthermore, we can get to those
But for now I'm rolling 'Raris spitting this to hoes:
CHORUS
[Scarface]
Now I'm cruisin' to the crib with this bitch that I scooped
Parked my Ferrari, now I'm back in the coup
I knocked her boots - your baby's mama put me to work
I tagged that ass from the back, and knocked her shit in the dirt
She wanted me badly so I put it inside
she got the (front, back, and side to side)
back and forth with the gangster glide
started off at 6 and didn't finish till 9
Hit the showers like I been out playing ball for the day
Now she's asleep, cause she just had her drawers full of dick
(now thats sick) and plus she got you staying at home
with the kids all alone while she's gettin' her fuck on
So believe me when you downin' the Brad
I'm at the pad with your baby mama clowning that ass
so player hatin' niggas check the bitch you chose
I'll be mobbing in my 'benz spitting this to ho's:

Mikey woke us up when he beeped us
Said he found some dope, not only dope but it was cheapest
Gave me the numbers, I said ""Yo B,
My nigga Mike done found some bricks 11-7 a ki"" (yeah)
It didn't sound legit, but still we chanced it
And if it came through, we hit a big lick
11-7 real clean
Then turn back around and sell them bitches for 17
We gathered up the money, we could score six
Headed out to meet him with 2 uzi's and four clips
Ready for whatever
If we went down, we went down together
We met him in his complex
Niggas were hanging out, ""You ready to roll?"" (Bet)
I knew it was fuckery
Wanted to see the money, said he never trusted me
But I can understand that
I got the money right here, now where's the fucking dope at
Now it's the time for the testing out the dope
To see if it's flour, sheep rock, or some powder soap
He went to his car to go and get it
And never came back, oh shit, I wasn't with it
Got me real mad
Now that's the first example of a good girl gone bad
(Verse Two)
Sticking around would be real dumb
Fuck this shit, I ain't waiting to see the outcome
I hopped in my muthafuckin' shit
Steady peepin' out my rearview, ready to shoot a bitch
I got on the phone and called Chiefey
He got me up with Jay, and I told him where to meet me
These niggas be jacking you in Texas
Met up into ?session? and tossed the money in a Lexus
I'm on my way back to the crib
Bido was ?naughty?, now guess what these niggas did
Tried to run us off the freeway
I slammed on my brakes, grabbed my shit and got ready to spray
And that's about the time B woke up
Popped in his clip, and lit him a smoke up
Doing about 90 trying to catch him
We spotted the bastard, said commence to shooting at him
Somebody was riding in the trunk
The bitch flew open, that was a nigga with a pump
He aimed at the windshield (Duck!)
Blasting the seat and in our face (Aww fuck!)
Jay and Chief must of followed us
Pulled up beside him, and pulled out the ride gun
Put the driver's ass in check
We veered to the left and watch the muthafuckas wreck
We exited the freeway fast
A perfect example of a good girl gone bad
(Verse Three)
Now it's time to do him
Called up Mike to help us find him cause he knew him
My nigga was real pissed
Cause them hoes that had him mixed up in the middle of this fuck shit
We followed Big Mike in his jeep
Snuck up on him and caught his ass in his sleep
His little boy was sleeping with him
I had to wake him up cause it was time to get him
But I ain't give a fuck what he done
I ain't gonna kill him in the presence of his fucking son
So I drug him outside
He started to beg ""Bitch be the fuckin' lying""
Took him to the bayou
Your ass has got to go for that bullshit you tried bro
""But what about my son?"" I got him
He's in real good hands, he'll close his eyes then I shot him
Now his son is calling me dad
I got something more valueable than money, from a good girl gone bad

...""let me spit some game to ya""...
[Verse 1]
You gotta war on drugs
well every other day a nigga dies
you showed yours, now let me show you mine
bring the six o'clock news
and let me walk 'em in my shoes
through what you call the inner city
and what I call the blues
I'm broke here, and I ain't wainting on a call
from a resturaunt to bust tables
when Petie's got a job
making 35 a week and all he do is run the streets
this nigga always caked up
chromed out and draped up
constantly telling me we need to get this paper
I'm getting skinny and it's he who get my weight up
straight up
and plus I'm tired of missing meals
so I paid the man a visit...
[Petie] ""What's the goddamn deal?
It's good to see you dog
I thought you might've choked up
respect and money, well I can get you both of 'em""
[Face] ...I went inside, watching him break it down
when he was finished he handed a nigga nine
a nine milimeter, nine zips
said if I sold each one for nine, I'd have grip
I hesitated, I ain't never sold a stone
I done seen it fuck the hood up
plus all my niggaz gone
and they ain't never coming out
so with that in consideration
I took the package and bounced
I'm headed home, dazing out in a zone
eyes on my luggage, I'm abouts to get it on
get to the house, spread it all on the couch
getting this bank what it's about
[Hook]
That's how a nigga made
they got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave
Get money everyday
it ain't no other way
that's how it is until they put me in a grave
[Verse 2]
I'm in the living room looking at the news
got a razor and some zipper baggies
about to do the fool
cutting hundred dollar slabs
wholesaling niggaz halves
getting money like a muthafucka
serivng niggaz bags
got the blocks all blowed up
the whole hood smoking
got a pistol I ain't shot yet
so dude's wide open for it
I'm just a youngster, I ain't done it, but I will
'cause I was taught you got to get it
so I get it how I live
Finna get my ma a crib, she ain't working
so I'm forced to win the bread for the household
'cause dad was no support
often in and out of court, caught a case out of town
got a body on his conscience, but nobody made a sound
he was going through the motions
he gonna probably beat the case
still I get down on my knees
and beg the Lord to let him raise
get up and get my workers out
supply 'em with the goods
give instructions to the goons
to come up out the hood
I ain't gotta pay the fronters
so I'm finally finna raise
'cause the bottom line is this homie
you gotta get paid
[Hook]
That's how a nigga made
they got a nigga paid
I'm a muthafuckin' jacker not a slave
Get money everyday
it ain't no other way
that's how it is until they put me in a grave
I never learned a trade
I fuck with chess and spades
the only other game a nigga learned to play was
working hopping yay
'cause kissing ass was gay
I'm on my business, I want money like I'm jade
[Verse 3]
I'm the nigga in the hood
these little homies wanna be like
I got when shit was good
but now-a-days off in this street life
these niggaz switch it on you
quick to put you in the crosses
now he standing in your crib
and got a pistol in your mouth
that's your muthafuckin' boy
he popped you and popped your broad
now he headed to the closet
and he about to take it all
so watch your muthafuckin' friends
'cause them the ones that sell you out
ain't no future in being loyal
when niggaz see you want the top
jealous hearted muthafuckas
always quick to say you hating
I don't want another homie dog
he swallowed that and chased it
you can make it like I made it
I think it's best you do it dolo (solo)
that way niggaz can't say shit about you
when talking to the po-po
oh yo, you know that dude that fronted me my come up
I caught him coming out the neighborhood
and had him done up
that's why I'm skeptic
when it comes to different faces
'cause I know I got it coming
but 'til then, I'll get my bank, shit
[more ad libs]
...""fuck you think this is?""...
...""more food for thought""...
...""that's how this shit go

Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxin them roads
When I was huggin it, niggaz couldn't do nuttin wit it
Straight from the oven wit it - came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth, for the shit she instilled in me
Still with me, pain plus work
Shit she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggaz can't fuck with me
I'm callin guts everytime, drag my nuts everytime
Homey, we make a great combination don't we?
Me and the Face Mob, everytime we face-off
Face it y'all, y'all niggaz playin basic ball

Plain clothes wanna run in my room (whooooo...)

Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake dawg
Give niggaz a break, nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang fo', to go against the grain (no)

Don't got no wholesale, cuz that ain't how I wanna run it
Here take these five stones and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta see my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets fool
Money is an issue - and that's on the fa' shizzle my nizzle
Ya block warm, then I come by with the fizzle
And make fa' sho' I get to work mines, for part of the time
We go to war and you ain't makin a dime (ha ha!)

Turn a whole one from a half a brick, look I mastered this
You can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make ya swell up if ya gasket clicked
You can make ya chips swell up, ya don't hafta pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watch the traffic switch
Young'n never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz
And keep ya whole hood on flip - like on box-spring
Pissy Mack and shit, low old box of things
Strictly glassy shit - I hug the block like a quart of water
Shit I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter

Slangin loose quarters, this Philly cat back gatted (had it)

Still bustin with that black-matic

Scarface must be stopped
-After being monitored by secret service agents for two years
-Evidence leads Tobacco and Fire Arms officials to believe that his
literally dope lyrics promote drug usage and distribution
-Degrade women, influence gambling, promote and teach violence and more
importantly
-Its influencing our minors and destroying our young community
-Officials say, he's the lord of underground rap and his music must be
stopped
Scarface:
We got this whole motherfucker on a mission
Now the whole entire world's gotta try to come up with a quick decision
They claim we threats to society
And now they callin on the government to try and make somebody quiet
For the bullshit they done to me
Gangsta Nip, Spice 1 or 2Pac never gave a gun to me
So gangsta rap ain't done shit for that
I've even seen white folks from River Oaks go get the gat
So why you tryin kick some dust up
America's been always known for blaiming us niggas for they fuck-ups
And we were always considered evil
Now they tryin to bust our only code of communicating with our people
Lets peep the game from a different angle
Matt Dillon pulled his pistol every time him and someone tangled
So why you criticize me
For the shit that you see on your tv
That rates worse than PG
Just bring your ass to where they got me
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus:(Repeat 2X)
Nigga don't believe that song
That nigga's wrong
Gangstas don't live that long
So now they tryin seperation
And sendin black folks in white coats to infiltrate our congregation
Tappin into our conversation
Saying the message that they give
Bring forth or premeditation
So David's got a silver mag
While listenin to Brad, David gets mad and kills his dad
David Duke's got a shotgun
So why you get upset cause I got one
A tisket a tasket
A nigga got his ass kicked
Shot in the face by a cop, close casket
An open and sgut situation
Cop gets got, the wanna blame it on my occupation
If you don't dig me, than nigga you can sue me
Because the shit that I be sayin ain't worse than no western money
Don't blame me blame your man Gotti
So you can feel the hand of the dead body
Chorus:
Ice Cube:
You best to free your mine
Before I free my nine
And stop fuckin with the void in pop
Or feel my hot rocks
Bang,bang, boom boom, ping ping I'm the black
White boys gat a magazine and don't kow how to act
I'll attack and make you vomit
Down with Kahlid Abdul Muhammad
Do he got a brother, I'm it now
I'm the illest
Wanna kill this house nigga Don Cornelius
Can you feel this?
You punk niggas make me sick
Suckin on the devil's dick
Scared of revolution
Need to start deuchin
Houston is the place
I caught a case
Them motherfuckers tried to put a scar on my face
But i bust two times to the gut
To the Reverend Calvin Butts
Gotta pair of nuts?
I started this gangsta shit in 86
Now you dissin me
For publicity
Isn't he a hoe to the third degree
Who me
I'm a g who like to scrap-a-lot

I'm on the hunt, so keep your shit low
But yo, I'm kinda slackin up, I shoulda killed you from the get-go

What possessed this muthafucka to tell me fuck me?

I mean it like I scream it, cause, niggas, I done seen it
Muthafuckas with the false nuts
Come with the static and they get they funky ass shot the fuck up
So I give they ass a big blast
Instead of turnin the other cheek, I get dead up in this bitch ass
Cause yo, this shit is real life
I'd rather be piped up in a box than be runnin from a steel knife
So once I put your ass in the red
I'm goin for the head

I blew my horn cause I don't knock
The only thing that's on my mind is fuckin this bitch and puttin her ass out
But yo, this shit is breakin up
She's tellin homie she don't wanna fuck, so homie loc is breakin up
It just so happened homie see my low
And now he's madder than a muthafucka, 'specially when he see me blown
And now he's got some beef, too
But yo, I ain't gon' squab my partner over this freak, du
So I cut the shit quick
And said, ""Yo, we ain't gon' have to come to ???? over this freak bitch
If you want her, you can have her
Because I got what I wanted, she sucked my dick, so, money, you can stab her""
But I said this to myself up
If I told homie I fucked his gal, then homie nut the fuck up
So I kept it on the down-low
And just laid back and watched the fuckin reaction of this clown hoe
But this nigga is a real trick
He's talkin shit and wantin to jump off into some ill shit
So I told him fuck him
And if he came a little closer, then I would have to buck him
He came a little closer, so I gave him one
( *shot*) And left the muthafucka stunned
And right before I mobbed
I gave him one more for the road, just to finish the fuckin job
So off with your head, bitch
Cause I don't fuck around with that 'return from the dead' shit
I'm makin sure I get you good
And if you twitchin like you still alive, homie loc, I wish you would
Cause that just gives me one more reason
To grab the trigger of this muthafuckin pistol and continue squeezin
I don't believe in second ghosts
You only get one chance, and if you slip, then yo ass is smoked
Some niggas say they feelin this
But niggas ain't real with this
Cause niggaroes ain't killin shit
But yo, I guess it's dead
And I be givin you 2 to your muthafuckin head
Makin sure you're dead

Now I'm believeing what Rhonda was saying back in the day
When the homeboys left she the only one stay
And for that very reason I'ma try and give her the world
I found heaven in the form of a girl
Everybody say
My Angel my sunshine bless the day that I found heaven in the form of a girl
My best friend my good time bless the day that I found heaven in the form of a
girl
Listening to different scriptures, they teach on God
and if you ain't never met him, don't speak on God
I'm serious about religon, this just ain't no song
hearing niggas make up scriptures and playing along
probably saying I'm a hypocrite for judging these folks
but you can tell he ain't a christian by the way that he spoke
I pray for everybody hoping that they hear that voice
the one that paralyzies you from head down boy
where you aware of your surroundings yet you still can't move
water shooting out of your eyes when you hear this dude
and the voice is much louder than the voice you thought was the voice of the
holy spirt

America the beautiful don't be so cold
how you expecting our seeds gone grow
when you trap us in the ghetto and show love to the other mothafuckas
while we right here starving at home
I'd cry if I thought me shedding a tear might help
then again me shedding tears don't help
wanna call up to the president just to see if he know help
let him know you up shit creek yourself
we all sinners
facing a winter
wit no socks and no shoes
in a position where we all gone lose
instead a penetentaries we gone need more schools
now what the fuck is we gone do
sit around and let the world pass us by
waiting on the message from the reverend
and he ain't but another man trying to get to Heaven(repeat&fade)

Tear that motherfucker down I just want your draws
That's why I'm laughing everytime you call
'cause I know that you're in love with how I broke it off
The nigga strokes too soft and she a beast in bed
And when she fucks she talks pussy is deep and wet
And I don't need the taxes I don't sweat the bitch
And sworn and damn and that's some texas shit
and I won't fuck's em on the first day, I peeps they mind
So they know that what they havin more important than mine

Make you look like you're a couple when it's not at all
How it is in actualities you close your mouth
We do better gettin' tracin' down important talk
Understands that you got a man is probably not
In the end is something both is something seasons out
And even if we are just friends that don't justify
You being seeing with a boy like him
'cause boy that's bad and they know before it's over
You be bend over my sofa while I bust that ass
And while that nigga takin' pictures of you behind your clothes
Sendin' roses to your office while he's crying and soars
Stuck wonder while you leavin mouth in the cloth
She's floppin' with your business what somebody been told
She was probably a hoe, probably somebody you know
On your cell phone dial while you hittin' that note
Now we squeezin it for...

If she a hoe in the beginning she's a hoe for life
And I can't understand how niggaz make these hoes they wife
You got hoes that's filipino you got hoes that's white
You got hoes from Puerto Rico that's just cold as ice
And it is what it is ain't no changin' the facts
It was a shame when you only thought they came in black
Now how insane is that, had a change of heart
Though you have a worth then it came a pork
Then she hangs with boys you need to tell your broad
Said until she met him she never came this hard
And the shamest part while you at home relax
I make her eyes, I try to brake her motherfuckin back
On the balcony bend over lookin bad as hell
Finger fuckin her and slappin on that ass as well
See then inhales that long excel, and then you hear

Ghetto niggas remain violent while the killers remain silent
Niggas strapped with 45's and ain't smiling
And I'm driving to a place they're all warrin?
The lake we build houses but it's the hood we call home
In the ghetto the only place a motherfucker will keep it real
We focused on the dollar bill, still
The outsiders tend to disrespect the place
Where niggas do thier struggling die with a straight face
Surviving, under conditions demons dinin?
You can run it but can't hide it so step aside
Its the nigga that makes music for the streets
Cause I love this motherfucker like pussy with no sheets,
Cause it's deep
Some niggas make it out the neighborhood and won't surface
And let the money make them nervous, what's the purpose?
A motherfucker sitting on fat
He came up in the hood but he can't come back
Fuck that, I remain in the street game frame
On a mission to maintian me and take aim
In position to let my opposition know my life
Cause off in these streets I keep it real but what's right?
Surviving, sitting on a key doing business on a beeper
I'm sinking in this motherfucker deeper
Fear the reaper that no man born or woman harm me
Fuck being a nigga in your army; though I'm a killer
Enter the ghetto so that you can see
What I mean when I say I love this cause it love me
Let it be, stop looking at this motherfucker strange
And talking ?bout a motherfucking change
This is for my thug niggas

And me and you selling fucking toasted up (? )

Twenty inch wheels candy paint so we drug dealers
No limit soldiers to the fullest
See I was raised on some red beans the size of some bullets, huh
We ghetto niggas can't be stopped
Got me mixing up dope with little j down at rap-a-lot
My phone tapped the feds on my tail
Got me paying luxury taxes on everything I build
True to the ghetto that's my life
You see that house on the lake it's for the kids and the wife
You can test me if you wanna
Cause I be dumping niggas off from new orleans to california
Rowdy like a hurricane (uuuuuugh)
Independant, black owned got them hooked on this cocaine
You used to see c in a suit and tie
But we young niggas in tennis shoes and diamonds
Executive street millionaires
Niggas gonna be bout it bout till we gray in the wheel chair

And now we rocking keep this shit popping
And all my niggas across the bay know l.a. keep the shit hot
I keep my glock inside my pants , don't give niggas a chance
To put me inside a casket you dirty bastards
Until the day I die you catch a nigga high off weed the police can't
Find me
My shit will drop and I'll sell five million
While all the niggas enter the game get caught up in drug dealing
How can I fall? how can I ball, how can I catch my enemies and murder

My word of flame burn niggas inside thier brain
Niggas can't hang with me, and like it changes, uh

We laced it motherfuckers in thier body and face, uh
Growing thicker, liquor made me daddy and nigga
Niggas don't wanna see me world wide mob figure

And to the niggas in my zone we do it long ways

Verse 1:
He greets his father with his hands out
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the man's child
The world is different since he's seen it last
Out of jail in seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's worth
Now she's gone and he's gotta make a change and make it for the beddah
But he's back so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And this goes to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's calling up his homie who dun came up
Livin' like this now they dealin' with the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth it
and with that fucked up attitude he killed his first mate
Now it's different and he's dead as dirt
And realized that the name ain't coming up but it still hurt
And cain't nobody change this
It's ninteen-ninety-foe and we up against the same shit
*chorus* I nevah understand why
I could nevah seen a man cry, til i seen that man die
Verse two:
Imagine life at it's full peak
Then imagine lying dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth when there's no grief
Imagine grief on this earth when there's no peace
Cuz everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for service then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for the final touch
I see the fear in your eyes and hear your final breath
How much longeer will it be til it's all done?
Total darkness and ease be in all one
I watch him die and when he dies let us celebrate
You took his life, but your memory he'll never take
You'll be heade to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your mother's face
*chorus*
Verse 3:
I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you kinda scared of dying so you hold on
And you keep on blacking out cuz the post is near
Stop trying to fight the reaper just relax and let it go
Because there's no way you can fight it but you'll still try
And you can try it til you fight it but you'll still die
Now your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigormortis starts to set, now you outta here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you're still feeling outta place
So you standing in the tunnel of eternal light,
And you see the ones you never learn to love in life
Make the choice let it go but u can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die, may he rest in peace
I still got to wondah why,
I never seen a man cry til I seen a man die
*t.v. in the backgroung*...hope you feel beddah!!!

They lookin' at me strange so I'm lookin' at they ass back
I got a little problem so I'm writin' you a note
A letter to the KKK from the black folks
I'm tryin' to get it on, tryin' to check the grip
and there goes officer cracker tryin' to sink my fucken battleship
Turnin' on his flashers, callin' up the dogs
now my Lexus Coupe is flex surrounded by the hogs
Snatchin' out my seats, tellin' me I sell dope
am I on probation or parole? I tell 'em fuck no!
Tell me mister officer, what's the problem?
what's the matter?
Why you gotta treat us like scum? Is it that a
nigga's doin' a tad bit better than you?
and brutality is all that you crackers can do
and mark me up for resistin' yo ass
when in reality officer friendly kicked my ass, damn!
You overflex your authority too
Put your foot in my shoe, and let me try on your boot
So I can run it in reverse
you can treat me like god, and I can treat you like dirt!
The 22 years I been here I saw
motherfuckers disrespect god before they disrespect the law
but yo I gots ta diss 'em
cuz I refuse to be mislead by this ungodly system
mister president I beatin' on yo back do'
I make yo mind doin' rap but I'm black doe... nigga
""We are United States of America. You honestly believe
just because you wear bags that means you care?
You have the right to abuse and treat my people like
they're animals on the street? I'll be damned you're
bloods will flow with the hands of the black man
in the same streets that you killed me and my brothers in.""
Mister mister officer, mister officer, mister sergeant
Just because I'm young and I'm black I'm a target?
You say I'm sellin' dope but you fake
cuz young dope dealers flash cash and make mistakes
and besides we ain't dealin' no mo'
look at my hood, we ain't killin' no mo' so
everybody's yellin' peace
The only war that's goin' on is goin' on with the police
cuz they ain't stoppin' with the bullshit
If they could they'd lock us up with some chains and swing a bull whip
cuz they figure they're the master
and they can take you to jail or take your lifes
them sorry bastards
That makes me wonder why
the five-o can determine if we live or if a nigga dies
and to me that shit is bull
only god can take life but I still gotta watch the law
It's bad enough I watch the next G
but even worse I gots ta watch the motherfuckers who protect me
They fucken packin gats yo
They serve and protect, they don't respect cuz I'm black hoe
""Every black man that is a car jacker will start jackin'
police cars and watch jaw brains shad on the dashboard.
Why when you pull us over you show us your pistols before
you aks us for our drivers license? Somethin' is not right!""
Rollin through my hood in my motherfuckin' dropper
Gettin' tailgated by a motherfuckin' copper
But I ain't got respect for you motherfuckin' dickheads
cuz y'all was straight hoes back in school nerdy shitheads
I finally figured out why you bitches roll in packs
cuz niggas who ain't shit talk loud and pack gats
You got a fucken pistol, now you think you're a VIP man
but you can get cut becuase you'd be just like the next man
Holdin' me for nothin'
Runnin' my fucken license plates
My plates come clean
You call the DEA
The DEA
says I'm a known drug dealer
straight born killer
a motherfuckin' wig splitter
He don't know shit about a nigga but I'm black
As far as he's concerned all niggas push crack
and plus I'm 22, that really makes 'em check
a drop-top Benz, Lexus Coupe, no respect
I gotta be doin' long I'm hidin' somethin' from the demons
He gotta be stringin' yale, let's play someone that's pregnant
cuz niggas can't have shit but I'm a motherfuckin' troop
You come to us like Luke
Undercover David Duke
Mister David Duke
Mister officer
Mister mister master
I'm pickin' out your coffin sir
Die motherfuckers, I'll send your folks my worst

I woke up to a tune on the radio, check it
An old church hymn behind a breakbeat record (yeahhh)
Sounded kinda funky so I pumped it, right
but rudely interrupted by a neighborhood street fight
When will you motherfuckers quit?
Every motherfuckin mornin it's the same ol bullshit
I peeped to see the thrashin
Some nigga runnin with a butcher knife, screamin out ""Assassin!""
He ran by a friend of mine, it bugged him
His eyes showed fear, that's the reason why he stuck him
Anyway, that's how I seen it
You rarely see a nigga kill another nigga,
and he doesn't mean it
So that's the way I took it
Anyway the boy is dead, no matter how you look at it
And life goes on..
I was feelin kinda funny - aiyyo something's wrong
I went to take a shower Duke
Bumped into the wall and I smooth went through
Now I'm thinkin I'm in trouble
I reached to touch my face, but I couldn't feel my beard stubble
I screamed, ""Oh Lord help!""
Looked into the mirror and I couldn't see myself
I called up my mom's house
and realized somethin was wrong, no doubt
She picked up, said ""Hello"" in a low tone
I said, ""Hey ma!"" and she hung up the telephone
Sick and lookin weary
My cousin walks in, I said, ""What's up?"" but he didn't hear me
Started packin up my shit G
Looked at a picture of me, put it down and said, ""Rest in peace""
Realizin what he said man
I can't talk, I don't exist, I'm a dead man
Yeah I guess I'm dead right?
I'm goin to the cemetary to peep out Action's gravesite
And sure enough, there it is
My mom and girl talkin, holdin on to Brad's kids
I look into the box G
Son of a bitch!  I don't believe it, that's me!
Momma kissed me on my head
Aww shit.. I'm dead (I'm dead)

Hotel, motel, deep up in a hoe's tail
Pussy smellin sweeter than a half a key a dope smell
Knock that top back, told her I'd be right back
Nigga where your wife at, y'all niggas don't like that
I bring a bitch the rough shit, you be on some love shit
Kiss and hold and hug shit, she be wantin thug dick
You winin, and dinin, puttin all ya time in
I be into windin, knockin out the linen
Silk pink panties, but she can't understand me
I be buyin condoms, you be buyin candy
She love you, lust me, gansta shit, it must be
All the while you spoilin that bitch, so thinkin 'fuck me'
Hard for you to see that, 'cause you be on that weak rap
""Ay, can I get some roses please?"", nigga where your 'G' at
A gentleman, fuck that, wearin suits, what's that?
You hit the hoe she lay there, I hit the bitch she fuck back
Makin voices, noises, voices and noises (moaning)
But when she do, I send her home to you
Pussy hole swole up, everytime she roll up

Now I admit, I didn't put my prick up ya gal
She saves her pussy for you, she's just my dick sucking pal
She tells me her problem, I like to listen and learn
And I don't mind because she's always got a Swisher to burn
And a six-pack, I sit back, chill while she drives
With her skirt pulled down and her panties to the side
Wanna smoke, what's up, open up the glove compartment
Grab the Swisher, kiss her, get my lighter and spark it
Don't know how she do it nigga but when she be drivin
She be slobbin and bobbin while she's givin me noggin
And I've been, tryin to tell myself to chill
But I find myself just takin the wheel
[Hook 2x]
[Too $hort]
She followed me to the bathroom, and I ain't have to pee
I'm at the club tryin to do this little nasty freak
I met last week, you know the panties drop quick
She suck dick with two hands and a whole lotta spit
Average niggas get nervous around the bitch
Lick between her legs and run circles 'round her clit
Fall in love, she'll make your mind a wreck
When she lay on her back, and put her legs behind her neck
Sperm drinker, come in her mouth, she keeps suckin it
It's too sensitive, have a nigga sayin
'fuck this shit, bitch, can I have my dick back'
You don't wanna hit that, you don't wanna be inside that kit-cat
She's too nasty, but I like that
Pussy have you right back, fuck where your wife's at
It's hard for you to fight that
Long throat, nut-gobblin bitch with a tight cat
Gettin head in a white 'Lac, bitch

Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigger's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen
I was no singer, knot on my face
But no chose another time and a place
That I would revenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happen last night
Knuckle-game changed quicker than lighting
Hit 'em, slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, its the fastlife
My product give another nigger advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cuz this life, how many you get?
How many niggers do you know get two
Besides a nigger who snitch to skip a life-bid
Be one in your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect thoughtout knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, catch your mental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggers do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It not your enemy you get you
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people
It's always your own people

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
I be wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stab me in my back everytime they can?
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With the loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons, in between us, came between us

I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sitting, wishing my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggers start looking at me different than this
I'm down to play the real nigger shit to get with a bitch
But I'ma tell a motherfucker like this
You going good is what you come up against
Nigger you get what you get
So the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, weel I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggers know I
Don't believe in letting shit slid, nigger gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
The homeboy demeanor, but let the bullshit come between us

Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
I be wondering, can I trust my friends?

I started small time, dope game, pushin on the corner
Twenty cent cook-up, fifty flippers if you want 'em
Full of formaldehyde, my clothes wreakin marijuana
Cops rollin up on us, my neighborhood's like a sauna
Pistol-grippin, insurin won't nobody run up on us
But if they do, fuck 'em, we murderous nickel-dome 'em
I ain't playin no games, I'm on a mission fo' the change
Motherfuck bein a lame, I'm ten toes in the game - deep
I can't slip, this whole world want me sleep
See I hustle like a predator and prey on the weak
And playin for keeps, cause see, it's a thin red line
between a nigga gettin his, and me gettin mine
And plus I'm a nigga with that feelin like it's my time
And anybody standin in the way of that is dyin
I bust nine, how many times I gotta warn you?
I ain't the one, be pushin buttons in the sight of my gun
I'm the real live version of the Corleone family
So I spit this clearly, so you hoes'll understand me..

One wrong move, and I'ma have to leave you for the goons
Catch you slippin asleep in your bedroom and then {*BLAM*}
Get you Audi, now what the fuck was this dude thinkin?
You can cheat the rules of the streets, and not leave stinkin?

I can squeeze without blinkin, I'm a cold-blooded nigga
Bank robber (ooooh) I'm a natural born killer
Drug dealer, anything it took to survive
Even if it took a nigga to die, I'm a gangsta
[Scarface]
I got a brick from a sucker that he wanted to move
But the whole while I'm cookin I'm like, ""Fuck this dude""
It's on, thirty-six zones of my own
Keep the money fo' myself and take the work back home
Call that nigga on the phone (ay) I just got knocked
And the cops was askin bout you, come get me hot
Never showed, so fuck him and the money that I owed
I got a get rich quick scheme, steppin on the dough
It's cold, but that's it, I'm on it like I want it
And twenty-eight cash and change, the whole game on it
That means I'm on my feet and I can front the homies D
Break 'em off a couple of C, and double up they fee
Takin over, shoot up they spot, make it hot
And when the cops dry it out, put my work on the block
And if they wanna ride for they corners we ride right with 'em
Dummy move, whole thing, the goon squad get 'em
[Chorus]
[Scarface]
No mo' petty rock hustlin, I'm in for the run
And I'm fo'sho I'm gon' be murdered for this shit that I done
But I'ma die standin up cause I'm a stand up nigga
Fuck dyin like a bitch on my knees, I'm a killer
So don't nobody cry cause I was destined to get it
Just remember, I'm the one who took the dope game and flipped it
and pimped it, and destroyed everything in the way
of me seein first motherfuckin light of the day
A trigger man, deadly as fuck with a loaded AK
Spot my enemy and kill him the American way
I turned a dream into reality, with a fuck you mentality
Silencin all these niggaz in the neighborhood who challenged me
Family grievin from they loved one's mortality
He ain't got a reason to die then kill hi, it's a tragedy

And till I die I gon remain with these Niggas
St. Paul in
The M-P-L-S, I hear you callin'
I put it down yes
Now Chris Rock were you at
I heard you say some shit about some blacks
Nigga, this been your ass back
Come see the real deal
Stay in the fields Nigga
These Niggas will kill
This ain't no cap-gun shots, Nigga
This a Glock, pah, pah,
It's death on your block
Knock, knock
Whut's up Nigga?
These sirenes start singing
It's me and Yuk with the L-G in the makin'
It's stinkin', freakin'

Creepin, seekin'

Fuckin wit us, fuckin wit us!
Verse 2:
[Yukmouth]
It's in my veins
Like a chain-reaction
How it all happened
Paps is slangin' crack in the mid 80's
Back in the day when shit was crackin'
Niggas pay 38 for a package
Tightly rappin'
For shippin' and handelin' taxes was added
That's where the A-raps headin'
Even when I sleep they in cavage
Lavage shit
Do automatics with scopes under my mattress
With the dope and the drugmoney,
stuffin' that shit up under the rugmoney
Thug hungry
Takin' drugs only cause we love money
I'm a Nigga, he's a Nigga,
would you like to be a Nigga too
Makin' big scrilla like these Niggas do
You probably be a drugdealer too
Scan and tuned in to the boys in blue
Listen for clues
In the kitchen bakin up Peruvian flake
It takes
28 grams
Multiplied by 36 zips to make
A triple beam brake, a triple beam shake
A hundred grams on the triple beam flake
2.2 pounds to be straight
My Niggas just flew in from GA
Ready to buy 4 kilos
Then drive slow back to Youngstown Ohio
So fuck these rhymes
Let me stick my dick in your ear,
and fuck with your mind
Nigga
Chorus
Verse 3:
[Big Mike]
Niggas betray themselves as low key,
broken down and fabricated
Easily ejaculated, table with and half way faded
Ain't no wars cause they made it
That type of bullshit is outdated
But I played it like I laid it
My partners have always said that
It was set me up
For life
Money, clothes and hoes but road I chose was
Nothin' nice
Niggas know just what it's like to be hustelers
Governors from strugglers
Bitches lovin' us
Blindly chasin' that life we lust
I blush,
bottles, havin' thoughts and iring dreams
Goin' down and roll fast
Tryin' to get what my eyes have seen
Fried of me, huh
Nigga for a hand that got me through these eyes right to see
But part not I was blind to the point,
not even I could see, or that I could be
Obviously
I wasn't meant for me this type of trickery
Hit me with the type of mystery
Lay it down like history
With the intend of be myself and I
Street desire, easila
Piece of mind, I was least to find
Some sassiness
Hossisiless it gets to shit and praise to the farmer innercist
Nobody was meant for it, it was deadly
And I was discontent
With the shit that life once sent
Government depend, now most of my time is spent
Escapin' what I love
It's in my blood

It was a cold morning, gloomy, sun barely shining
Figured it was gon rain today, so i'm in
Sit around the house until the thunder storms slacks off
Look at my nightstand, and pick the paper back up
Nostradamus, I'm readin chapter, after chapter
Predictions of the end of world, and after
Life, wit no beginning, as the world stops spinning
?as a journey that's never ending
I glance at my baby boy, I can see this in his eyes
The little nigga glad to be alive
And as the days go by, I thank god for watchin mines
Prayin that I remained in fire
The same man that I was, which starts from the other mind phrase
Was it the cash I think my time came
For me to venture off into different demensions
The beginning, the endind, of my time
[Chorus: 1x]
What we fail to realize
Is that we runnin outta time
Do we ever be born again
In my time of dying
It's like i'm runnin outta time
Will I ever be born again
[Verse 2]
In my time, I try to stay true steps on the game
And if you nigga's thinkin like me, do the same
Which is one minute ya smilin, the next ya start cryin
Cause we can't accept we born to die
And I, ease my edge, and be a nigga to the end
But it's more to life then me and my benz
When my mama told to speak to my friends
I kinda took that shit to heart
So don't fuck up your life, 'fore it starts
Some nigga's wanna be like Mike
I'd rather be like Christ(like christ)
So at the end, i'll see bright lights(bright lights)
I save a prayer for the fallen soldier's
Too many nigga's died young, for tryna to hang
On the slaim's of our slums
And outcome, as mommy neals, sittin on the front row
Hopin god will accept your soul
The new millienium, and as I sit watch the distance
Ships walk the horizon, I'll stare into space while i'm drivin
And pray for me, all the ends of my sins
The beginning, the end, of my time, till i'm born again
[Chorus: 1x]
[Verse 3]
In my time, I've seen life born, and I been blessed
Enough to see life lossed, it's just the price life cost
And shortly, explain my born, I know i'm born to do it wrong
So when i'm gone, life goes on
Tell my mother, when she on the front row, hold her head up
Shed no tears, and dred those years
Smile, and even though my whole life's been a po'ball
You did your's, and it's not your fault
Tell my grandmother those words too
She knows i'm headed to a better place
That'll put a smile on my wife's face
God's graced the evil spirit that surronded me
And pass me, and anytime it could'a had me
But when it all went wrong, sung the same ol' song
Now it's peace after the storm blew on
And??, it's the better life, security for your's and mines
What the evil lies, and not so guide
In my time, it's been times, I would've stopped and called the quits
But I might as well sit until it's over wit
Eath to earth, and ashes to ashes, dust to dust
It's the lord I trust
The territory where I come from, so I guess it'll be when I return
No sorrow, it was just my turn
And in those, last trumphet sounds, put me down in the ground
But i'll proably be at home by now
And it's help will change(these helps will be changed)
Blinking of a eye, but I don't think I'll get to see that
In my time, till i'm born again
[Scarface talking]
It's changed, when we born
And how we born from woman
We born, from the spirit, of life
And all our flesh remains
And not, by the flesh of man
And not by the flesh of man
Do not believe that
[Chorus until fade]

And I'ma make you hoes remember my name

So hush with the talk, talk
Claimin you gon' put it on the map

It's been thirteen years and aint went nowhere
Still, one of the coldest ever done this shit
And aint no motherfucking question know who run this bitch
I got my nigga Erick Sermon he supplied the beat
And I be in the vocal booth, supply the heat
Up in the game, for the street, these blocks and thugs
With a pistol grip shotgun to box someone
And it's a thin red line between what was and aint
Got a $50 sack, plus I love to drink
I be in southside nigga til it's said and done
And I was always taught to take the bread and run
Here it is, the motherfucking moment of truth
I came in one deep now what you hoes wanna do

Man how the fuck am I gon' keep me paid?
Believe me mayne; if I got to die I got to go
This was all never sure cause danger life I know
It was all about the diamond chains, or the ride and bank
Smoke and listen to the Isleys sang
Would I ride the same? Dawg, probably not
Laid back reminiscin on the times I shot
Dare all motherfuckers trippin in them parkin lots
If it was war niggaz wanted it was war they got
I'm a nigga, a real nigga, a quick thanker
that would hesitate to aim and see the chamber
Discharge the cartridges that the hollow-point came from
You can hide but you cain't run
Yeah, and he just started what can not be stopped
And fucked up cause you were thinkin you could not be got
Chorus
This is not a game
Niggaz want a lifestyle with finer thangs
Hustlin to come up on these diamond chains, diamond rangs
Runnin on the daily out here tryin to slang
Now analyzin all the wrong I've done
I'm surprised I ain't dead I guess the good die young
I put a hole in a nigga head, fuck why run
from a lazy motherfucker cause he flashed his gun
We ain't cut from the same shit, nigga I'm a shooter
If I show I got a pistol best believe I'ma shoot a
stupid motherfucker down, shoot a motherfucker down
Chalk his ass in the dirt with a bullet in his mouth
And I won't lose sleep cause when it come time for me to pay the piper
Fuck it, I've been tryin to meet
Yeah~! So please believe that when it's time to show
I'll be ready with my arms crossed, dyin to go
And I won't shed tears, I'm respected here
And you won't hear things you'd expect to hear
I rejected fear; and I don't wanna be another second here
But the question is, is he lettin me live?
Chorus
Right here the pros and cons
Cause life's way deeper than the frozen arm
They might streetsweep you if you're holdin on
My Sunday School teacher taught us Job in songs, another soul is gone
She couldn't have told me shit
Cause all I wanna do right here is fold me grip
And she talks to me in codes and all I know is bricks
Learn how to rock me up an O I coulda sold for six, instead she sold me tricks
So now I plead my case
The cops all on me tryin to bleed my safe
My pops all on me tryin to squeeze my face
But I'm not gon' squeal so I'ma need my space, back up I need my space
Momma ain't raised no rat
The word got back and niggaz paid for that
Yo' ass got served and never made it back
Your ass had birds a nigga laid you flat, and then he raid your stack
That's how the game is played

Too my pistol out, unlocked it
Pulled the hammer back and - cocked it
And left his shit all on the carpet
I seen a (murder, murder) I pin-pointed my target
I'm making my way up out the building
I got the nigga that I came here to get, notify his children
That they old man done fell up out the game
Because I came to this muthafucka
and killed his ass just like Jesse James
Think it's a muthafuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and kill yo ass just like Jesse James
What's my muthafuckin name?
There'll be no witnesses to this homicide
No re-enactment on the late night news to be re-dramatized
All you got is a nigga with a dot
In the middle of his muthafuckin head he been shot
Dropped in the middle of the floor and he ain't breathin
And the nigga's on the go cause we ain't seein
He did his dirt and got the fuck up out the picture
The hollow point just hitcha, out of line, so it got witcha
Call the muthafuckin helicopter
But ain't no hope, cause the Tina broke that nigga off a hella proper
That oughta hold your monkey ass (muthafucka, you)
That oughta teach your funky ass (muthafucka, you)
I know this muthafuckin game is sheift
And you done lost the fuckin game of life
And that's a muthafuckin shame
You let a nigga come around and do yo ass just like Jesse James
And that's a muthafuckin shame
You came around this muthafucka and let me do ya like Jesse James
Think it's a muthafuckin game?
Wait - this muthafucka got me bent, I gots to - break
Because this nigga done put his hands all up in my - face
He best to chill before I hit him with this - lace
And catch this muthafuckin case
Cause once I got it blind, then he done with
Because I'm true to myself, fuck the dumb shit
You ain't no muthafuckin gangsta, gee
And when I get up out your ass you gon' realize it just ain'tsta be
It ain't no studio up in me
And all that bullshit I'm hearin you talk only offends me
And lately I'm under a lot of pressure
It seems to me you can't come clean, so yo, I gots to check ya
I pull my .45 and (buck, buck, buck, buck)
And right before he die I (fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck)
I could give a muthafuck about the sentence
I snatch yo ass up off the hinges cause I'm (SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE)
Cause life has no meaning, no meaning
We were all born to die, so no screaming
Think it's a muthafuckin game?
I come around this muthafucka and cut yo ass just like Jesse James
Put out your muthafuckin brains
I come around this muthafucka and do yo ass just like Jesse James

TOUCH THAT
Verse 1
We made something from nothing
And vowed to never tear it apart
We turned the street hustle into an art
That would quickly change life forever for us
No more riding bikes or catching the bus
We on the roll up, money to fold up
With cognac and cooked yola
Got the neighborhood about to blow up, but hold up
I see this van sittin', this old cat in a fitted
Trying to get your little homey tore up
Yo bruh, we ain't working on this corner take your ass on, dog
Fore you make me feed your ass to my hogs you fucking faggot
I know you want to catch me with this bag so you can hide me
Or with my 44 so you can 45 me
You put this shit off in our neighborhoods and sweat us
And when you finally catch us up you give us letters
A cold thing
Just when a nigga reach his gold man
You hand him a case for easing out the dope game
And I'm...
CHORUS
Watching us unfold with the times
He don't really want a nigga to climb
You'd rather separate me from my family forever
Instead of trying to keep us together
You motherfuckers would rather keep me down....
Verse 2
So what I rap about these streets
That don't make me be no less of a man
Than a person that do work with his hands
It's bad enough I gots to deal with all these pressures that stand You tryin'
to make me stray away from my plan
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm from the gutter, where all we had was one another
No wheat bread to butter, from one bed to the other
All uncles and no brother
My mother's at work
My grandfather was my dad
And when he died it hurt
And as I hold back the tears my eye-wells swell
I been praying for heaven, I been living in hell
And these niggas in my age group is dead or either locked up
The bitches no better, they smoked out or knocked up
But I still love my hood, that's where it started
Ain't no hard feelings, we partners nigga, regardless
That's why you always see me coming around
Cause I could never turn my back on my town
But still I'm....
CHORUS (2x)
Verse 3
Money never changed me
Money changed the people around
Now they plot to try to keep me down
But still I rise like yeast
Your whole conversation bout B
Fuck a nigga talking bout me, I'm a G
The realest motherfucker ever done it
You can't continue to pimp me and y'all eat from it
So fuck every soul who ever felt like I owed
Them a god damn dime, or a god damn rhyme or a god damn chance
Motherfucker you sad
You a grown ass man, holding a nigga hand
Now get out on your own, stop depending on your homes
To chuck you a bone, and stop throwing stones
And that goes for everybody thinking it's them
Fuck you, you and you,
Her, him and him
Tom, Dick and Kim
All of y'all stand accused
Saying fuck to me
And I done bought your children's shoes
I'm...

[K.B.]
As I proceed to give your ass what ya need
A straight guerilla, that hit these niggas for the scrilla
The wig spliter, I cock this 44 revolver, the problem solver
Step and get wet, like saliva
Like Pearl Harbor, I bomb muthafuckas
Got a whole army, so bring it on muthafuckas
You gets no ends, fuckin with interface, nigga
Your facin death, cause it's a whole clique of killas
And cap peelas, niggas that don't give a fuck about they damn self
You'll get your ass heated up, beat a nigga blue
And now we wanna get his crew, I take his whole crew
And I go through em like the flu
I finish niggas
Got more Clan than Menace niggas
I pull triggas, bring the pain to bitch niggas
And terrorize, and I could see it in they eyes
I capitalize, when it's down to Krunch Time, it's Krunch Time
[Verse 2]
[K.B.]
Hoe's phase em all
Cause I'm Mac like Mall
But fuck a brawl, I beat a bitch to my hall
Country is hell, straight from the land of ATL
Got a gang of dope, except I sell it from the shelf
A million sells, and now these muthafuckas jealous
Schemein and plottin, and then they asses smell rotten
Lost and forgotten, they shoulda known there ain't no stoppin
Niggas be floppin, releasin shit when I be droppin
Some try to copy, bullshit be sounding sloppy
But they can't get me, them niggas suck like a hickey
The rhyme sender, drop your shit and surrender
You're no contender, make niggas Fall like November
In the fuckin rumble, you'll see the biggest nigga crumble
Tryin to tumble, I make the widest nigga humble
Big as Mutumbo, stepped away for 44
Your ass is dying, goddamit, in Krunch Time, it's Krunch Time
[Verse 3]
[K.B.]
I hope now you see, that can't nobody fuck with me
In this industry and in the F-a-c-e
The fuckin label, with straight guerillas in the stable
Hit ya like Cable, ain't no muthafuckas able to stop my crew
Interface run shit, and if you niggas can't recognize
your ass die quick
Bitch, you're askin to catch a casket
I'm so drastic, pullin the trigger back like elastic
And blasted your whole area, hoe I bury ya
For layin your mouth ahead of ya
I'm the predator, and you the prey
Nigga watch what you say, I keep this AK
So muthafucka make my day
There's no escapin from this full blooded ape and
You made a mistake-in, and now the beast has awakened
Time to take your life, nigga
You shoulda thought twice
Now your ass is mine, muthafucka, in Krunch Time, it's Krunch Time

It's jumpin off in H-Town, baby
He-he-he
Strictly for the funk lovers, give it to me
And we really want the whole world to see
How it goes..
We want your mind to blow, baby
..when you free your mind and let it float
Let me roooooooooooooll..
We want your mind to blooooow
Just let us hang with you
[ VERSE 1 ]
Hangin in the hood, just shootin the breeze
My partners on the cut smokin swisher sweets
Trippin on the hoochies rollin by in they rides
Guzzlin up a forty ounce of cold St. Ides
Jammin to a tape to my partner had made
'Growin' up in the Hood' bein mixed with Face
Swisher sweet's a killer, feelin nothin but nice
Reached in my pocket for the old school dice
Pulled out a knot and dropped the dice on the flo'
And asked my partner Mike what they hittin fo'
Pulled out a yard and said, ""We bettin a dove""
Tee Lee Baby, show your partner some love
Kickin back fadin, put the flame to the joint
3-2, drop baby, 3-2's your point
Back in the do' with a fo' and a ace
Picked up his ends and waved the dice in my face
And then he hollered out ""School house!""
Schooled em again, now d's come in ounce
And walked away from the crap game broke
But it ain't no thing, yo - just let a brother smoke
Let me roooooooooooooll..
We want your mind to blooooow
Just got some things to do

Back on the creep after losin some change
Seen my partner [Name], Big Chief and James
Creepin on the boulevard, actin a fool
Trippin on the broads at the old school
Music bumpin hard, never turnin it down
Trunk super tight with surround-by sound
Paint job crackin cause the punch ain't fade
Jammin that brand new 2Low tape
Windows all smokey, blowin coke-laced seed
I'm throwin up the deuce to the HPD
Now they lookin crazy like I sold the hay
Just another day in the heart of S.A.
Roll a little further there, I seen O.G.
With his brother named [Name], S.A. O.G.
They chopped up the hood, so I'm chunkin it back
And then they pulled out a $200 sack
When I saw it I almost choked
Twist your partner one, big baby, just let your partner smoke
Let me roooooooooooooll..
We want your mind to blooooow
We got some things to do
[ VERSE 3 ]
Smokin on some lovely, now I'm feelin fine
It's jumpin off at the 9.9
5th Ward in the house with the S.A. fools
Ain't no set trippin cause we all so cool
Drinkin up the bottle, gettin drunk as a skunk
That 151 just ain't no punk
Hit the stage and grabbed the mic and started flexin styles
A stage full of tight MC's goin buckwild
Now throw your hands in the air like that
On the wheels of steel is my homie Lonnie Mack
Gettin down on his own
Now I'm finna pass my partner Jay the microphone
[ Lil' Jay ]
Throw your hands in the air like that
Northside where you at, where you at, where you at?
Throw your hands in the air like that
Southside where you at, where you at, where you at?
Throw your hands in the air like that
Eastside where you at, where you at, where you at?
Throw your hands in the air like that

S.A. and 5th Ward forever, fool
[ VERSE 1 ]
Niggas watch your back cause here I come again
Rappin funky shit for the 199-trey
In 1989 I sold dope for a pasttime
1991 they called that nigga Scarface
Started on the team when a nigga turned 16
Stackin that green sellin dope to the dopefiends
Daddy seen a scheme, thou so it seem
Cause he hooked a nigga up with a nickel-plated triple beam
Had a lotta game with the beam, that's what it came with
Taught a nigga how to get to funk when it jump
If static jumped off, then I was down for the dirt
When puttin in work I ain't no muthafuckin punk
Down with my partners that a nigga fucked around with
Huntin for some shit to get up into and we found it
If you had a problem with a nigga we was down with
We rolled by your set and shot your whole click down, bitch
Niggas play for keeps in the city that I come from
Niggas talk shit from out of town, but they don't want none
If you think you want some, then go ahead and come
It ain't where you at, you stupid bitch, it's where you from
And comin through my hood is where you findin all the thugs at
Lookin for some dope and they gon' show you where the drugs at
Lookin for some trouble, well, a nigga's gonna plug that
Niggas keep they pistols up underneath they rug mat
Show your little ass, go ahead and let your ass show
Talkin that shit, punk bitch, you better dash, hoe
Once I get it on it ain't no muthafuckin holdin this
Kinda fucked up that I'm a nigga that be chauvinist
Niggaroe, the heater want this fool to let the trigger go
But bitch, I gots to give you one to let you niggas know
I'm lettin you bitches know
Front, back and side to side
I'm lettin you bitches know
[ VERSE 2 ]
How a nigga back in the game I used to start shit
Moppin up the hood, makin muthafuckas squab
You fucked with one nigga out of the muthafuckin click
You had to fuck around with the whole fuckin mob
Cause niggas rolled thick and they didn't take shit
Quick to put that ass up in a muthafuckin lynch
Whip it on your ass, then tie it up to a fence
And since we began it's been that way ever since
My niggas used to kick it up around the fuckin pikes
Smokin swisher sweets, drinkin Miller Lites
Takin turns heatin up the muthafuckin mic
And maybe beat a buster out his muthafuckin bike
Crackerjacks kept a muthafucka on the hustle
Makin sure my business stayed stead' trump tight
Hoes sell flippers, gave two for ten
And even gave up shake to keep my clientele tight
Before long I had customers out the ass buyin flippers
Bearskin coats, tight ropes and fat slippers
Fresh fade daily, I had my own fuckin clipppers
And all kinds of hoes on my cocksuckin zipper
Hoes came in handy, but my money came first
Causebitches get aghost when they see a nigga's hearse
So if I ain't have shit I had a muthafuckin ???
And could pull on my dick if worse came to worst
So if you got a problem with the way I run my business
Let a nigga know, so I can put you in your place
9 times out of 10 you ain't man enough to deal with
The born killin, dope dealin Mr. Scarface
Rougher than a muthafucka, takin no shit from a
Busta muthafucka who be flexin off the bullshit
Got my bull pump on all you bitch-made niggas
So let a nigga know when you bitches wanna flip
I'm lettin you niggas know
Front, back and side to side
[ VERSE 3 ]
I had to let you know I ain't that nigga you should toy with
So don't come in my face with that muthafuckin boy shit
Never comin soft with that 'love, peace and joy' shit
Mr., Mr. Scarface, the real deal McCoy shit
Sendin out a shot to all you busta-ass one times
Suck a nigga dick, or make a nigga rich
Cause you don't get props for what you doin for the cops
Except a swift kick and a mouth full of dick
Lettin muthafuckas talk ass about your gameplan
Just because you got a big gat you'se the same man
That used to get your ass kicked daily back in the neighborhood
Finally got a nigga back pushed like you said you would
Fuck it, I'm a nigga gettin down for his cash flow
Down to down a hoe, I'm lettin you niggas know
I'm lettin you bitches know
Front, back and side to side
I'm lettin you niggas know
You know I'm sayin?

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you think I'm cra-zy??? (AAAAAGHHH!! Just bein me)
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me
(I can feel it in my head) I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed
Look me in my eyes (Look me in my eyes)
and tell me what you see (and tell me what you see)
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line?
Is it just my test, or is it just my time?
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me
But I don't sell no dope, so fuck what niggas say
Fuck Ronnie Carbone(?), and fuck the D.E.A.
And fuck these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die
(Until the day that I die)
So fuck you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggaz: ""The F.B.I. been watchin' you""
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule
I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
but not enough to run a dope house, so why you fuck with me?
[Chorus]
Look me in my eyes!
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?(My eyes!)
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee?
[Scarface]
Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged?
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
that leads me to the same place I started from;
right before I left home
(Look me in my eyes!) I thought you was a shrink
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think
OK your time is up, now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes
(Look me in my eyes, my eyes)
You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes

To get up out the ghetto like you
But you straight fried him
See, now what you niggas need is open eyes
Although you made yourself a couple a million, you keep an open mind
Cause down the stretch, you lose your grips on reality
And he who grips, slip on life fades fatality
I seen the same shit you seen in the 70's
And you can blame shit on me, but nigga never
Beat the flow of a youngster, raised up amongsta
Niggas who ain't bullshit with life, they straight stuck ya
Now how the fuck am I supposed to change
A place that since my mother been born it ain't been known to change
And all my niggas can relate to what I bring to 'em
Instead of turnin my back, I sing to 'em
[Chorus:] X 4
Jockin my homies?
Ride for my homies, think?
Cause I'll die for my homies
[Verse 2]
[Scarface]
Dedicated to my homies who been trapped in the jail
Since these other motherfuckers seem to lost they respect
For the place, niggas got game on how to handle these streets
Instead of layin dead, you get knocked down you stand on your feet
If I ain't learn nothing else, I learned to struggle and strive
Cause the ghetto made a man out a nigga, I can't lie
But every black community done seen the same thing
Somebody come up out the hood and make a strange change
Ain't no forgettin where it started for me
The hustle out the hood never departed from me
No matter how many niggas try to change my story
Can't nobody make me go change my story
So motherfuckers claimin that they represent life
Make sure them hoes is representin it right
Talk to me
[Chorus:] X 4
Now break it down to the beat one time
(vocal breakdown)
Talk to me now
[Verse 3]
[Scarface]
How dare you so called black politicians
Knock me for the game that I explain to my listeners
See, they wanna put me on remote control
So they can turn me on and off when they feel it
and try to take control
But I refuse to cooperate
You take away the plug out the game it ain't gon operate
So now we're picky with the wickedly ways
And I done been inside the beast in his belly for six days
Cause they solutions is institutionalize
All the game made millionaires would choose to survive
Instead of fallin dead, we bounce to these beats
But you look at my music like an ounce on these streets
I send this out to every street in your city with blacks on em
Since every motherfucker got paid to turn they backs on em
I got more love for the ghetto than that
And every time I step my ass out the hood, I go back
So you can miss me with that bullshit you stressin
I keep it real with my niggas with no question
So while you're teachin em that shit they can fake to
I teach em shit that they can relate to
My homies
[Chorus:] X 4

Is this how you made it, or is this sickness out of control
Is the beginning of the end right now? Let me know
Do the saved souls travel the road of the souls lost?
How come the dead can't talk?
Through horrified eyes I can picture the other side
And though my heart shed tears outside I couldn't cry
Watched my homeboy die, day by day body tired
Remember, I finally accounted before he expired
They tell me there's a peaceful place, I wanna see it
They say I gotta leave it to see it, so it be it
And though I appreciate bein alive
Sometimes I wanna see how it feels to just die
Come back and tell my story to the ones who really know me
Converse with the angels and elders that went before me
And satisfy the hunger for those who wanna know
If there's life after death, and if so, where we go
I often find myself involved in deep thought
I wanna see is heavens a place like we thought
And Christian science seems to think it's just a mindstate
But before I put my trust in a man I'll just wait
Or better yet, I take the journey for myself
Put a bullet in my own head, it's my death
So when twelve o'clock jump on eve of 11/9
( *gunshot* ) suicide
Just as I thought, a bright light
Greeted by friends and family, so life-like
Black and in between screams and then peace
Lookin in the eyes of the grieved and deceased
Father pleace, send me back, I don't wanna die
I'm not as strong as I was and I can't lie
And during all the mayhem somehow I remained calm
And I woke up singing this song
[ CHORUS ]
I been a pawn and I been a king
And I been down since the beckoning
I try to look beyond the sight of sound
And the lights come from the underground
Rarely got questions but I found myself somewhat astound
And through my quest for the answers, know what I found?
I found that regardless to what people say
The shooters gotta do it day for day
So make your peace
[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
Open your books to the first chapter, verse four, page eight
And link to my thoughts as my intents are to initiate
And enter the minds of the ones who are blind
And shed light to all the mankind written in rhyme
I preach to each to get off your ass, stand on your feet
Cause everyday it's niggas lyin dead in the street
We stuck in our ways, it's different now than back in the days
Fuck what they say, cause ain't no comin back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talkin about
I had a dream and seen a double sun, a different world was in the makin
The ruler of this new world was Satan
The sky turned blood-red, the silent trumpet started playin
Then I woke up, my imagination
Runnin wild but then again the coming of Christ
Could be the moment of any minute, now or tonight
So make your peace, cause 666 is the mark of the beast
It's dark in these streets
And some might see it hard to believe but God is in me
And yea, though I walk through the valley of the wickedness
I know I'm protected cause I'm convicted
Anybody believin in the Big Bang Theory
And thinkin that thyself is the God, you need to hear me
How do you explain
The skies, the moon, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea
The Earth without form facing the deep
Darkness and challengin the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seeds
Didn't make up the trees, so why we turn our backs on the truth?
This heaven and hell part we seem to hide from the youth
I'm tellin what few tongues of the evil will despise
My intention's to revitalize, still I revive
And I've read the Books, and I heard the lessons
And I'm on my knees steady stressin
You make your peace
[ CHORUS ]

I greet the Father on my knees, with a bowed head and humbled heart
My conversation is have mercy on me please
I just wanna be happy will it come to pass
Fresh out of my mind, been 27 years and every day I've seen is sad
Even though I've tried 'til I've cried I can't even stand
Feels like I've died a thousand times but just can't make it man
Ain't nuttin different about me doin dirt
Except I've never crept up on a come up maybe that's why the hustlin hurts
I remember just like it was yesterday I'm 16
Can't find no love can't find no peace I wonder what it means
Could it be because I didn't choose the devil all the time
I became an outcast to the hood, restricted to my rhyme
Where I could not just live my life without my talent makin danger
Jealousy is now state jail from friends that turned to strangers
They hate me, I don't understand why
I swear I never seen a man cry, 'til it was my own eye
I'm 21 and think I finally got a grip on life
And how bills pay the apartment, a step-son and a step-wife
But without a vehicle it's kinda hard to get around
If I got weed I ride for free if not my partners let me down
So now I'm livin to be one deep so much I'm hatin people
Lookin at everybody, even babies like they Satan people
Nobody understand me, everybody's trippin with me
Wonder why when I gotta ride when none of my people flippin with me
Too many haters tryin to take a player off his game
Not tryin to be ballerific, I'm just tryin to have some thangs
They're just like crabs in a bucket, these people pull me down
If I didn't have so many obstacles think where I could be now
On MTV or BET or in some magazine
Instead I'm stressin, hooked on codeine, headed to tragedy
Sometimes I think it's better just to die
Because I never seen a man cry, 'til it was my own eye
(What's happenin now)
In the year two thousand (six) ain't nothin changed for Ro
12 albums strong, lookin for dough and yet I'm still po'
Now I done had and I done lost and I done had again
On the verge of suicide, I deeply wish I had a friend
But even still a good samaritan is Z-Ro's way
And with that Christian attitude I caught a homeboy case
I done took too many blows, a punchin bag is how I feel
The deep depression starts to set, sanity's outta here
I start my mission tryin to find my fate
CDC #4 in name I'm feelin oh-so-helpless in this place
I want revenge it's heavy on my mind but ain't central
Say don't fight evil with evil, try to relax and do yo' time
I heard a voice say there wasn't no need in actin up
Realized I wasn't at peace with God and had to patch it up
Hopin that blessings fall out of the sky
Z-Ro ain't never seen a man cry until it was his own eye

And every now and then I can't help but to think about ya
Hatin' that we ended like this, but I had ya beefin'
I knew what that was missin wondering, and I need ya

Had me thinkin'
She was the only I'd ever needed
Stick in ground, runnin' round, like oh..never need her
I remember seeing cancer sticks, and smellin' inscents
The intimate, and couch, hoping it's soak sex
And niggas so thick, I had to call her up the same night
Dang, they said the number still is the same
Wouldn't let my friends kill her
Take ya penetentiary chances to be with her, go deep with her
Cheif with her, sprung on the number lawn braud
Once she get you hot in her clutches, you can't run
In the dark, hearing footsteps, and you can't sleep
You find yourself so in love with this bitch, that you can't eat
Paranoia, that's a feeling so scarce(so scarce)
This bitch almost made me need Mary

-I'm the first one to tell you I need Mary
-Shit, I need Mary

Mary, been home sick, I gotta see her
And when I finally hit you this time, I'd never leave ya
Took ya love for granite, I was blind
And I'm hoping you can accept my apology, for this one last time
You can tell that I ain't had her, cuz I can't control her
This hasheesh, Mary I love, just like I told ya
I'm sensitive as I write you this letter, so listen to it
Seeing if you'd be down for a threesome

I don't really remember feeling like this

And indeed took the form of life–it's a shame
How a man can fall in love with dreams--not afraid
Not afraid to let you up and leave
Do your thang MaryJane mess with all my folks–got 'em high
For the days that they were lost and broke–shit got 'em by
Only right was stopping it from props

Put a cancer stick up in your mouth–or grab a brew
Sold in stores but the fact remains is–they the blame
And the government's been taxin' that (   )-- gettin' paid
If it's taxable it's cool to smoke--kill or not
And the alcohol is killin' folks– true or not
Other people try to make you bad--but I know you not
When my situation's lookin' sad I know I got
A true friend in my time of need–all I need
Your natural you come from seeds–I decree
Makes me happy when I'm feelin' pain
Once again makes me happy just to hear your name

Anything you've always kept me tame–and its plain

Are we on the radio dukes?
Awww yeah, give it to me
Yeah, at night I can't sleep
I'm tossin' and turnin'
I still got the candlesticks burnin'
It ain't changed but it's a different time
And I'm still playin' tricks with my mind
My mothers always stressin' that I'm livin' wrong
But I got my Smith and Wesson so I'm gettin' grown
And their lookin' at your little boys success
And I been thinkin', I'm dealin' with too much stress
So I stay up on my p's and q's
And watch out for the G's and fools
Cause the homies that I thought I had
See me stackin' up a grip
And they just started talkin' bad
So I stay away from outsiders
And when I wrote them, it makes 'em open they mouth wider
I used to think that you was my one and only homie
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me
Yeah
Dear diary I'm havin' a little trouble with my mind state
How many bullets would it take to change my mind? wait
Sometimes I want to end it but I don't though
They tell me see my pastor but I don't go
Cause they all be on this one street
So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
And give my money to the most needy
And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
Cause their puttin' a price tag on a man's word
And it's a fashion show, so the men flirt
The world is endin' so they try to make us switch fast
And they openin' up these churches for some quick cash
And usin' the money fo' they new cribs
While brother Johnson just got kicked out where he lived
I follow no man, cause man be phoney
My mind was playin' tricks on me
My mind was playin' tricks on me
Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't seem to keep my mind on a steady track
I'm all about gettin' mine so I study that
But it seems they want to get me
So I try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
Just in case they want to see a homies head blown
But I got to stay around to see my kids grown
I finally found a woman who could deal wit me
Back then I had a woman who wouldn't real wit me
And now she's back with her old lady
And now I got it goin' on and they sure hate me
Now I'm a gone and she's alone
hahahaha, her mind was playin' tricks on her
One time for your motherfuckin' mind
Bringin' it back like this here
1-9-9-1 all the way to the 1-9-9-4 and they me Face
My mind was playin' tricks on me

Deep in the heart of South Park lurks a stalker
S.A. fool, native Houston South Parker
Born and brought up to be a heartless motherfucker
No one else to blame, fuck it blame it on my mother
When I was growin up nobody seemed to give a shit
and that's what makes me one hard son of a bitch
Since they ain't give a shit, I ain't give a shit either
Sweet 16, time to stack me up some ki's
Learned the game of hustlin, fuckin dopefienders
Sellin niggaz beat, in other words amphetamines
My game was more advanced, sellin speed I'm goin broke
Got em up with Floyd and Floyd had fronted me some dope
Learned to rock it up, now I got it sold

Uh oh I got a beep I think my boys are out of crack
Everything was smooth, exactly how I played it
A dollar to be made, best believe a nigga made it
Nickels dimes and twenties, and sixty cent bumps
Nigga rollin hard, stackin paper like Trump
and I ain't give a fuck I told you that from the jump
Didn't worry about no static I had a motherfuckin pump
Ass out of line, word em up a nigga sprayed em

Six hundred bucks a motherfuckin hour

Brought my brother Warren Lee down from New Jersey
He helped me for a minute then he started screwin up

I guess he doesn't realize the bitch is fuckin me
It really doesn't matter, cause Ac'll never tell
He can stay broke, but I got dope to sell
I step out on the cut, shit was lookin funny
I ran back in the house and started callin up my money
I signaled for my workers, to bring in all the dope
I can feel the bust and sure enough in comes the 5-0
Niggaz stayed relaxed but they was friskin niggaz up
If someone said my name then I was definitely fucked
But I'ma play it cool, if I kill I gotta kill
Fightin for my shit, I never ran and never will

Don't want to know or see what its about

Watch out for the snakes and fakes
Out to take what's yours so prepare and beware

Money makes the world kill all niggers quicker

The cheddar, whatever you call it its all ???

A lot might even sacrifice their life to retrieve it

Money's good to me
Money can't buy me love
But it can rent me some pussy
You get your hands on a little bit of it and before you know it
You go crazy without, do strange things for it
Although its made of paper, it don't grow on trees
Unless you coming up blowin weed, while you smoke on tweeds
You see money makes the world go round
Makes the price of living go up
Chances of living go down
You see money makes the world go round

But when you come up than they hound you

But where the southwest be, that's why I sip on a quart
You see my mind is on a whole lot more than just rap
You see you got to be something, until this rap shit happen

Its been addictive, my daughter can't get what she needs
Shit is fucked up, you wonder why we rob and sell dope
I go days without eating, it ain't because I snort coke
Fool I'm broke, what's a good way to get paid these days
Flip burgers, or lay your ass down and get sprayed
Hey man I got to reason with ya
Naw, fuck trying to reason
I'm tired of struggling so now its hunting season

I don't give a FUCK about the chatter in the background

If you don't know, I recommend you check
And ask them motherfuckers, how many heads I put to rest
I play a game but the game ain't roulette
Slangin cane is the thang and I beat
That there's a lot of wannabe Scarfaces
I've heard the name in ninety-nine different places
I'm here to squash it all original will speak

I left my cut, in fear of a prison term
They wanna put me in a chair and let me burn
But go to prison on a murder rap, fuck that
I refuse to be a visitor in state's camp
So I broke and left behind all I worked for
Either that or be sentenced for a drug war
And many want to know why I've slowed up
It's either that or get fucked
Cause laws get happy on the trigger
Say fuck it put a cap in a nigga
But this ass ain't made for no caps homey

Waitin for the day to make a comeback
And now I'm ready for combat

Back in the South Park, six o'clock on the dot
Checkin on my old rock spot

Heh, the small timers see me so they jet
Buildin one-twenty-eight
I got myself a bag and I can't wait
To cut em up small to make a profit
Niggaz on the cut short stop it
Fiends'll see em small then they go
Where, to see the motherfuckin pro
One nigga got pissed
And started reachin for his shit
Three-fifty-seven on your ass fool
Like I said before, you don't get a second chance dude
Unloaded on his ass he was hurt
Six shots put his dick in the dirt
Laid him out like a motherfuckin rug
Gettin pumped full of thirty-eight slugs
Some other niggaz stepped out y'all
Aww shit, I had to make a phone call
Hello?
Hay Jay
Whassup?
I'm in a little trouble man
Where you at?
I'm out here in South Park Village
Stay right there, I'll be right on
C'mon let's take these motherfucers to war main
Jay called up some niggaz from the 5th Ward
And came back with a motherfuckin hit squad
Motherfuckin uzi machine
Big Chief packed an M-16
Will and AK with a banana clip
And little Bill had a god damn pistol grip
I hit a little laugh and got me a buzz
And that's about the time they got drugged
One more war took place
You can call me the shit started, or call me Mr. Scarface

Verse Three:
Damn, check this shit out
Later on, all alone, you know what happened next
Another bitch came by to give me sex
It was kind of strange I was thrown off
The last bitch got her head blown off
But fuck I ain'tsta pass up no pooty
She started strippin at the door, oh goody
I got in that ass with the quickness
Fuckin her down with the diznick
I didn't have to pretend I loved her
All she wanted me to do was just fuck her
So I gave it up to the lady
And all she said was 'Fuck me baby, fuck me baby'
I started stroking in an outrage
The whole while I was starin at my twelve gauge
The bitch was makin noise I said I'm killin her
And all the while my dick was hard and he was still in her
I made a nut as she fell to the floor
I heard a knock on the front door
I grabbed the twelve gauge from the bed head
Who is it?  (Fred)  Who?
Who the fuck is Fred, I stood by the door
By that time someone jumped in the window
Now what the fuck was I do?  *bam bam bam*
The bitch packed a twenty-two
Hit him in his head, there she laid him
The nigga standin by the door I sprayed him *automatic fires*
And headed for the back
I seen that same old brown cadillac
It kinda fucked me up at first
Cause the nigga that drove that caddy rode away in a hearse
I opened up fire on the ride G
Who I was shootin for was standin right behind me
I had a double barrel pointed at my ass
Could this be the end of Mr. Brad?
I don't know what happened to the slut
Well that's about the time the closet door it opened up
*kicked open* On your ass trick!
I'll be damned if I go out like the last bitch!
Heh, five-oh's on my ass main
They know me by the face, but they don't know my last name
Now I'm back on the case
Yeah, just call me Mr. Scarface

[ continues through intro ]
Hey
Shit
Yeah nigga, that's
That - that - that
This - this is some - ehm
What we gon' call this one here?
Fuck it
Let's call it - ehm
Some - some
Some old school Scarface freestylin
Youknowmsayin?
Yeah
Aaaaah shit!
I'm finna freestyle in this bitch
He-yeah
Huh youknowmsayin?
Check it out
[ VERSE 1 ]
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pushin rocks on the block, I'm never broke, mayn
But now I'm up against some mo' shit
Because the five-o's done jumped in my face with some hoe shit
Tried to mix a nigga up in a homicide
Said I shot a muthafucka in his mama's ride
I ain't the nigga in the trench coat
I don't push rocks on the block, I deal the big dope
I ain't the nigga on the mic that done said he quit
But I be damned if I get popped for some petty shit
That's why I move the real chickens
So if I'm goin down, I'm comin home on a meal ticket
Cause in this game you can't bar shit
Do your dirt on the cool, so they can't say they saw shit
So when them muthafuckas step up with that he-say
You can tell em hoes to hit the freeway
Cause I ain't touchin shit with my own hands
I leave the dirt to be done by the next man
And count my money when they push it off
I wonder if the dope game is still bein good to y'all
Cause in the past four years, yo
I done clocked more cash sellin dope than them white folks
That's the reason why they upset
And always tryin to mix a nigga up in some fuck shit
But I'm a killer comin atcha
Mr. Scarface Part III, nigga, The Final Chapter
He-he-he
Just freestylin in the studio, though
Where is Scarface?
Where is Scarface?
(Here I am
Here I am)
How much do you make, Sir?
(I don't -
Man, what the fuck is you talkin bout how much I make?!)
Ha-ha-ha..
(Fuck you!)
[ VERSE 2 ]
I'm in the South Park, peepin out the territory
Finna set up shop just like in every story
So I'm rentin out the backside
And let them niggas do they work, and me, I'm kickin back, right?
And layin low in the next section
Got a fully automatic M-11 for my protection
Everything is goin smooth as planned
I gots to try to fool the man
Cause if I'm caught, I'm doin 10 flat
So I'm gettin it while the gettin's good, nigga, fuck that
Cause if I fall short, nigga, then I'm ass out
And then we'll see what the judge try to pass out
I see some niggas we competin with
It's goin down tonight in the village, and I can see this shit
So I'm on the telephone callin up the squad
""Get your shit together, nigga, we finna mob""
Before I hung up the phone, niggas was lettin loose
I grabbed my shit and tried to find my bullet-proof
But fuck it, niggas, ain't goin for the chit-chat
They startin off with a headshot
So if I gotta die, then I gotta die, nigga
And when I fall on my ass, don't ask me why, nigga
It was just my time and the man came to get me
Fuck it - plus a bullet hit me
A straight niggaroe subtractor
Mr. Scarface Part III, muthafucka, The Final Chapter
The final chapter for real
(All I have in this world..)
Yep
He-he
I gotta - ehm
Shit, I guess I better talk about a broad then, huh?
Before I close this muthafucka off, right?
Check it out
[ VERSE 3 ]
Later on, all alone, sat around the house layin low
Waitin for these niggas to jump so I can buck a hoe
And just like I expected
A bitch came by in a gee wantin to get naked
Now shit's gettin hectic
The situation's lookin grim, so yo, I gots to check it
Clean those traps, all the other shit
I'm fuckin one hoe, and in comes another bitch
So now I'm jackbonin two hoes
Who's the nigga in the Kamurshol? Fuck, nigga, who knows?
She musta knew the bitch that I was fuckin with
And plus I'm strapped and she was suckin dick
Up and down with a smooth stroke
Takin 9 inches of this dick like a deep throat
The other bitch was involved in masturbation
Oh shit - now I'm ejaculatin
I let loose and they was fightin for the white shit
I got a rubber tryin to make my pipe fit
I finally made the cock crack
The bitch pulled a .330 and shoved it up my back
Then some niggas came out with a chainsaw
And tried to hack my muthafuckin brains off
These bitches set me up, y'all
Pussy - a nigga's quickest downfall
I couldn't do shit except take it like a man
But if I live, it's on again
But I wanted a quick piece
So I put down my piece and end up put down, deceased
She put the rifle to my muthafuckin head
Mr. Scarface is - naw, fuck that shit..
Ah-ha-ha
Youknowmsayin?
Punch the beat in

(Verse One)
Niggas get stomped when they step with that bullshit
If you got a firearm, go ahead and pull it
Cause I'ma put it dead on ya ass when you reach
I got a little friend on my shoulder that I think you wanna meet
A 9 millimeter, that will stop him
Get his ass focused, once I focus him I drop him
Boy you should of known not to fuck with me bitch
Brothers like me will make ???? rich
So if you got something that you think you wanna prove
You better prove it now, cause you don't get a second chance dude
One chance is all you get
And if I beat you to the draw, that's it
Get your momma's black dress and call your family
It's gonna be a murder, my reason insanity
(Verse Two)
I was born with a chip on my shoulder
Now that I'm older, momma's talking shit but I told her
""Mind your fucking business"" I love the girl to death
But I don't wanna hear it, save your fucking breath
I know my time is coming, and I ain't gonna lie
I may be scared of Jason, but I'm not scared to die
So when a nigga talk shit, and I buck 'em
Shoot me in the head, put me a box, and just say ""fuck 'em""
Later on that day I heard gunshots
Watching niggas running (Aiyo that nigga got shot)
Ran to the corner said ""What happened my brother?""
He just laid there shaking, bleeding like a muthafucka
God damn!! ""Who would let that off to him?""
Man: Some niggas from your hood, Triple ?????
Get your shit together, we're heading for the village
I think its time to pay them hoes a little visit
Them niggas don't understand me
It's gonna be a murder, my reason insanity
(Verse Three)
Pulled up in a Rider, trailer full of niggas
Mack 10, Tech 9's, all with fingers on the trigger
Backed in the bitch like I was staying
Opened up the trailer, *gunshots* South Park started spraying
Bullets flying everywhere, niggas getting struck
Had dope in the village, but I didn't give a fuck
Shoot the bitch up, then I'ma leave her
If I can't sell my dope, then you can't either
Now here's a valueable lesson to learn
You fuck with mine, you get burned
Headed for the nigga who shot my partner
*Gunshot* Shot his father
Walkin' through the living room tearing up shit
He's loading up his pistol, ain't that a bitch
You should of had it loaded, he said ""Come on Scarface, hold it
I won't do it again man"" Yeah, I know it
I told you when you take mine, I take yours
Hands in the air, fell to the floor
""Please don't shoot Scarface""
I looked him in the eye - then I shot him in his face
A sucka's way out is to steal 'em
My dad said ""Always look a man in the eye before you kill him""
It had to be a murder, them hoes couldn't handle me
""What's your reason man?"" - Insanity

hit the bass line, yo Vice what you're doin' man
straight up, ugh
I'm too deep to quit, and too strick to fold
and you need to split nigga G into code
come on, these years to teach, homey speak to know it
bodybag what we're talkin' about, you weak, you row
the game is overcrowded so we fight for space
neighbourhood show the hustle, still we grind to win
tryin' to find a way, to come up on 2 pounds of yay
and double up it, ain't never happened touch it
a lot of niggaz focued on they candy paints
and that was in the grills, steering wheels and grand
but I ain't trippin' out here, flippin' I just need to thank
money miny, yo all the mission tryin' to steal me bank
ride and homicides we get it, fuck it, peepin' in horn
killin' all these pussy niggaz think they keepin' in God
Pistol cocked on the block and all they fearin' is death
then again nigga, roaddog you feelin' me yet
so if I die, I'm tryin' to get it mamma, barely deed
and pray to God that he kept this spot hell me
sad as fuck, what the nigga stuck down the raw
bust friends, back in the prison, foundin' rock to the troup
here I smoke and tryin' to hide it but was played by the rule
and if live like the gold fiend then you'd do what they do
I'm on my own limits sold buck words
all alone in the ghetto, deep in weed, sweat in Jelly Nose
worrey eyes, you either do it or you die
crimin' in flood, ridin' your blood, cause this is your life...
Chorus
our golden law, now foes or friends
I'm on my own, no hoes, no ends
I been smillin' but I can't innovate
I feel that hurt but I can't explain it
I have been around with a player or two
and still ??Hurricane can be, ??
?? loose when you pumped the face
real nigga blues and it hold your aims
you're bold or fold no in betweens
console your seems don't blow your creams
also don't you loose your dreams
this is my life, this is my life
I just got word: my uncle done died
but ain't no tears on my face cause I done already cried
I been here before, dead to me is not new
my heart safe it, mamma don't, cops too
I got my best to get my purpose to the Lord
but sometimes this shit be fuckin' with me hard
and I'm heartless, I'm a kid again
lookin' out my window watchin' niggaz get murdered
in college worked the parties, step with??, drink ??
just to get through the night
go to school only the anchor stomach givin' you fight
cause sure there were fights and I was bustin' like a the sun bitch
the smartest nigga on the block live in ??kick
the convicts with worry ?? hard to ?? to the tails
searchin' for heaven and livin' in hell
they say I'm wrong for teaches this on
fuck what you believe, can't heal by myself
that's the way I'm livin', this is my life

this is my life, this is my life
I only got one eye but I see things ever so clear
been acquainted with death but I never know fear
I still roll to spots, cats scared to go there
if it's a heaven for a G, if not, prepare to go there
I live for today and not promise tommorrow
smoke weed and set lead and try to dry my sorrows
in this game of life ain't no rules to follow
and if I come to lie for them it's a hard heal to swallow
I'm still the smallest cat with the biggest rep in H-Town
stress in my life is gettin' hard to take down
havin' visions of cats rollin' in my weight now
it feels like I'm about to have a nervous break down
it takes a big man to share this pride
tryin' to get my soul right and put the brain inside
y'all niggaz are so scared to ride
they got it from Still I alive to Why I Feel So bad inside
this is my life....

And I would never make a promise, that I know I couldn't keep
And I would, never testify, cop out for a plea
Or surrender information on my boys to the police
And you could, never catch me on the block without a strap
And I would, never pull it out unless I'm bouts to black
And I could, never forget my homies dyin for they scratch
Forever pourin out liquor for 'em, God send me back
and I'll, never shed tears, my heart is like a stone now
Never thought I'd live to see 21 look I'm grown now
Never say never they tell me all the time
Cause never means it's forever, but it's never crossed my mine
And I'll, never go broke, I promise I'ma shine
Never come short on my issue, I'm on it every time
And I'll, never be past it, you better gimme me mine
It's my money, and I want it, every motherfuckin dime
No I, never forgot all my struggles in the past
And I could, never forget how to hustle for my cash
And I will, never forget how I felt when I saw Brad
take that first breath and from then, I knew I had to mash
And it could, never be said I went out like a hoe
Never been punked, I'll never let it slide, never let it go
Never ever, never ever ever no
Get on my level hoe, or get a shovel hoe
It's never any question for my manhood I get down
I'll never switch, never snitch, never sit down
I'll never hesitate to squeeze a nigga six rounds
I'll never squat to take a piss, who's the bitch now
I never ran, I never will, I ain't never scared
It's in my bloodline, the realest nigga ever bred
And that's some of the realest shit that I done ever said
And I can die but through my lyrics, I ain't never dead
I'll never disrespect my momma, never disrespect her momma neither
I'll never turn my back on Jesus
I'll never get caught off in the system, cause I believe a
man that follows man, ain't no man, and I'm a leader
Never go turncoat my nigga, I could never trade
I'll never cross my homies out, that I ain't how I'm made
And I never had not one regret, on how I was raised
I'm from the ghetto, where I slung and rapped it every day
Never knew no other way, this ain't gon' never change
Never gon' bite my tongue, FUCK what nigga say
100 with myself I swore to God I'd stay the same
And when I finally got my paper, I was on my game
I'll never talk a nigga down, do yo' thang dawg~!
Never hate a dude for tryin, that's insane dawg
Get yo' motherfuckin money, that's the thang dawg
Too many homies dyin young, feel my pain y'all

Verse 1:
He greets his father with his hands up
Rehabilitated slightly, glad to be the mans child
The world is different since he seen it last
Outta jail been seven years and he's happy that he's free at last
All he had was his mother's letters
Now he's mobile and he's gotta make a changed and make it for the better
But he's black so he's got one strike against him
And he's young plus he came up in the system
But he's smart and he's finally makin' eighteen
And his goal's to get on top and try to stay clean
So he's callin' up his homie who done came up
Livin' lavish now they dealin' wit' the same stuff
And had that attitude that who he was was worth man
And with that fucked up attitude he killed his first man
Now its different he done did dirt
And realized killin' men meant comin' up
But it still hurt
And can't nobody change this
It's 1994 and we up against the same shit
I never understood why
I could never see a man cry
Until I see a man die
Chorus:
Face: A man cry
Verse 2:
Imagine life at its full peak
Then imagine lyin' dead in the arms of your enemy
Imagine peace on this earth where there's no grief
Imagine grief on this earth where there's no peace
Everybody's got a different way of endin' it
And when your number comes for souls then they send it in
Now your time has arrived for your final test
(I see the fear in your eyes and in your final breath)
How much longer will it be 'till its all done?
Total darkness at ease be it all one
I watch him dying when he dies, let us celibrate
You took his life but your memory you'll never take
You'll be headed to another place
And the life you used to live will reflect in your momma's face
I still gotta' wonder why
I never seen a man cry
Untill I seen a man die
Chorus: 2x
I hear you breathin' but your heart no longer sounds strong
But you're kinda scared of diein' so you hold on
And you keep on blackin' out and your pulse is low
Stop tryin' to fight the reap but just relax and let it go
Because theres no way you can fight it but you'll still try
And you can try it till you fight it but you'll still die
Your spirit leaves your body and your mind clears
The rigimore starts to set now you're outta' here
You start your journey into outer space
You see yourself in the light but you still feelin' outta' place
So you're standin' in the tunnel of eternal life
And you see the ones you never learned to love in life
Make the choice let it go and you can back it up
If you ain't at peace with God you need to patch it up
But if you're ready close your eyes and we can set it free
There lies a man not scared to die may he rest in peace
I still got to wonder why
I never seen a man cry
'Till I seen that man die

B. Sieg baby, I'm back up in this bitch like what
Fresh out the pen, once again I'm here to grab my nuts
I am hell for real - you doubt it nigga? call my bluff
Only respect men that's real, you coward rat-ass fucks
Who raised you niggaz? Yo father probably hate yo guts
Mad he didn't double up, and that Lifestyle bust
Ya lifestyle fucked, ya duckin, every corner tryna clap at you
Plus fuck ya mother, the bitch ain't shit for havin you
What? If you don't like what I'm sayin, fuck ya attitude
Same lame probably showed these rap niggaz gratitude
Huh, happy they ain't snitch on you
Must I remind yo monkey ass what a bitch might do?
They act like they got yo back to infiltrate yo rest
Then have you talkin +Through The Wire+ like Kanye West
To all my real niggaz trapped homey, mind yo tongues
Cuz these cowards comin home after firin they ones (?)
I never snitch
[Chorus x2]
[The Game]
Snitch niggaz, bitch niggaz, they all the same face
No matter what hole you crawl in, nigga you ain't safe
All you niggaz is rats, nicknamed Jake
Sam, Curtis or Alpo belong in the same place
A penitentary cell block gettin gang raped
Coward motherfucker, now tell me how my name taste
I leave you bleedin like ya period came late
Red bandana on, call that my Game Face
Niggaz come in all shapes
Some snitches wear Reeboks, some wear Bathing Apes
Sometimes they Crip niggaz, other times Piru
And some snitch niggaz look just like you
I promise to never snitch, like some of my homies
G-Rock, B-Mase, and O.G. Tony
Before I have the police run in ya house
I kiss my son on the cheek and put the gun in my mouth, motherfuckers

An eye for an eye, so now your life is what you owe me
Look deep into the eyes of your muthafuckin killer
I want you to witness your muthafuckin murder, nigga
And since you wants to kill, then your ass has got to fry
But ain't no police, therefore your ass has gots to die
We play the game for keeps and if you slept I guess you sleep
You sho nuff fucked and now your ass is six feet deep
Cause where I come from, yo, everybody's got a gat
And niggas try your ass just to see where you got your heart at
And if your shit is flimsy, then your ass is gonna bend
And like I said before there'll be no tears in the end
I'm rollin through your hood, now my heart is filled with anger
You at your sister's house and now your sister's life in danger
(By a total stranger) with the ?kanga?
Niggas wanna bang ya and hang ya
Sting ya with one up in the chamber
Let's take a trip up Holloway
So you can see how many niggas in my hood is down to die today
We standin up for our own shit
And if you outside the click, then you die, bitch
It ain't no love in this muthafucka
It ain't no love for yourself or your other brother
Because we real with this shit, so we stay true
And since we bang, we do what O.G.'s say do
I've got the mind of the man in the mirror
So I'm lookin at me vaguely
But I can't seem to fade me
I've got my pistol pon cock
Ready to lick shots non-stop
Until I see your monkey-ass drop
And let your homies know who done it
Cause when it comes to this gangsta shit
you muthafuckas know who run it
So when you put this muthafucka to the test
You gotta realize somethin, nigga: (you fuckin with the very best)
I've got this killer up inside of me
I can't talk to my mother, so I talk to my diary
I'm goin off on the deep end
I find myself face to face with myself while I'm sleepin
I see your picture in my head and my hand shake
You can run, you can hide, but there's no escape
My inner feelings show no mercy on my enemy
I got to get this muthafucka before he gets to me
So in your own blood you'll bathe
And I won't stop until I put this muthafucka in his fuckin grave
And I can say this once again
You can cry but you'll still die, there'll be no tears in the end

and any mutha fucker want pain I brought the full bottle
now take ya two of these and call me in the morning
three times point blank range wit no warning
Nigga I'm straight killa slash for show drama

You bust your caps when you rap

And this is always all day killa
and bitches who be stressin me out I get rid of
I'm still a guerilla in these goddamn streets

The one MC who told you niggas once
and after that he gave no warning he straight done him- punk
I got my mind all made up to go off
when bitches start to threaten my life I go off
Take a walk on the wild side
and all the coloreds go whoop whoop
when I come down in my coupe
And mutha fuckers hatin me come give it a try
but 99.9 of the times you gon' die
wit no warnin
Dealing wit the killer wit the strap out
No warnin -then
All fo a sudden homie blacks out
wit no warnin
And now your dealing with your outer body energy

How can one spit the game so sure

A new day, brings a new problem to a brother
and all I gots ta say is thank god for my mother
cause without my mommy dear my life would've been joke
either locked up playin' dead and still slangin' dope but nope
The lord he had a plan for me
and with his help, my mother made a man of me
didn't blindfold me to the world we was livin' in
taught me how to save my little dividends
so when I graduated I'd have a little school money
but in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy
and flunked outta school with the flag pole
and left my mother dear at home with a sad soul
because my mother worked the fingers to the bone
cause we was alone, and me I bought a death home
My real pops he broke out with the style
so I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child
So now we livin' comftable
taught me the game and how to be responsible
But back then I couldn't see it
I wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'
and ended up in a big fight
and told me not to come home until I got my shit right
So now I'm livin' in my grandma's home
my grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own
and keepin' me ain't no big deal
but now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels
being kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no
even though my grandfather just had a stroke
and now the money's low
and pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go
or either try to find a job so I can help out
I'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out
and when I get out I gotta try to pave the way
so my family can have a better place to stay
I'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short
I can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope
and now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong
she just prayin' for me heavily
take care of her grandson
and the lord must of heard her prayer
cause he made me get a grip
and got me on up outta there
I heard my mother say them streets is gonna kill ya
you couldn't have told me nothin' back then
but now I feel ya...
I'm eighteen, and now I'm havin' big fun
my baby's mother just had my first son
May eleven, I never will forget the day
A star's born, let's name him little Scarface
My first born and yo I'm a proud father
I gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father
and sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead
but what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed
I buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part
and he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard
I buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys
because the Tonka toys will only punk my boy
and I don't want my son to look at life
through a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like
but yet and still I let my son be a kid
just give him up the real, exactly like my momma did
So when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate
the game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate
and now my son is four years old
I really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role
because these years he'll remember most
so it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close
but I got a buncha obstacles
if it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle
Now everybody's got my baby
wantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy
""It's your daughter, don't she look like you?""
I just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do
because my mother knows the real deal
all these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal
So now we in and outta cope
tryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the child support
Tellin' her friends that she's breakin' me
now eveybody knows, that she was just fakin' G
Come to find out, the girl never had me
she's the baby's mother but me I ain't the baby's daddy
and biological tests can prove
you gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude
but now I finally got a real daughter
no need for the testin'
I know that I'm the baby's father
I heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya
you couldn't have told me nothin' back then
but now I feel ya...
I feel ya...
Now I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life
It's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife
and got a bigger stick to fight with
I'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick
because we livin' in a concentration set
and everyday, we face to face with death
I seen my homies go and come
and judgement day is just somethin we can't run from
so I know my number's comin' up
so I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up
and even though I hate killin' off my own kind
I gotta be a man and as a man I'm a defend mine
My brother corners tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
don't fight each other, we gots ta stand and fight the beast
so united we stand but we gonna fall quick
because we always tryin to take another brother's shit
and the cops is in the same vote
just because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope
They shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods
they shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
and now the story's all twisted up
and if they gave the cop the chair
I really wouldn't give a fuck
because she left my partner's family with memories
and after hearin' this I know you don't remember me
but yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
I see his parents and then I started breakin' up
because I know what you did was wrong
but you won't realize until you dead and gone
It ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning
you straight up shot him from behind
but all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back
you give a gat to a black he don't know how to act
but you gotta tell your story to the judge
not the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves
and if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
then in reality you took care of your business
but regardless I know you wanna kill me
but I ain't goin' out like dat
Ya feel me?
...yeah

Stupid ho's that I use to fuck around wit
Way back, see a nigga now and they say that I changed
Put another notch in the game
You watchin the range, i'm floatin
And ain't no stoppin the rain
Cock and I aim, I see you bitches jockin the name
Boppin to fame, a crooked nigga droppin in pain
Rockin a cain, back up bitch, you blockin my lane
Tryna foul on a nigga cause you hot in the flame
Fuck you, and them ho ass nigga's you run wit
Fuck your whole street, you ain't no motherfuckin O.G.
Cause O.G. means, means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin man
Ain't no police or judges
Just nigga's holdin grudges
You mark ass bitches is low budget
Straight traitor's, so fuck you and the glass that you puff on
Don't smile in my face, when you see me get the fuck on
Dope fiend ass nigga, tryna to get a free check
Talkin that shit, but you's a motherfuckin bitch
So when you see a nigga on the flip duke
I'll flip you, you must be smokin dip fool
Nothin but a bitch fool

""Means, Means you a original gangsta
Understand pure motherfuckin man""

Call baretta's on my dog, nigga's get sweated for they shit
If all a law enforcement, nigga's get deaded for that shit
Thought you was a street nigga, pulled a heat nigga at that
Come to find out was a cunt that got slapped, and didn't scrap
Cuz, you know what motherfuckers like you do wit nigga's on the set
Finish fuckin face and leave ya clean cut shirt wet, and jet
Cuz, I'll smack the shit outta ya bitch ass you wanna run to the one's
Tell em about the cash and the stash, and were I got my guns
And you know i'm the bird man, cause I sold so much coco
Beware of the crack pipe, that's by far in ya life
I got heroin by the balloons, kabooms, and mushrooms
And my 38.specialist puttin banker's in they tomb's
I'm one, shot, killed, and these bullets all go
And you takin finger print's, and mugshots photo's
I use to beat bitch nigga's till they face turned blue
But they get weak in dice water, and pedal you in the sue
And it's true
[Chorus: 5x]

Fuck all these bitches and these punk ass nigga's

Shake, crack, and brake, no mistake nigga
Fuck em, stick em, stuck em, Chucks laced nigga
Fat laced nigga, blue fat laces nigga
Me and the homie's all on paper chase nigga
Kurupt Young Gotti, 6-4-4-5 me

[Verse 4 - Daz]
On my side of the world it's lo-lo's and jheri curls
Smokin water by the pearl, runnin the street wit double earl's
I did it all 'fore I can see, walk, and crawl
Made it out the ghetto, bustin a male, so I can wet y'all
Took a while 'fore I ball
Wanted for eight or nine murder's and spoke came
For cocaine, raw game, another die for what he claim
And where I'm from they know my name, I cause lot's of static
Automatic's and canic's, and nigga's start to panic
Ain't no ruler's or leader's runnin the set
Outta respect we G's, YG'S, and O.G.'s connect
Fifteen, sixteen in a chevy we roll
Get you full of hole's, god dog, you scream echo's in fo-fo's
Who dare to mack wit the tarantula and scorpion
Brought you in the depth's of danger when I tortured it
I love it when the bustaz squealin
And they chrome start spillin
Then ya start the grinnin, and said that nigga Daz did it

[Verse 1]
When I was in the sixth grade, these niggas was bitch made
They was thinking science, I was thinking get paid
I always kept a plan to get doe
Like selling the same shit I use to steal from outta stop-n-go
I use to run a paper route
But that ain't pay me enough, I was still on the bus
My momma would always tell me don't you rush to get old
But rarely did I listen to the shit I was told
I was a ghetto boy long before the rap group existed
I use to take my lunch money and pitch it
I stayed on suspension, I ain't fuckin' with school
Truant officers be chasin' me, I'd give 'em the blues
Hit the pipes off of Roomer just to pass the time
Shoot the shit and walk to Shamrock, stole me a wine
Get smashed and hit the bus stop when school let out
Get off at tina house and bust that cot
Walk up outta Ridgemont smelling like fish in my pocket
Then back to the southside walking home from Watkins
I stopped to see the homies off of Huckala street
All you game in the front yard bumpin' this beat
[Chorus: Z-Ro]
Ever since I could remember I been on my grind,
All the time
Nothing but paper and pussy and the finer things on my mind
I had to Shine
By any means necessary I had to go out and get it
And come back wit it, thug life I was wit it
My balls and my word told a nigga that the world was mine
That's why I stay on the grind
[Verse 2]
I remember when the dope game started up, serving the hypes
I was seeing more doe than I ever seen in my life
I was rocking up eightballs and knowing the shake
Kept a thousand in my pocket, twenty more in the safe
I had my grandmother guessing how I got that shit
'Cause every other day I had to buy new kicks
Older cats steppin' to me as if I was the man
Getting telephone calls from my uncle's friends
I'm sixteen years old, with game so throwed
I was parking niggas frontin' me and fucking they hoes
Eventually I moved out, rented a house
I'm stretching the dope, cuttin' seventeen from an ounce
We cop ya pots fulla spray, I'm moving big weight
But that was back in the days, nobody thought about a dope case
It's all mapped out, get in get out
They giving mutha fuckas ten years for each rock
It's fucked ain't it, but I'm lookin' at the picture they done painted
They hanging all these niggas who's careers was dope gamin'
The crack epidemic had you locked if you was in it
And even if you stepped out with bread you couldn't spend it
In the beginning niggas had they whole hoods flooded
Wit that Antonio Montana disease like ""fuck it""
And drug wars just another day in the life
You fucked over me, I fucked you, done gave me the right
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I'm up and down I-10, with a car full of hens
Finta check my ends, finta get this Benz
Stopped short of my drop spot by red lights flashing
I'm dirty, and if he wants to search I'ma blast him
I roll the windows down so I can show him my hands
Wouldn't you know, the cop done pulled me over my man
I got a brand new plan take this shit to the line
Stop an Sony's and give it back I'll give you a dime
With ten thousand you can go to work for a week
Take some time off to think, I'll even throw in a key
He stopped at the mo', I gave him the doe
Checked in my room then whooped out the scale and the blow
There's a knock at the door, I grabbed the four-four
It was the homeboy who set me up down on the floor

That bitch ain't no good
[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Look at your face all frowned up
The only thing you got goin for ya is your fake tits and round butt
You're a rich nigga's worst mistake
You're just a trophy, and what make matters worse you're fake
A mall broad tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Whatever they wear in the videos, you want it
You tryin to find the nigga with the biggest contract
To get you pregnant, so you can ride around and get fat
And collect big money, with the baby all sharing
Got a 18-year career from child bearing
And only God knows what this kid'll go through
Got mixed feelings about his dad cause of you
The dollar signs popped up, that's what did it
And dude, he was just as fucked up cause he hit it
And now you out there buyin champagne for the club
To me that's kinda fucked up
[ CHORUS: Devin ]
Only your mother could love you
Much too freaky, you're easy
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I ain't never had to pay for mine
Only your mother could love you
Much too sneaky, you're freaky
And I wouldn't would fuck you
I wouldn't give a broke bitch a dime
[ VERSE 2: Devin ]
You used to turn up your funky-ass nose before I even stepped up
I guess fuckin with me just wouldn't keep your rep up
I used to think about you when I'd go sleep, even dream
Of fuckin you without a rubber, fillin your pussy with cream
But when I wake and see you again, it be the same old shit
I finally realized you just a plain old bitch
Started gettin my shit tight rockin shows every night
Gettin my dick sucked, fuckin hoes left and right
Workin hard to blow up, now you wanna show up
With your stretch mark titties and pussy lips all towed up
I heard you got married, that was it you thought
Until he kicked your ass and took back all the shit that he bought
Now you're lookin for a shoulder to lean on
Bitch, I sho' hate it, cause my shit is dis-located
You was the only one I was thinkin of
But now you got a face only your mother could love
[ CHORUS ]
Break it down
[ Devin ]
I can't do nothin for ya
Only your mother could love ya
I can't do nothin for ya
Aight, check this out
[ VERSE 3: Tela ]
Look, Young Tela a pimp by force, not a pimp by choice
See, these bitches ain't playin when it come to the courts
They'll fold you like some foil when it comes to support
And you niggas out here trickin like nature takes its course
I'ma spit it till you're fitted, it's your main employ
See, I was trained and I was taught that a pimp keeps a choice
But you lames gotta change when you gave the whore a port'
One weekend at the Allstar and the bitch bought a Porsche?
I ain't mad, girl, flip em, you can get em, look we did it
Cause his mind was all twisted off the aether from the clinic
Now hit it, oh lawdy, look at shawty
Mission hit your boy for a four and a forty
Miss done get your Ford for a house - ""Help me homie""
See, I can give a fuck about your loss cause you're phoney
You'se a lame and she seen it in your heart from the start
Why she ripped yo ass apart? It was lying in her cards
But eh, she'll only come up with another, I don't trust her
But she got one hell of a hustle
You black-hearted bitch, you are full of lies
So like go on and suck Young Tela and die

Yo Nod
What's up B-lo?
Hey man, niggaz tryin' to stir up shit between amongst us
and Chicago man, what you think about this shit?
Ah, between us and the Snypaz?
Man I'm talkin about us and every muh-fuckin body, man
Ah but you know we too tight up in Chicago
We got love worldwide baby don't stop, north, south, east and west
That's right, know what I'm saying, straight up comin to you
Snypaz and Do or Die, Rap-A-Lot mafia
From the Chi, here it go like this
[Verse 1]
I went from zip locks and bakin soda
To smokin herb, cookin 'ola
Never lookin overnight success
Cause I want a Rover
Hold you head up and stick yo chest out
And if you heavy off in this game then get yo vest out
I hit the scence like po-po's
In the four door Chevrolet, we gas
With hats broke off to the left
To show you exactly where you at
I want the scratch that you done say
Remember, bust a cap a lot
For the rooftop Snypaz snap a lot
Puttin down with Rap-A-Lot
You'll die, can't fuck with us
So when you say it, you'll a lie
You'll try and get shut down
From Texas all the way back to Chi
Ain't no success even if you cryin for it
Them niggas alive know it, they dyin for it
Even them niggas that kill, get caught, and strive for it
I strive for it
That's why I sixteen years and a positive
Try to let go of my negative
Only got one life to live
It's fucked up, only had one chance
And now I'm takin it
See niggas fakin it
If a nigga ain't real then his ass ain't makin it
Overnight, I had to do more than hold the mike
Had to control the fight
Had to make sure my dough was right
Had to make sure my boys was tight
Noise and lights, stalkin from the end of my (?) gonna spook ya
Horror type of tactics, you bet the Snypaz (?) knew ya
Stressed out, had me feelin left out
Stuck and I gotta get my self out
But when I was kid then crept out
Fuck all the ones who never helped out
Stepped out with grams and plans to be an overnight achiever
Since (....?....) to non-believers, overnight
[Chorus:] X 2
You can do what you wanna do
But it ain't gonna happen for you
Not overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
Overnight, overnight, overnight
[Verse 2]
Livin it up, this ain't no overnight shit
See (?) got a death wish
But Do or Die and Snypaz, represent Chi-Town
Took a life and get lit up quick
Rain niggas got me doin this
Used to be on some sell ass shit
Or mail that bitch back home in a box
And leave no trail of this
Now won't witness this and this is
How's it's gonna fall
All of y'all gonna battle
Leave this life, all shells gon drop tonight
You say that you want a spot
Better they hit like the shit from Rap-A-Lot
So pack that glock or AK stops your clock, my straps get hot
Even though it's hot it ain't hot enough to stop this entourage
Rain, Do or Die, pick a piece Snypaz, one big mob
Better stop that heart
Beuregard this industry from backyards to owin Lexus cars
So flex that shit cause down in Texas, everybody talks
Cause ain't gonna fall, overnight
[Rock Roc]
I got an american dream of gettin out the ghetto
Runnin out they mails
About the loved ones that said they love me, but didn't care
Do Roc scare? With the fuckin niggas who groundin me
It's Roc on the block, 45 glock cocked
Finna pop these niggas and they drop
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)
I'm screamin more and more and more war
Killa for scrilla and more war, more war (more war)
A to the muthafuckin K
Runnin through the gateway bustin at the niggas back
Uh, Ooo wee, whip a, nigga, wit his, own gat
Oh snap, you in the business, dump him in the tar
Point blank range, nigga I'm game, do anything
(..?..) , (..?..), hangin out the window
Me and my comrades take a nigga out his shoes
Rule number one, don't get it confused
I'm talkin bout that one three, s-h-o-t
Nine millimeter kill 'em off of me
Make 'em freeze
Kill for my nigga that'll kill for me
Infa, red, lights and bombs leave a bitch, a nigga his arms
Stay alarmed, Vietnam, when I closed caskets
Pimp, lyrical tactics, shit look hectic
When I bomb a bad bitch
1997 niggas, and you can't do it overnight

(Verse One)
Here it comes fool, I play a game where there's no rules
Homies on the cut call me Joe, cause I'm so cool
Quick to get a ??? with a nigga, I ain't dodgin' them
Win, lose, or draw in the hood, I'm squabbin' them
Representin' the Park since I'm living here
Walkin' through the hood from another set, get in here
And after the jackin', you still want more, heh
Fuck your posse, it's time for the corona
Don't fuck with the Park niggas ????
More niggas found dead here in my hood than in Vietnam
Rollin' seven deep to a car
Quick to take that ass to war, yo
It ain't no ??? being lost
Cause territory and rights are being enforced
So when you're rollin' up, ???? flow
And if a nigga flash a ???? keep going
Don't stop and sell your soul
You'll fuck around and get your ass P.D. roll
(Verse Two)
The last album past gold
And you wanna know the meaning of P.D. roll
Well I'ma break it down for you real clean
*gunshots* know what I mean
In other words getting blasted
Shootin' at a bastard, to see if he can last it
9 times out of 10 he can't
So that's one more nigga in the paint
You see, when I go to work
I hit a muthafucka where it hurts
Starting off at his home sight
And fuck up a nigga's whole night
You out of there, just like that there
For jumping in the ring with a bear
It's easily executed
Put the pistol to the head, cock the hammer back and shoot it
You can't get it no cleaner
Make a hit, break quick to the cleaners
And south ???? to the hole
And don't be no fool and get your ass P.D. roll
(Verse Three)
My own hood is confusing me
Shit just ain't what it used to be
I'm stepping back on my old block
The finest bitch in the hood smoking crack rock
Even the niggas I was raised with
Are walking around in a daze and shit
Man: ""Say now, can I get a dollar for a gold one?""
And got his hands out like I owe him
But I don't owe nann nigga
I was ??? in the hood until I got bigger
I hollered at my boys in the gang
And only a couple of them changed
Peace to Q-Dog, Cool Coin, and Old Mack
And all the rest of my boys down with ack
The rest ain't about jack
But I still love the hood, so it ain't about that
It's all about being down with it
Shit, to be got, you gotta go out and get it
Like my nigga doing time in the ???
Now that was a down muthafucka
A couple of ki's, my nigga stole
Straight up fucking P.D. roll
So lay it down in the dirt
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
That's how it is, and always will be
I had to have it, even if it killed me
The sight of losing didn't thrill me
So I had to go and steal G
Just to make a quick one
And I ain't give a fuck who fell short to be a victim
You and your family bro
Your ass out of line, your ass got P.D. roll

Clutching on steal triggers
Pouring kool-aid on hilfigers
For niggaz I cut for
Pull a hoe out my truck for
Take a bullet to my gut for
Shoot up your cuz for
And nigga you askin' me what for?
'cuz this check I wrote until death won't bounce
'cuz to quit is to care and excuses don't count
Yeah, the real nigga blues
Short sticks and long brooms
Two feet planted whether it be the tomb or the courtroom
Bullet wounds in my flesh
Powder burns I digest
On the front line I press
Until in peace I may rest
For battles I can't win
With stripes I must defend
Done been to the pen, behind friends
And I still can't turn my flags in
When you break weak I got to stand strong
I strive to go hard while you strive to go home
These checks I write are required day and night
For better or worse, ups and downs
Or just plain old fist fights
Packin' all the weight
Puttin' in work from birth
Running myself in the dirt
And you askin' me why my back hurt?
Even when your dad tried to give me some fish
I eighty-sixed that shit
Pulled your coat but you was scared to dismiss that bitch
But I guess you got to be one of me or walk in my shoes
Or drink from the cup that I drink to feel my blues
Yeah, the real nigga blues
I can't bend, brake, front, fraud, fold or get hacked
Its like I'm married to this game and my team looses if I get sacked
Turning down licks on niggaz I know ain't got no heart
Arguing with my baby momma because shes convinces you'z a mark
My word is my bond, my life is my son
My duece is my gun, and my fear is to have none
'cuz I refuse to run
And for my honor I'd die, and for my mother I'd lie
My heart done got hard
I still show regards, call out to the Lord
But it seems like I can't cry
So when bullets fly...
Yeah, its my fault
Locked in with no way out
Fuck some clout, this is what I'm about
Even if I am the only one to get caught
It ain't in me to back down
Thats like laying my gat down
Nigga I ride for the cause, and I hide from the laws
And I ain't scared to get ragged on
And for my crown... yeah
Caps gonn peal
I ain't no threat, nigga but I will kill
And to all my partners up under them hills
Y'all know how it feels and thats real
Yeah, dig these blues
The real nigga blues
Dig this
My partners hit a lick for two and a half bricks
And since I'm the cornerstone of the clique
They came to me when the shit got thick
I took in all their evidence and made it mine
Not realizing that while they were ballin'
I'd be doing time
All they had to do was push the witness out of existence
And I would've walked because the case was inconsistent
But insted they got caught up in the joys
Of the fruit from the hussle
Said fuck me, let the witness live
And I got twenty five years
All 'cuz I kept it real
A mark would've squeeled
But insted I chilled, put it on the pill
But got ?chofferred in? a deal
See I respect the code of the streets
The code of the ?jeeks?
But when they gave it to me they said 'Fuck the police'
We'll never help these hoes solve a case
Now tears in my sons face
Because his daddy is out of place
With no trace of my peers
Missing my little nigga younger years
All because I kept it real
Regrets?
Sometimes have some
I'ma walk when me time come
It wasnt my prints on the gun
In yo' eyes, you'z a real nigga
So what you would've done?
Stand strong?
I'm not surprised
I was in the county camoflauging my cries
Squabbling niggaz twice my size
For mistaking tears for fears in my eyes
But I ain't ask to be real
I was born like this
Sacrificing my fo' sho's for your maybes
Got me scorned like this
Tattered and torn like this
But my roots won't pluck
I'm the only reason your tooth won't buck
But is my authenticy worth the price I be paying?
All the shit I've been through
Nigga, do it look like I'm playing?
I'ma be down 'til I get laid down
All the ex-real niggaz would've still be real
Only if they would've stayed down
But these my blues
I just spread the news to who I choose
A tale of a real nigga
Can you dig his blues?
Yeah, the real nigga blues
And all I got are my balls and my word
Yeah, my balls and my word

Look out, we everyday grinding
Everybody in the North gotta love us down South 'cause we blindin'
And we don't trip the big diamonds
We mainly focus on the old schools with big blocks lying
And I been around the world in one day
Chucking up the duece for S.A.
I'm a hood cat, and that's for searching me a hood rat
With good cat, something beautiful to look at, fa sho
I kick it for my niggaz in the ghetto
And all my homies in the federal-
Lock up, behind the wall setting shop up
They beat the block up, yet and still they couldn't stop us
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta back at it
Cause I'm the last of the Dons, God damm it
I hear ya talking, but I don't cater to the chit-chat
But when I see you in the streets I got ya get back (word)
It ain't enough protection on ya ass, to fuck wit Brad

I showed ya, the Northside niggaz roll deep

How can a nigga from the South get a pass in every section
And walk the projects with no protection
Be surrounded by a mob, and not get robbed
Considered to be a savior, and not be God (Whoa)
Listen to the nigga flow now
I can speed it up or slow down
Face the facts baby, I got it locked like this and like that baby
Southern rap/rock baby
The last of a dying, we born again
The vicous life religous, I was born to win
The closoure after the greatest hit the sofa
When I still ride for Prince like a soldier
The two-thousand millenium comes
Since I'm the son of the father, that makes me the Don

And on and on, and on and on and on and on
Like clockwork, we hit these niggaz where it hurt
Knock they dicks in the dirt
Now you the bitch that's in the skirt
I'm passed the motherfucka out here paying his dues
Not the average nigga out here rapping claiming he true
I just stick to the script and take it in stride
Get my daily dose of game from James and take it and ride
Yes yes y'all, funky fresh and in the flesh y'all
This time I'm aiming at the neck dog
It ain't no ducking when I'm bustin', I'm a leave you a nice-
Little whole in ya throat, releavin' ya life
I'm going out with a bang, letting my nuts hang
I'm outty like flame, the signature just James, recognize
[chorus]
So what you gone do Face? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (I'm a play the game 'til I win)
So what you gone do? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do Face? (Play till I win)
So what you gone do? (Double back and do it again)
So what you gone do Face? (Play the game 'til I win)
So what you gone do? (Then I'm a double back and do it again)

Sweat tears and blood, paid dues alive
In these streets I roam, I've been blessed to live
Could've easily got caught up in my yesteryears
But I'm here~! My story remains the same
I ain't changed a bit, I speak words of pain
From a frozen heart, lost what's left to lose
I'm alone and what I promise is death to you
And it's true my only fear is I have none
My conscience makes me keep me to myself cause I blast one
And I can fall asleep right next to a dead man
I'm cold, I put bullet holes all off in your headband
So, bring me death cause I've been itchin to see
if it's an afterlife, aim it at me, cock it and squeeze
Please... back to back to back to back to back to back, nigga
From my first fuckin album nigga
And I still can't be fucked with, trust me
I'm the truth in here, I give up what's real
Not afraid to die, not afraid to kill
But afraid to lie, and too scared to steal
Cause what's mine is mine, and what's his is his
In these streets it's clear, punishment's severe
If that line is crossed that's when them guys appear
It's like nothin you've seen, so fuck what you've heard
It ain't what you believe, cause it's deeper than words
If that silence is broke then somebody's comin to blow
holes in yo' upper body, leavin a bloody coat
to be viewed by these dues who feel like this
When it's enough said it's bloodshed, believe that shit nigga
Cause we that sick nigga, you see that bitch - get her!
Cause he that snitch nigga, so squeeze that's it figure
that you watch what you say, you say it and die
What you cherish is close to me so don't testify
Straight up hood nigga, made it rappin
Yeah, caught a break huh
My life put down in words homey
That's some real shit, yo
A rapper - you hated to love, respected and feared
what I'm capable of there's nothin they say in our ears
I'm a soldier for fortune, I've got murderous plots
Plus I'm suicidal, walkin this parking lot
With my dangerous thoughts, I'm a dangerous dude
When I up it and cock the hammer I'm aimin dude
I came in to do, I'm a killing machine
And with life comes a price so I triple the fee
When it's trippin with me, either you win or you lose
In the end he who wins is he who finishes fools
I'm sentencin you, to a home in the sea
With the lint in your pockets, you rolled with weed
Exposin the weak, you hoes fin' to sleep
with the fishes bitches and y'all should know the demeanor
Yeah, everything that I say I am nigga I am
Know the rest of you motherfuckers wish you could be that real
I tell you what my nigga, be real with your motherfuckin self
I am Facemob nigga~! I am the best nigga
I am the back to back to back to back nigga
Y'knahmsayin? Yeah

Turn up your radios
[Scarface]
You're down and out, money funny, you hustle and die
On the verge of pawnin your jewelry and sellin your ride
Somebody shoulda told him ain't no life in these streets
You only out here 'til you touch it, when you touch it you eat
Niggaz done took too many chances shovelin snow
And ended up facin a lifetime for tryin to sco'
I'm givin livin definitions on the subject of dope
One week he back on his feet, the next he's WHOA
I was a 70's baby, raised in the 80's
I was barely touchin 16 when shit got crazy
I remember in the 80's, me and pop would ride
Now we conversate on acres we's about to buy
He had already been what I'm about to go through
Told me ain't no sense in gamblin if you gamble to lose
If you made twelve dollars, you put seven away
and lived off the five, and never ever fuck with ya safe
But when
[Chorus]
When he hustle and he robbin
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin
[Scarface]
I'm bout my paper, these other niggaz slang for the sport
Like unaware tommorrow ain't promised, the game is too short
I've witnessed niggaz get it all and give it away
Gettin back was out of the question, they lived for today
Then the hunger pains start up, then the murderous plots
to set up, they fuckin homeboy to get what he got
I mean the ones he broke the bread with, the ones you don't want
to be the ones fuckin your girlfriend the moment you out
I know the street game backwards, forwards, sideways
It used to be an honest hustle back then but nowadays
it's cutthroat, that's fucked up, niggaz want they come up
so bad they'll take the .357 and smoke they brother
A damn shame; but, that's the way the game go
A chance niggaz is takin especially if they slang dope
I've been in that position, back in the day
And feel my homey, hittin my head to crack in my safe
And that's when
[Chorus]
When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggaz start starvin
And when you niggaz start starvin
That's when you niggaz start robbin (when these niggaz start robbin)
When these niggaz got problems
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin
[Scarface]
So listen up my niggaz, and I ain't tryin to preach
I'm just tellin it from my side cause I'm in the streets
I done been there, done that, seen a whole neighborhood
destroyed by the government bein tipped off by one rat
He caught a dope case and they threatened him with time
He get his own fuckin people jammed and he take the five
That's the shit there; they ain't even catch him with dope
But they gave him thirty-five years cause the nigga done spoke
Snitchin, that's a motherfucker, watch what you say
You don't know no-motherfuckin-body, nigga you lame
Watch your so-called homeboys, keep to yourself
Stay away from niggaz gettin caught that get out of jail
Don't talk about your business, keep yo' thoughts in yo' head
And this game it got a paper trail, watch where ya spend
Don't write down names and numbers, it's a memory thang
Never shit where ya sleep, keep the crib out of range
And plus you never let these niggaz know where you stay
Cause when the push turns to a shove, they hit and you say..
.. true motherfuckin game.. true motherfuckin game
[Chorus]
When ya hustle ain't evolvin
That's when niggaz start starvin
And when you niggaz start starvin
That's when you niggaz start robbin
When these niggaz got problems
That's when niggaz start plottin
And when you niggaz start plottin
Us country niggaz start mobbin - mobbin

Flipping the script, from balling back to gansta rap classics
You know that shit that hit the hood and upset it
If real niggas respect it, the squares gon' rep it
I done came in here to bring it to you
The uncut version of ganstarism with the nickel painted Ruger
Quick to cock it on you, spark light in your eyes
The unexpected is happening to you now nigga, surprise!
Who is it? (Face, marchin', mobbin')
You said it one more time (Face Mob)
What else? (we keep you)
Now motherfuckers lay it down
The ruler's back, cause it's too many pussies out here
making bullshit records and ruining rap
I gotta check this whole game; niggas out here listening
to these record label bitches instead of doing they thing
I'm a real nigga, a street nigga till it's done with
And I could never let you talk me into dumb shit
Like selling out to move a few more units
Just keep me in the ghetto cause the hood stay truest
You fuck around and cross the other side of the track
Catch you a brick then realize that you can't come back
I'ma stick to the facts
Fuck it if I don't go two
The homies know that Face stay true
And though I've got more muscle, my sounds don't change
Been the same ever since I stepped in the game
Now, this is for these niggas switchin' they shit
Prostituting theyself, trying to get them a hit
Suck a dick
**Chorus**
You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
You a sellout nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
Fo sho I talk a lot of shit but you can bet that I'm the nigga
Out here backing it up, while you acting it up
I can prove you ain't as real as what you claiming to be
You the king on your block, but you ain't shit in DC
You ain't shit off in the city of Chi
You ain't shit off in the Do It or Die
They want to skin you alive
Out here talking like you carrying arms
We don't shoot at motherfuckers, we done flipped the script to carrying bombs
I can end it for niggas out here who's hard in the booth
Any city I can hit the hood cause Scar is the truth
I know so much about these streets that I can walk them asleep
You can't tell me shit about your hood, I walked on your beat
I know your whole life story, plus I've seen for myself
You got caught smoking dope, that's why they sent you to jail
Had you locked up with wet backs, only real niggas suffer set backs
90 days and I ain't goin' to respect that
And you can sniff a snitch a mile away
Fuck him in his ass and feed him dick, a pound a day
**Chorus(2x)**
You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga
I've got niggas I was raised with who know who I am
Lil' Brad from out of South Acres, prone for scams
Never ducked the motherfucker, I was down for the dirt
Got respect from older cats cause I was down for the work
When Fondren had its Great Skate I'd roll to the club
Drunk off the bird with thumbtack holes in my glove
Stood in the corner waiting for bullshit to jump
And in the event it jumped you saw a fool get stomped
There it is, can't get this shit no realer than that
Had a super boxing game, but now I'm peeling your cap
I done been in fist fights with niggas twice my size
Got an incredible record, 27 and 5
And the 5 losses I got, I had to redeem 'em
So he had to fight me everytime I seen him
Ain't no pussy in me, I've been for real before this rap shit
I study MCs, that's how I know you hoes is plastic
So-a, shake your ass and I'ma tell 'em the truth
Fabricate your bumps and bruises homey, do what you do
Just remember who for real when they tell you they real
I survived the game of life nigga, fuck some skills
**Chorus(2x)**
You a sellout nigga
Bow down nigga before they fuck around and find you face down in the river
Talk down nigga and I'ma bust you in your mouth nigga
Show 'em you a foul ass nigga

And my realities is the next nigga's nightmares
You know what I'm sayin?
Keepin it real

For life, nigga

Spent 75 on some cakes
Straight raw, 2.2 was each weight
And fuck the law, niggas on my beeper wanna get hooked up
The colas in the beaker with the soda gettin cooked up
It's all about makin g's, I'm the man
27 in the oz's, the bag weighs a gramm
Walk a tight rope cause the feds is watchin me
Cause I'm slingin mo' dope than a pharmacy
I got it on wholesale, takeover's the target
Straight snow sale, nigga, floodin the market
And I can give a fuck, nigga, if you wanna tussle
Jealous of my figures, you're best to check your hustle
We can get down if you run up
I'm from the Town where niggas get down from sun down to sun up
Gotta watch my back, niggas creepin in the strike zone
Always got my gat, they got me sleepin with my Nikes on
[ CHORUS: Seagram (2X) ]
Every day and night
Livin in the life
They got me sleepin in my Nikes
It's do or die against my rivals
I could give a fuck cause it's all about survival
[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
Fuck it, I'm high, mentally stuck, do or die
Who the fuck am I' A young killer on the rise
Look in my eyes, you see the vision of a nigga feelin trapped in his inner self
It's fuckin with my mental health
Born in the city where the niggas die young
Mist-covered street corners collapsed where I slung
And everybody standin stiff waitin on the cake
I'm waitin on a muthafuckin break, ain't no escape
Make no mistakes and leave a muthafucka breathin
They all got to die this evening, cause I believe in
You kill a muthafucka 'fore a nigga come through
With his crew makin your nightmares come true
Now who gon' be the first to die cause I'd extinguished your whole click
Gimme the money, nigga, no shit
I'm in your spot with a Glock, down to bomb
On any nigga needin bomb, sleep with your muthafuckin Nikes on
[ CHORUS: Seagram ]
[ VERSE 3: Seagram ]
Gots to watch these pirates tryin to get my treasure
I don't know why it's, but police pressure
Got me feelin like a zero, mayn, no good
But I'm knowin I'm a hero, mayn, in my hood
Now I'm havin dreams of firin at them lames
I used to have dreams of retirin from the game
Now as fast as I got it, I'ma lose it
See, the cash and narcotics made me ruthless
Timer know the real, they heard the situation
'bout the drama in the Ville, I'm 3rd generation
Now they wanna put a jacket on my risen hustle
Cause I couldn't hack it livin in the struggle
Now I live every minute like my last one
Labelled a menace and a threat, and I'ma blast em
Seldom I can smile when the lights is on
And if you're livin like me, you better sleep with your Nikes on
[ CHORUS: Seagram ]
Yeah, uknowmsayin
Keep your muthafuckin eyes focused, mayn
On this muthafuckin game out here
Uknowmsayin, cause it ain't no joke, mayn
Uknowmsayin, cause you never plan to fail
You fail the plan
You feel what I'm sayin?
So keep it real, mayn
And keep your eyes open for these busters
And these snake-ass niggas, uknowmsayin?

It's been a long time comin
But now I'm back up in this bitch to hit these niggas with this gangsta shit
I keep the strong rhymes runnin
My shit don't switch, I'm 10 years in, and ain't changed one bit
It's all about the real, nigga
I keeps it real, nigga
And won't sell out for Girbaud or Tommy Hilfiger
Fucker, I figure niggas wanna see
The side of society they don't see on TV
So when I bring the shit, I bring the shit like I seen it
And when I scream the shit, I sing the shit like I mean it
No secret, these muthafuckas figure I'm a threat
Cause I ain't fallin short to the traps the demon set
Now sweat, cause now I got my head in your books
And when I think 'cracker', my definition read 'crook'
Now look, we're livin under laws that they set
Back then we were treated like dogs and wasn't shit
And slowly but surely the shit changed
From they fault, but if you black, then you get blamed
A damn shame, that means this muthafucka's one-sided
And blacks, we get lost in the sauce because we unguided
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
Get what they can get and rip they assholes apart
They smart

I declare an all-out attack
Let's take our minds behind enemy lines, so we can see how the demon acts
And how he set us up for failure in the first place
And why the fuck did we just settle for a birthday
You see, I'm hip to the games that you run
Like the games you run unfair, we can get no fair one
Cause we was dealt the bad hand from the jump
And we can't deal, so we jack and get drunk
And might end up locked down or six feet
But in these streets a muthafucka gots to eat
You can't sleep, cause if you're caught sleep, you gots to pay
And just like everyone left you got your day
And these days were meant for all to keep tryin
But we can't relate, so we fall and keep dyin
Open your muthafuckin eyes who your enemy
The muthafuckas dyin or the muthafuckas killin you?
[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
You put your crack on my table
I turn my axe on my neighbor
And my back to my Savior
You had me thinkin you were almighty
But to the Almighty you're just a man that's really all tiny
The Maker will open up our minds to see
That Heaven ain't a place here on Earth, you gots to leave
And once we leave, we stand between eternal peace and eternal pain
And you the Beast shall meet eternal flame
So let it rain, wash away up all my bad things
And put some laughter in our hearts again
Now black men, stand up, let's come together as a whole race
And don't be fed up by the old days
They try to do us like the Indians, killin us like wild beast
And show more love for the Chinese
And kept us trapped up in a small room
And made decisions on our life we accepted that left us all doomed
They sabotaged and they camouflaged
But if these niggas came to crank up some shit, then I be down to ride
These muthafuckas had a plan from the start
The only way to beat em is to think, cause they smart

Verse One: 2Pac
Our lifestyles be close captioned
addicted to fatal attractions

No fairy tales for this young black male
Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales
Hustlin too hard to think of culture
Or the repercussions while bustin on backstabbin vultures
Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches
Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures
Why shed tears? Save your sympathy
My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetary
Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe
If you believe then you can achieve
Just look at me
Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on
Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on
To all the seeds that follow me
protect your essence
Born with less, but you still precious
Just smile for me now
Chours: Johnny P, 2Pac
Smiiiiiile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now)
Just smiiiile (smile), smile for me
(What cha lookin' all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now)
Smiiiiiile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about)
Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smiiiiile
(And the next generation)
Verse Two: Scarface
Now as I open up my story, put the blaze in your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly upon phrases I run
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin circles in my ninth grade, dealin cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile
Smile
Chorus (without 2pac)
Verse Three: 2Pac
Fuck the world, as we are loc'in witness furious speeds
Unanswered questions keep us all stressin, curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin, crooked thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
(Scarface talking)
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
may the angels help to lead the way
shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac
Smile
(Smile for me)
(All ya need to do is smile)
(Woooo smile for me)
(Come on smile for me)

**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
I wanna walk with you, follow in your footsteps
Talk with you to find out where my good's kept
I been gone away from home for so long
Seems like everything I try to do without you go wrong
I'm confused about a lot of things, but not with my fate
So I'm depending on your holy ghost to guide me the way
See I'm a sinner in the 3rd degree
Ain't afraid to admit it, scause I seen niggas worse than me
Who am I to judge a man when I'm a man myself
In the dark, trying to get me some help
I went from pawn to king, king back to pawn
Doing my best to try to ease out the storm
I know that every tunnel's got an end and a light
And I prepared a new beginning in Christ
My life is like a jigsaw dulling in time
And as I'm thumbing through this jigsaw puzzle of mine
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
It seems like every other Wednesday I'm attending a wake
But I don't question you, I know that's your way, ok
I know we living for the minute and there's a moment in time
We've got to leave here, cause that's your design
And nothing lasts forever, not even spirit, only your word
That's what I live by, 'cause that's what I heard
I wasn't there when you rose from the dead or parted the sea
I never seen you, but still I believe
How you explain the moon, the sky, the stars and the rain
The sun and the sea, the earth without form facing the deep
In darkness challenging the powers that be
It's impossible for scientists to make up the seas, to make up the trees
So why we turn our backs on the truth?
It's heaven or hell, the point we seem to hide from the youth
And I was singing this morning, got touched by the spirit
So I wrote it down for the homies to hear it
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
Lord I know that I've been wrong
They say a man is lost without a prayer, without a song
So I'm singing on my knees cause I believe you'll keep me strong
Until it's time for me to bring it home
But until it's time for me to bring it home
I'll be out in these streets, hanging in the hood
Even gangsters need to pray, cause when I pray it's understood
That I got flaws about myself, I can't make it by myself
I need the heaven's help, I want to follow in your foot steps
Done seen the strongest man bow down to a higher power
And given all his glory to god cause god towers
Over all, and in that I save this prayer
For all my homies that's been trapped out there
That's stuck in their ways, it's different now than back in the days
So fuck what they say, cause ain't no coming back from the grave
So when the gun goes pop and the lights go out
Then you'll understand what I'm talking about
**Chorus [Faith Evans]**
I know god is watching from above
Sometimes I wonder what I'd do without his love
And although life is full of adversities
I know he's with me, he's with me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
I know someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday...
Someday, someday, someday
He'll come to get me
**Outro(4x) [Faith Evans]**
I just want to be your solider
I just want to be your vessel, woooo lord

[Scarface]
I swear I feel so all alone, back down on my knees again
Hopin you can keep me strong, cuz I can't hardly sleep tonight
I took too many sleepin pills, I drunk too many Miller Lites
And I can feel the Reaper near, so please forgive me for my sins
I am just another man, sorry for the pain that I've caused
I know that you'll understand, these demons'll drive me - insane
I've been goin mad, rightly oughta blow out my brains
Cuz I'm hurtin bad but I'm fightin... blast, on the other day
These problems got me usin more drugs, along with the other things
I'm slowly fading into my thoughts, (come against me, bring it on!)
and I'm driftin in and outta space, and I don't believe I'm wakin up
with the alcohol, them drinks, drift me to another world
Where the sunshine stay shinin, I think I was finna url
Mom, can ya look at me? This ain't what I used to be
Tomorrow, I'll be somebody else, cuz I ain't been me
I can't seem to shake these, I'll put that there on every day
Boy tryna figure me out, is like Lamar changing
But my childhood was fucked up - raised rowdy by a single moms
She told me my daddy didn't give a fuck, she ain't let him do his job
Seventh grade; failing, and I don't know my next of kin
These days in these fucked up ways, who the fuck are them?
My daddy had three other kids, but I ain't never seen 'em
So, ain't no sense in coming around now, you ain't been here befo'
It's sad but I ain't feelin nuttin, my whole life's been a fuckin maze
and when I tried to locate my siblings, they were gone away
Lost inside they other things, fucked me then, fucked me now
Quick to tell me ""Show you some love"" nigga show you Hell
Ain't no love I'm feelin here, I ain't never felt this vile
Momma - did you really love me, or was I just a child?
Said it, outside, I knew you seen it in my face
I wasn't really happy here, but I was forced to lead the way
Copped me a Cheverolet, drift away to the other side just to think
If I get to see Heaven, I can thank you for the ride
and thank you for my other kids and even though
they mommas won't admit that they can't make it but bad,
low on the child support - always been bad boo, tryna make me out to be
the bad guy that I really ain't, bitch so quick to hassle me
Cuz I don't see my kids enough, but I make the time to pick 'em up
But you find somethin to stick in my face - it ain't me fuckin up
It's bad enough, face to face, always wanna catch a case
So bad, they'll try an get me they make me - and what takes the cake
Is the whole world is fuckin up, daddy know where the weankess at
and you spoke lies to ya old mans eyes, how could you sleep wit that?
Jepordize everything, just for searchin for larger life
Sacrificin the whole family, with no regards to Christ
Funny how people can take this shit for granted, right?
But then reality strikes, and changes things overnight
I thank the Lord for watchin over me, though I'm prone to doin wrong
I repent religiously, hopin that the weak get strong
when the heat get's on {*wind blowing*}
Hopin that the weak get strong, when the heat get's on
[talking - echo after each pause]
Ya know... the street's different... stays as it likes...
Either, headin into a storm... ya in a storm...
or ya just got out of a storm... (yeah) think about it...

Alright let's ride
(Verse One: Scarface)
I spit my day right off a holiday broke and disgusted
With out enough money to buy food but I'm smoking so fuck it
Hit the school yard I would hard because I am larger then life
Close smokey eyes shining cause I am high as a kite fuck it
High school teachers I am a man of respect
South acres baby gangstas the man of respect
Fuck the school vice principal he shieved I'm leaving
Told my momma about my dope case and my momma believed him
Now my daddy got a problem with my edu-cation
So shy where the fuck mine let him know what they facin
Got the doctors who studied this but niggaz would doubt it
Probably take shrink at night time then you out of it (trust me)
I see the same thing flash change violent
And mother fuckers caught in that chain remain silent
So why you figure I've be standing here shaking
Because the devils is close to taking me but I can't face him (oooooh)
My soul is controlled by the blessings of god
Still scared to walk the first ground because the devil is in charge
Somebody help the lord soul find saviour
Cause I'm standing on the corner with a tech nine for the hole behaviour
They want to take me out the game like rider
But you youngstas better stop and peep game because my game wider
I send this out to thoose who thought that they cook
Cold as fuck when it came to the game and my game done
Southside south south side, south side south south side
south side south south side
South side south south side you know what I am saying

Nigga you spit the wrong shit you gettin' spurred in the mouth

Introduce 'em to the glock 1-9, beat 'em up
Who in the muthafuckin' house y'all, the Gulf Coast

Lookin' for sumtin' to happen
And thinkin' that these streets are cool

Hoe, there's no southern hospitality
'Cuz when dey get here
Then the southern fatality

Wit a group of niggas when it's time to do a job
Fuck these groupie bitches smokin' drankin' with the squad
Because it gets crazy after dark
They keep they hands on they gun
From 5th ward to South Park

Money to fold, afterparties and shows

This a wake up
[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
Ain't nothing like the Sunnyside sunshine (sunshine)
Hitting corners ducking one-time
In my platinum color four dog
Tinted out roll rolls (yea I roll, roll)
I hit the beach and I say tops down
Girls with they tops down (whistle)
They got bikinis and they thongs on
Dancing to the thong song (thong song)
[ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ]
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
I see that lately that my loves on
Stop at Papa Joes and get my grub on
I ran into my old fling Tasha
Still looking cute but she was knocked up (knocked up)
I'm like ay how you been girl
I see you finna have a kid girl
The funny thing about Tasha (what's that)
Is that she was destined to be knocked up (knocked up)
She twenty-nine and still a cold freak
But she got a baby in the car seat
She wanted to be seen in all the funk spots
Still getting crunk staying drunk huh (drunk huh)
The Friday nights are still the same things
Looking for diamonds and the chrome things (bling, bling)
I'm sitting in my Benz in a nice spot
I bet you want to be my wife huh

But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you

And I been lonely for a long time
That's why I'm glad the baby ain't mine
Ran up to the door but left my car keys
I went back in the store and I saw Daffany
Lookin like she did back in eighth grade (eighth grade)
Just like she did back in eighth grade
We used to skip school and do the wild thang
And I'm like daffany was up man
I just got out law school
She said attorney for the criminals
I'm making six figures every six months
She said she had everything a bitch want
And been lookin for a nigga for her whole life (whole life)
Don't you want to make me your wife? (Uh, uh)
I guess my answer must have stunned her
(I don't think so)
I guess I must have stunned her
[ CHORUS: Tanya Herron ]
Bye, bye baby
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you
Can I spend the night with you
You been to blocks and drinking brews
You been hanging out with your crew
But I'm rolling the spotty for you

waken by the sound of my cell phone,
Donny hathaway singing on the ringtone.
Was a homie that I went to school with,
tellin me life wasnt shit to fool with.
These young niggas steady dyin' over dumb shit,
fast money for your soul,
now your done with.
You hear the gun click.
Blood stains on the walls and carpet,
pain and the hardships
of a father identifyin' his child
from a photo of the plan,
with his brains blown out now.
Lets rewind to where it all took place,
started off in math class early that day.
Hey! Its high school,
and everybodys tryin to earn a rep
and he gone gun shot a homie to death.
The impossible is happenin,
children are left to make decisions.
Do ya let 'em die or kill them urself?

As I look at my life..
Remembering where ive been.
I may not have been here.
Cuda been in the gutter,
drowning in my tears.
I remember how hard it is on the block. (Yeahhhh)
Everytime you turn around somebody got shot..
Oooooh,
but im still here.
Im still here.
Another homie got murdered in the dope house,
ass pocket full of money,
chillin' gettin' smoked out.
Two shots hit him in his face when he blast it,
frame pictured,
and its closed casket.
This is so tragic.
I see death on every block I turn,
its just not my turn.
Live the same lifestyle,
cash money to burn.
Weed blowin' steady slippin' in the darkest term.
When it feels like real life,
knowin' is next.
Rep to take it,
be the last left,
humble yourself.
In slow-mo you see your wholse life flashin'
that second from the beginning,
back to the end and that lesson
is nothin short of what a nigga expect.
Livin' life like this,
this is duly respect.
And I refuse to give debt.

Im still here.
Yeah I remember,
we tatted are names on our arms for fun.
Writin rest in piece for the dead and gone.
Thats just me,
and I aint the one to stunt,
but seems like im losing somebody every other month.
Thats why I walk through the hood
tryin' talk to the hood,
but some niggas is lost in the hood.
and we blind to that fact,
that we actin' like they wanted us to act.
White man versus black.
Reason I aint vote for my iraqs 'cos I love 'em.
They gonna want him hanged after that.
In god we trust,
what? (what?)
Money or the life of a soldier
sent to die in the war in a fight,
that never should took place.

Dancin' on the video, lookin' like Arsenio

Then I bust they ass in the chops like Roy Jones
Once again it's on, it's a must I keep it poppin'
Right hand followed by hook and ya can't stop it
I use rappers like spark plugs
Give em' a chance to get they hands out
Then pick they ass up off the canvas
Man what, if you ain't in the game then don't play it
Ain't tryin' to get ya ass knocked out then don't say shit

He's pretty good, and uh I beat the shit outta of him the one day man

Was like come to the front, man why you going up there

And the dude I had punched was shooting pool right, ha ha ha

And I started whipping him like that

Ain't no lackin' y'all thought we was slackin' shit, Face packin'

And moving slowly in silence, steady making sho' my hustle
Is air tight, these city streets is hectic gotta get it here
Tomorrow ain't a promise to me, so I don't live in fear
I work until I touch it, stack it until I need it
I spend it on what I want, re-up and that's when I bleed it

You can get your days cut short, under them street lights
Them folks got me under the scope, cause I ain't living right
Still I ain't the one to provoke, dog you get it right
20 inch shoes when I cruise, under them city lights
Careful with the road I choose, cause you can lose your life

Shot from a glock, that's smoking from not scoping
When a nigga told me, you don't work you don't eat
So I'm slanging thangs for cheap, where the streets lights meet
And my pop, was a rolling stone
15 I was grown, 16 I was holding my own
Is it wrong to sell you a dream, or sell you a zone
A long way from home, on this road I roam
Still I'm po'ing the liquor, for niggaz who ain't with us
Ery'body ain't a gangsta, every nigga ain't a killa
Naw but them laws, couldn't tell ya the difference
So pay attention, or find yourself locked in prison this ain't living man
Years have passed, and shit in the hood getting drastic
Two days ago, my homegirl got blasted
That's tragic, happened right on my block
I'm feeling paranoid, laws might run in my spot
So I'm living low key, and them folks don't know me
Slowly I ride through the city, stack mo' cheese
Then I slide out, to the hideout and smoke on
Haters watching, my chest is froze like a snow-cone
But hold on, trash talking ain't my game
Rather pimp me a dame, or switch lanes in a Range
Peep this it ain't a secret, them laws ain't right
They like to catch a late night, living the life
That's why I'm on top of my game, always thinking twice
Don't get it twisted, I still got a mean right
But most of the time, my nigga I'm on chill

[ VERSE 1: Scarface ]
I took my chances when I did my dirt
And my advice to any nigga if you crimin, you do it worse
Just get enough and step the fuck back
Cause in this game when you get fame
You gotta start dumpin these agents off your nutsack
I'm just a nigga out the hood tryin to have things
But when I got up on my feet you're screamin ""Brad changed!""
And your excuse was that the money came
But my excuse was that you missed the plane, simple and plain
I got to show my homies love, though
I just don't fuck around with niggas that I don't know
And you can take that how you wanna take it
I'm from these muthafuckin streets
And the same rules apply in this game, don't ever break it
Ain't my muthafuckin luck I'm all alone at the crack
And you niggas don't wanna try to attack
We steady dyin over dumb shit, and me, I'm steady losin my sleep
Cause niggas ain't familiar with the rules of the streets
You're stuck
Stuck at a standstill
On the beat one time, come on
It don't stop
Give it to em
...3
[ VERSE 2: Scarface ]
And to my niggas on the streets crimin (watch for haters)
Stop sittin on the sidelines and (get your paper)
Too many niggas complainin pointin fingers at the problems
""That's why I hate my baby mama""
I'm just a nigga from the very bottom
Skippin classes, goin 8 balls or the white powder
Tryin to get it while the muthafuckin gettin good
The possibilities of movin out my neighborhood
Don't get me wrong, I had them dreams too
But the only thing you do is get your cream, fool
Get your muthafuckin green, fool
Niggas ain't knowin 'bout the ins and the outs
First get in, then you get out
Don't be stuck at a standstill
(You know...
To the 2, ah 2-1
(...I was thinkin)
Rock the mob shit for niggas, come on y'all
(...need to, I don't know, maybe findin new hustles
like niggas is runnin out of hustles, you know?)
[ VERSE 3: Scarface ]
When it's over don't nobody cry
Just enjoy it while you live life cause everybody gotta die
So when you see me I'll be hella high
Bendin corners with my top down checkin out the changes in the sky
Shootin paper clips at Jupiter
The mo' I learn it's like I'm gettin stupider, and stupider
Tryin to make the best out of a fucked up decision
I'm just a nigga with a vision, which is
Gettin up, gettin out, gettin my profits
Tryin to stay away from these bitches that jock dick
Movin up to move on, gotta stay true to it
That's just the way you gotta do it
And these niggas here is renegades, don't give a fuck
But if you're real, then you like it rough, nigga what?
You know it, you know what I'm sayin is real
Now step the fuck off all those standstills
Cause you're stuck
Stuck at a standstill
Stuck
To the beat one time
Yeah
My nigga Mike Dean

Gotta keep my drawers up  shit's gettin hard now
These motherfuckin cops be plantin shit on these niggas
Simply because these niggas got bank accounts that's bigger
I just can't get no peace from you motherfuckin rollers
Everytime I pull my Benz or what  'cha pull me over
I'm sick of motherfuckers who be checking Whitey's coke tip
Blacker than a motherfucker, sweat me 'bout my *?dope-sip*?
Niggas just take your cut and get your ass up out my face
The only thing you probably get from me is a cock-sucking pistol case
Unless you plan on plantin a lil' somethin in my shit
Just because you ain't got shit, bitch!
Give em a badge and a trigger and that makes em figure
That they can fuck with a million dollar nigga
They got you mixed up, fixed up at the Segas, shookin Indo
Gettin fucked up in the gank-hole
The only way you'll whip that motherfucker is when you whip that
motherfucker
And we choke the motherfucker (Me stuck the motherfucker!)
So when you hear my song and wanna get it on
You better come prepared motherfucker, you dyin wit'cha boots on

Guard: Do you know how many years you're facing inside?
25 to life and that's on the real
So you better snitch on your partner
Inmate: Fuck that! It was Brad Dawg, I ain't goin out by myself
Niggas gettin caught, doin time, so they snitchin
They pickin niggas up on a funky ass suspicion
We'll be goin down for some questioning we think
And end up gettin hit with the fuckin kitchen sink
Racketeer and laundering, Kingpin wondering
If they got some unsolved murders, then give him some of them
Just because we're niggas and they figure we're no smarter
We sell each other albums, start frattin on our partners
They start bringin up shit that happened back in '85
And then comes the largest jury, bitch, they fuckin time!
You might as well play the state
Cos you come to day for day
And sellin out your homeboys ain't the shit
Cos y'all gonna have to die in this bitch, bitch!
Lobbin wit'cha white suits on
And dyin wit'cha motherfuckin boots on

out goes your brains; feel the motherfuckin terror
and you ain't felt the comin of death like this ever
you paused; and now I got a Colt 45
semiautomatic explodin between your eyes; surprise
you never thought your yesterdays would come back to haunt you
but believe me, I've come back to haunt you
I'm bout to bring your dog days to you mista

verse:
his mama must've got the news
the little boy that she gave birth to was on of them niggas they pulled
out the room
and all my other little homies stood shocked
while they watched my other little homie bleed non-stop
on the other side of sorrow is a father being torn
apart by the sight of his son's lying in the morgue
he mourned cuz now he got to deal with the fact
that his child is gone and tears can't bring him back
turn on the T.V. and seen the unabomber
I flew to D.C., still they got no karma
and everybody say they think its all gonna change
you paint me pictures, but they all look the same
its strange, I'm standin in my own frame of thought
remainin in the street game framin which I was taught
I was taught to always keep my eyes open wide
cause in these streets you got to ride or you die
I've seen a child born and I've seen a man die
can't live forever and I understand why
so when your time comes will you crawl or be brave
and in between judgement will you fall or be saved

verse 3:
tears rolled town his face as he stared at his potna
with his chest full of holes and his head full of coppa
broke his ass off something propa; he's in the morgue
with his brains in a shitbag and a toetag on-gone
this motherfucka must've thought he was a cat
and had nine lives but ended up on his back
and then the reaper came and took control of your mind
and you can't think you got a hole in your mind
you dyin' and can't nobody bring you out your coma
when this nigga brought the end and turned the lights out for ya
see ya and I wouldn't want to be in your position
cause starin' the shaft of a strap and you the mission
means one thing you let a mothafucka catch you on the sneak tip
and put your ass off in some deep shit; got the deep six
and everybody sad sendin' flowers to your ceremony
they lost thier motherfuckin' homey
damn Audi 5 on some dumb shit
and motherfuckers steady riskin their safety behind this dumb shit
but I refuse to give a nigga mine
I give a nigga nine

Come on, nigga..

The shit's fucked up now show a nigga where the war at
Cause I'm about to clean house
Stick this a.k. up your ass and blow that fucker clean out
Cause you niggas in the wrong
You came up short and now we fin to get it going on
I ain't your average motherfucker
You step out of line and watch a motherfucker bust ya
Cause you done came at me the wrong way
I ain't no Clint Eastwood, nigga, and you done picked the wrong day
So bring your ass to the battleground
Rat-a-tat-tat, like that is how my gat'll sound
Avoid no niggas cause niggas be human
I squeeze the trigger and niggas be moving
Cause I don't point it in the air and pull the trigger (why?)
I'd rather point it at your ass and watch the nigga die
I gives a fuck about your team mates
When it's all said and done you're gonna wish you never seen 'face
You shoulda seen that lil nigga Brad
James through here, seen Dave and, yo that nigga bad
And your homies better stand still
Don't make my brother Warren bust one of you bitches cause the man will
Don't bring your ass to my picnic
Cause I done had it up to here with all you niggas talking that bitch shit
So you better get your shit right
I'm from the state where you rarely see a motherfucking fist fight
It's all about the gun blast
So you can miss me with that bullshit you spitting with your punk ass
It's the diary of a born killer
Don't have to worry about me falling off this thang cause I'm a strong nigga
Doubt my regard of the hard
With niggas behind me from East Oakland to the South Park
I've got the mind of the man right behind ya
You can run, you can hide but I'll still find ya
Like I say there's no getaway
And I'm gon' have it where your family'll have to throw your shit away
It's the return of the real niggas
I'm prejudiced to a certain extent but still I kill niggas
I'll bust that ass on the fucking double
So push on with that ho shit, bitch, cause you don't want trouble
So get your ass up of my shoestrings
And let your shermed nigga do things
Ay, ay, ay where you fin to go, fool?
(I can't fuck with it, you got it, man)
Come on, man .. you wanna rap, nigga?
(I can't do it) Come on

of a dying breed
I don't remember much about bein born
But I do remember this: I was conceived on February 10th
Complications detected in my early months of ballin
Around my sonargram you could see the evil was swarmin
The hassle, was it what the world was seekin in a child?
The doctors wanted me out, my mama's in denial
Then I kicked her and gently rubbed my hands across her stomach
Told her: ""Keep em off me, mama, I'm comin, I'm comin""
Now I guess I musta been the reason mama couldn't sleep
Interrupted her peace, but it was time for me to eat
And since carryin me caused all that swimmin in your feet
Just know that I'm thankful, I'll let you feel it with my heartbeat
All the doctor visits and physicians movin me around
You could sense my discomfort in every other ultrasound
And I'm runnin out of room in here, steady slidin down
Then she opened up her legs and pushed me out (pushed me out)
(Nigger, nigger never die
Blackface, shining eye)
When I awoke I recall them walkin out my nose
Screamin at the top of my lungs, freezing cold
Wrapped me up in blankets after dressing me in clothes
Then I met the ?? that I owed
At 3 o'clock, what-what, nine seven o
Was the birth of a dying species, and this I know
The truth was in my bloodline, planted in my seed
The last of this muthafuckin breed

Stop bullshittin' and make another hit
I looked him in his eyes and told him that ain't shit
Gimme 30 minutes and i'mma wreck this bitch
So I wrote this rhyme i'mma bout to say
To tell him how it went down back in the day
See most niggas give they props to Run DMC
But dem' niggas in the south gotta give it to me
You see I was wrecking shit when they was doin' the worm
Parachute pants coming through with the perm
I ain't never been a pussy I was all day rough

Y'all muthafuckas don't deserve that name
And let me break it down to you one more time
Think about it before you start out your rhyme
I'm one of the coldest M.C. to ever touch the mic
So I apply the pressure til' I bust the pipe
And niggas always ask why I keep changing my style (why)
Cause i keep hearing muthafuckas claiming my style
And then they got the nerves to say they colder than me
Then why the fuck you niggas can't go gold before me
I see you on your videos on B.E.T.
It makes me wanna kick a hole in my T.V.
Cause i hate an individual who is fake as that
I gotta dropped Bentley with a Ranch to match
Nigga I finish with my shoot, my shit it can't go back
You back in yo' chevette ?????????

I'm knowin' you ain't mean it when you told me you was tired of life
and just wanted to leave it you were drinkin,
so I ain't really pay it no attention,
took you back to your crib and dropped you off
with the intention of gettin with this Asian chick
I've been met off in Visionz, something exquisite,
I had to spit that game cuz she was vicious,
I'm hopping back on 6-10 punching the drop
On my way out to her house I started noticing cops,
Something telling me to turn around and follow these dudes,
Normally I wouldn't consider but out of the blue I'm bustin a U
I get off where they get off at
Well-familiar with these streets, this where I came up at
Roadblocks, yellow tape, ""a crime scene"" they say,
What the f**k just happened? I just left this place...
I get out and started walking asking Frog, ""What's up?""
Looking at me dazed like, ""Face, it's all f**ked up...""
I move a little closer trying to see who it is
and I saw his baby mama in tears holding his kids...
Chorus
And it was then it finally hit me
I'm standing here nervous as I can be
It was nothing that can prepare me for what i'm finna see
I'm praying this is a dream and i'm bout to awake
But the closer I got the more I realize fate
Wasn't fair to change for me
And why would I think so
My homie had a date with death
He had to make though
I'm feelin eerie, I'm liftin up the yellow tape
By the time I get to the scene
they rollin this away
I wonder whats under this sheet, my knees get weak
To the point i had to take me a seat
This shits deep
When they put a nigga down that you was raised around
What was once a minor statement's turnin' major now
Never woulda thought in years that my homie was suicidal
Had it all money and kids and a wife that read the bible
They say its life and death in a tounge
He had his reasons I should have believed him
Another soul no longer breathing
Hate to say it but this one here been heavy on my conscience
My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense
Chorus
And everybody thinkin' its murder, but homicide saying self-inflicted
By the way the body was sitting, brains in the kitchen
Who coulda predicted
But the detectives who was fishin'
Fucked up that the family had to see dad in his position
All I remember was us doin what we did
To survive in these streets where we lived
We was kids growin up in this environment
Nothing but trouble
You either struggled or you hustled
Folded the bubble
Grade school til we dropped out, we had a plan
We was either finna be rich or die like a man
We did it all for the love of the hood, every journey
Imagine seein' your dawg lifeless across a gurney
I wonder what was goin on
You shoulda said that you was feelin' mad
I coulda talked you outta that
But never will i see you again
Nor will your kids
Nor will your family or your friends
Its the end
Not even words I write in this song
Can right that wrong
My nigga is gone and life goes on

so please, help me break these motherfucking...
(pause)
these motherfucking walls
verse two:
I scream, there's no one there to hear me cry
I guess its hard to scream to motherfuckers when you scream inside
I see my future and its coming in in plain view
I blame myself, but mommy dear I blame you
cause the world was fucked from the first
and havin' me only made the matters worse
now look at what they did to me
that's some fucked up shit for a kid to see
motherfuckin' dealin' after dealin', killin' after killin'
I'm tryin' to check a million
the world's going straight to fuckin satan
a fucking shank's about to blow my fuckin' brain
verse three:
shit, damn I'm dead
I'm finally through hearing all these voices in my head
somebody finally got me
I'm looking at my self outside of my fucking body
so now I'm standing face to face
Mr. Scarface, versus Mr. Scarface
we were two different people from the start
one nigga's too smart the other too fucking hard
we both refused to be outsmarted
dearly departed, the battle's already started
fuck it, its on, I duck, I weave, connect, oh shit, I'm struck
caugt me with the peircing lead
and realized to myself I shot my own fucking self
damn, suicide is quicker
I try to break the wall the wall keeps getting thicker
I really start to miss my mother
I try to climb the wall, its higher than a motherfucker
I wondering what that sound is
I'm having major trouble trying to walk around it
there ain't no getting up I'm trapped
I really should've dropped my motherfucking strap
cause when I think about it now
I shouldn't have tried to climb the motherfucker
(pause)
I should've broke the motherfucker down

Verse 1:
Rat tat tat tat to your ass is the mutha fucking flow

I fucks a vision like a sand shower
you going up against a stacked deck nigga, now where your man power
bring your mutha fucking backup
and blow the bugle when I step off this bitch and load this gat up
coz still a nigga's friend will bust you
dead in your head from the front and knock the back up off that mutha
fucker
now listen to the gunshot
I got that ass with that double barrel one shot
now I don't hear your heart beating
now I don't see your boy breathing, rat tat tat tat.
Chorus x4

Wassup boy?/ah, ah, wassup Face 1?/where that nigga at?/ah, he back

Verse 2:
I see your mama in the waiting room standing crying
I see your ass in the doctors arms slowly dying
now talk that shit that you was talking to your homie
bitch you should have shot me when you pulled your fucking pistol on me
so now I'm forced to pop the clip in
S to the mutha fucking A, nigga set tripping

To mix and mingle with this millionaire status
and send a mutha fucker to hell when he fuck with Brad-it's
the killer instinct that never left me
the southside still true to the game little lefty is back

So how can one try to see the unseen
Before you step your ass to the square know one thing
It's closed curtain we leavin' mutha fuckers hurtin'
It's Rap-a-Lot Mafia life we all workin'
Punk we shut you down before you get it started
You can hate it but I'm goin' get mines and that's regardless- bitch

Jealous of the game I obtain and I chose

I know I shouldn't do this
But I can't help it
I'm a fiend
Lotion and magazines is what I'm left wit
I step witout my pride
To the toilet
And laced my palm wit honey and almond
But suddenly the phone rings
And it's K.B.
Pussy just came through
Some for him and some for me
Hell yeah, I'll be there to help you fuck 'em
Get 'em drunk, get 'em high
Pull they titties out and suck 'em
[K.B.]
Don't rush 'em
We 'bout to fuck these hoes, man, no question
Just bring yo' ass on
Because they already buzzin'
And lovin'
My hospitality, I put it down
I got a quarter pound o' weed
And a big thing o' Crown
Shit, my dick hard now
Just lookin' at these bitches
Wit these big soft asses and these nice round titties
While you gigglin'
You best to hurry yo' as the fuck up
I'm 'bout one second away
>From crackin' this fuckface up
[Chorus]
No need for rest haven these hoes
Let's show 'em what they pussy made fo'
Let's me and you lay in these hoes
And show 'em what they pussy made fo'
No need for us savin' theses hoes
Let's show 'em what they pussy made fo'
Let's leave without payin' these hoes
And show 'em what they pussy made fo'
[Devin]
Man, just let 'em know I'm comin' in 'bout 25 minutes
And get they pussy ready 'cuz I'm finna dive in it
I hear 'em talkin' loud in the background, hollerin'
Tell 'em don't get too drunk and keep they pussy lips smilin'
[K.B.]
These hoes wildin'
But still I got 'em under control
Impatiently, waitin' for some dick that's swole
They just some horny ass bitches that love to fuck
Tellin' me how they suck dick and swallow the nut
(They gobble it up?)
I thought I told ya 'bout one of these hoes
That put my foot inside her pussy
Then took it out and sucked my toes
Yo, don't forget to stop and get some fuckin' Dunk 'ems
(What?) Condoms, you forget dem nigga we got a problem
[Devin}
That ain't no problem, man
You know we must cover our bones
Zoom zoom bust in the room
Get 'bout two and I'm gone
And as soon as I get there
I'm gonna spit some game to her
Get the pussy so quick
You think I already knew her
We 'bout to fuck these hoes
[Chorus]
[K.B.]
Finally, at last, Devin showed up
And the first thing this muthafucka said was
[Devin]
What the fuck is this thick neck big bitch here
Man I shoulda bought a 16 ounce beer
Say big hoss you fucked over me dog
I thought we was cool
How in the hell we gonna get
These two big bitches in the pool
[K.B.]
(Ha ha ha) You fool
Stop trippin' and just take ya clothes off
'Cuz all pussy feel the same when the lights go off
[Devin]
Man that's too much ??
For just one fuck
And I'll pass
You can't even tell the difference
'Tween they stomach and they ass
Stretch marks on they titties like a road map
Hoe slapped on some Maybeline
[K.B.]
But she keep her navel clean
And at least these hoes big and cute
Not big and fucked up
You den fucked a skinny, ugly ass hoe
So nigga what's up
Who give a fuck if you fuck these broads
Nobody knows
So just drank and smoke this dank
And let's fuck these hoes

Show 'em what they pussy made for (2X)

Watch ya step... watch ya step...
Watch ya step... you better watch ya step...
[Verse 1]
And ya don't stop, so I guess it's on once again
The Natural Born Killaz in a zone again
I'm different type of special men not known to man
I refuse to loose, I was born to win
A street nigga, the stand up type, never to fall
I've been programmed to run in and get it, take it all
Sit back and capitalize off mistakes you made
Beat yo ass into submission, and make you pay
I got battlescars from fuckin with this, I gotta have it
What's my reason for quotin this shit? I gotta have it
Like the Roy Jones - you see this money get me hungry like a wolf
And when a nigga hungry I'm a wolf
That's when I start my rage, and attack from the neck up
Catch you being careless, make these hoes respect us
Survival here, that's the name of the game
It's the jungle in this bitch and ain't a damn thing changed
Watch ya step

Let's get it on y'all, to the beat y'all
Fuck a bitch y'all, I'm from the streets dawg
So what it is huh? What it look like?
I'm a G fool, you the bitch type
You got yo strap dawg, I got a strap too
I'm from the Southside, we act a damn fool
You ain't the real hoe, youse a real hoe
I keeps it real hoe, for real though
[Verse 2]
Listen close to the story I'm about to tell
Niggaz is sellin they soul for an ounce of yell'
And a few leave, but this is a house of jail
Twenty-five year bids, without the bail
I know some niggaz in the tank, stuck, lost and thowed
Still boss turnin ya status from false to hope
Only a few niggaz stand up strong and don't whine
When the time get passed around huh?
I'm tellin you dawg, that even if you gettin released
How the fuck is you gon' live on these streets?
You got that jacket on ya back
You a rat and you done spilled ya guts
You a bitch and now you live to fuck
And you a nigga I ain't even gotsta feel to touch
I got some niggaz on the inside to stick and seal you up
It's all good for you out here, gettin yo mail
But the minute you get popped you gonna snitch in jail
Watch ya step
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
They say that music is a therapy to ease the mind
But see therapy to me, is to squeeze a nine
Right between ya eyes, while I squeeze ya throat
Chuck you off the side of my boat and watch you float
The animal they sent here to seal ya fate
Tie ya hands behind ya back and feel ya face
Ain't no hope for ya partner Joe, he broke the rules
In the jungle if ya weak, we gotta smoke ya fool
Ain't no love for motherfuckers who done crossed the line
Cocked dice don't pay nigga, now roll ya five
You wanna play the gun game with me, then pull ya shit
I know you'd love to try to punk me if you could ya bitch
But I'm a diehard nigga, I was sworn to silence
and if I got to go, then I (?)
So fuck you, and them niggaz that you run with fool
I'll do the same shit to them, that I did to you

You read my license plate, mad motherfucker
So you know the driver is a bad motherfucker
Swerved on the A-Town, exit off the {?}
Plus my homey from the hood done relocated uphill

I THANK THE LORD FOR EVERY MORNING HE ALLOWS ME TO RISE
AND THOUGH THE SUN IS SHINING THERE'S A CLOUD IN THE SKY
LETTING ME KNOW THAT AT ANY MOMENT THERE COULD BE RAIN
AND AS BEAUTIFUL AS LIFE IS THERE STILL COULD BE PAIN
DOWN THE BLOCK I HEAR THE SIRENS JUST-A SCREAMING AWAY
AND THEN THE INEVITABLE HAPPENS THE ENDING OF DAYS
SAD AS IT SOUNDS, THAT'S THE PRICE WE'VE ALL GOT TO PAY
AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNOWS THE LORD GIVE IT AND TAKE IT AWAY
I LIVE AND I LEARN, I SIT AND WATCH MY CIGARETTE BURN
DOWN TO THE ASH, REMINDS ME OF THE NOW AND THE PAST
I SAVE ME A PRAYER 'CAUSE EVENTUALLY I'LL STAND IN THE PATH
OF THE SOULS ON THE DARK ROADS THAT LEADS TO THE MAN

IN THE ARMS OF HIS MOTHER AS HE LOOKS IN HER EYES
HE TAKES HIS FIRST BREATH AND HE SCREAMS (THE BABY'S ALIVE)
AND AT THE SAME TIME ANOTHER MOTHER MURDERS HER KIDS
AND THE UNBEARABLE THOUGHT OF THIS HERE JUST BRINGS ME TO TEARS
IT'S HARD ENOUGH WE GOT TO RAISE OUR KIDS TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD
SO FULL OF HATE WITH NO FATE, AND YOU'RE KILLING YOUR PEARLS
AND SOMETIMES I GOT TO SIT IT DOWN AND WONDER MYSELF
BUT THEN AGAIN I AIN'T JESUS, AND I COULDN'T HELP
BUT ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE I NEVER LIVE WITH THE FACT
THAT I HURT ONE OF MY SEEDS, CAUSE DEALING WITH THAT
WOULD BE THE HARDEST THING I'D EVER HAVE TO DO IN MY TIME
I'D HAVE TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE TOO AND I COULDN'T CLIMB
THAT STAIRWAY THAT YOU HEAR ME SING ABOUT IN MY RHYME
AND A PARENT HURTING HIS KID AIN'T A SIGN OF THE TIME
I KNOW THERE'S TRUTH IN THAT STATEMENT WE JUST LIVING TO DIE
BUT I BELIEVE IF YOU LIVE IT RIGHT, YOU'LL LIVE IN THE SKY
LOOKING DOWN ON THE GOOD AND THE BAD, THE WORLD AS A WHOLE,
NOW HOPEFULLY YOU DID WHAT YOU DID ?FORE YOU HAD TO GO

I SEE THE BEAST WHEN THE DEAD DIE, RELIEF WHEN MY HEAD'S HIGH

THE TURN OF THE TABLE, THE TALE OF THE TAPE
THE DESTRUCTION OF HUMAN FLESH OF THE NOT SO GREAT
THE LONG LIST OF THE JOHN DOE'S THAT ACCOMPANY THE SPIRIT

You just a peon, the type of bitch I'd pee on
High sidin a nigga, rollin in a Neon, now what the fuck was she on?
I'm ""Prime Time"" bitch like Deion (yeah)
I Spinks on a ho like Leon
And you are just a castaway, so get your ass away
Instead of fuckin you, I'd masturbate
I shouldn't of had to wait, I think you blew your big chance
You rejected when I asked about the eighth grade dance
Now I'm big time, like my homeboy Randy
Plus I'm pushin a Porsche with drop top panties
It's just like candy but I ain't hammy
Yo ho, so yo, ass can't hand me
Shit, fuck your cell phone bitch, you can keep that
Broke, you ain't know a motherfucker, where was she at?

That's so long ago and since then we both have grown
But look at you, you're amazin
What's so, crazy, I know how niggaz do
'Cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are
Listen, in high school with the females, I was rarely selected
I got rejected by the ones the damn nerds rejected
If I wore a shirt Monday, this is true, I ain't lyin
By the end of the week you probably saw it two more times
I was discouraged by the microscopic size of my bank
But stayed constantly motivated to rise in the ranks
I used to be a bottom feeder, lowest man on the totem
But I showed a mass like the transit sit on my scrotum
Gettin fed by my music and it's all clean work
And the used to be prom queen is a Walgreens clerk
I would dream about bein with ya, wantin to kiss on ya
Now I let my damn bladder bust before I piss on ya
Me and 'face second to none, makin records for fun
You thirty-seven at the strip club gettin naked for ones
But I ain't trippin, you can hit the room with me, it's fine
And when I bust one on her chin, I'm like ""clean up on aisle nine!""
(yeah)

Thugga, huh
A (Bitch Ain't) never been (Shit) to me
I've been screamin that since ""Chronic"" popped back in '93
Back when I was broke in the hood on my ass
I couldn't get away when the bitch drove past
Now a nigga seein cash so fast, things change
Same bitch askin for a ride in the Range
Lookin at a nigga strange, 'cause I ain't tryin to entertain
Conversation about her becomin my main
I'm like ""bitch, you must of fell and bump your brain
And think you fuckin with a lame, nope not me mayne
I ain't got shit for ya, matter fact, I don't know ya
That's all I'm a show ya, 'cause that's all a nigga owe ya
Used to be fine, big titties and behind
Had a few kids, now your belly bigger than mine
Stomach lookin like you had a fight with a lion
I ain't fuckin with you bitch, move around""

'Cause they get money, change and don't remember who they are (they are, they are ...)

This past year was a rough ride, joking aside
A lot of niggas left to do bids, and most done died
My neighborhood is like a ghost town
Would hype some trash
The BGs got the hood hot
With whites and rats
The old folks is mad at us cuz they kids is lost
How you expect for us to teach when all you did was talk
The trickledown theory but this generation of thugs
Aint nothing like my niggas was when was hustling blood
It went from weed to cocaine
Cocaine to drank
Drank to handlebar, heron, x and crank
Smokin dip, plottin homicies, killin theyself
Butt naked waving pistols round the feeling of death
Got mama crying, cuz she know deep down they needin her help
But he's a dead man walking, still she pray for his health
Why did Cory have to die young
I'm losing my friends
Fought the war against Cancer
But he lost in the end
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Outside I see the cop cars flashin they lights
Raindrops symbolizing God is saving the life
The sun shining so they say the devil beatin his wife
The body bloody underneath the sheet is waitin for Christ
The streets is hungry so I know they watchin
Waitin to strike
But anything you ever got for easy
Came with a price
Its just the chance a niggga took
He was shaking the dice
Committed suicide to get his chain covered in ice
I aint gon lie I did the same thing
I wanted to shine
25 and had a drop Rolls
Top of the line
I came a long way from rockin up
Ounces or dimes
To moving big boys
4 or 5 blocks at a time
And since this rap it wasnt paying bills
I did what I did
Got my money for it
Let these niggas see how I live
Wrong answer
You'd think a motherfucker be proud
To see his homie on his feet instead of talking him down
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Now if the ghetto ever made a change
It changed for the worse
But I love it so I write in tears
And pray til it hurts
Prick my fingers
Til the blood stains would cover the page
Wipe my eyes and look ahead
And hope to see better days
I turn my TV off
Cuz I don't wanna look at the news
Hard times seeing people crying
Arabs and Jews
Fighting for they religion
Niggas livin like niggas
Mexicans on the border
White boys saying kill em
Politicians playing puppet
Gotta answer me this
Do you believe you really God?
My answer is this
Did you say
Let there be light, give Adam his wife?
Produce the vegetation
Separate the day from the night?
Create the land and the sea and man in your own image
If not, then I want all this bullshit ended
Sending the kids to fight a war that they ain't have to be in
That Saddam shit is dead, let's see you fuck with them Koreans
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?

Win...Lose...Draw...Die
Scarface:
I read the book of Revalations
and now I realize we in revalations
and on that note I make this statement
For all the young guns to become one to die young
because the world is filled with hatred
and they aim to blame our sons
and I done seen down the barrel of a strap before
but I don't wanna die no mo', I fear the reaper
help us Jesus, help to keep us away from all the sadness
and deliver us from the hate that cause the madness
I'm glad its installed in me from day one
Believe in something because most of my homies believe in nothing
and paying for it, God bless your souls, I'll be praying for it
eventually you'll have your day in court
and I done been a witness to homocide
seen a whole family die
before the stones of diamonds in the sky
through my bloodshot eyes feel the hurt and all the hate
that I've trapped inside because the hurtin' hard to ache
there's a smile on my face
but, that's to keep a man from crying
cause deep down inside, I know I'm dying
I'm born for it, gon' take some time to getting used to
and Satan I know that your listening but I rebuke you
and refuse to let you capture me and kill my will
just to survive the game of life, win or lose
do or die, refuse to let you capture me to kill my will
to survive the game of life, win or lose, do or die
Chorus (Johnny P):
(2X)
Whether we win or lose this life to do or die
but sometimes we lose the will to win and wonder why
DMG:
Open my hands like a book
years and years me and my notebook
I take a close look
Peep it dread see myself failing
a felon on the verge of 1-8-7
but I ain't ever wanna do it
'cause homocide never solved it,
just momentarily resolved it
we've all been involved in the calling of a loved one
oldest ones the young ones the smartest one the dum-dums
and not begun with some
and they all probably died with none by the gun
that's on the one, two, three and the fo's for life
I slap five on the black hand side
I realize the future lies among my two sons and daughter
so I pray to God just for tomorrow
In lieu of the drama I move my momma
but the poverty's prolonging the pain
plugging my arteries and veins with strains
when I lose in this game
Chorus
Lo-Ke:
12/11/73, a young little huster was born
torn from my momma's womb in the midst of the storm
never warned I was going through a world of stress
never knew that I was born for death, may God bless
My pops died when I was thirteen, I'm still tripping
forget living, I'm on a suicidal mission
tears dripping from my eyes as I look up at the sky
asked the higher power why my old man had to die
It was hard to say goodbye I tried to hide what I feel
forget the wife forget the will (naw, chill; naw, chill)
I'm at your gravesight, latenight trying to figure out
would I see your smiling face if I commence to dig you out
I'm all about the cheese, I plan to see you once again
but I can't make through the night without commiting a sin
I had to realize there wasn't no friends, backstabbin
I had to watch my own back while I was out mashin'
closed caption for the hearing impaired
have you ever seen your closest homey laid out buried and dead?
I shed a tear even though I'm not supposed to cry
I can't lie I ain't ready to die, I ain't ready

And now you got your eyes on my vault tryin' to take my paper
The vapors will leave niggas wit dreams to face satan

Hatin' and I don't cause the conversation
He spoke wit his killer but now he's got to face him
Racin cause off in these streets you aint promised tomorrow

Stretch you aint never seen drama like I can bring it

Y'all know me
Still the same ol' G
But I've been low key
Hated on by most these {niggas} with no cheese
No deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me cuz I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office in the back of my house like trophies
But y'all think I'ma let my dog freeze
Ho please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C.'s and Snoop D.O. Double G's
And the group that said ""Motha Fuck"" tha police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bumb when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wadn't doin to good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin no sleep
So fuck y'all
All uh y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around with me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips

And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre (x2)

So what do you say to somebody you hate?
Or anyone tryin' to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?
Just study your tape of N.W.A.
One day I was walking by with a walkman on
When I caught a guy giving me an awkward eye
'Til I strangled him off in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryin ta park a Dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage

With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches

Starting today, and tomorrows the new

Hotter than a set of twin babies

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me

Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 Nigga (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that shit, huh Dre?
[Dr. Dre]
Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was  The Chronic  (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
[Snoop - singing]
If you ain't up on thangs
[Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (ha ha)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still
Chorus:
[Snoop Dogg]
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   (Repeat 2x)
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's  Turn Out the Lights  from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E
Chorus
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   (Repeat 2x)
It ain't nothing but mo hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play dis track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
[Snoop - singing]
So if you ain't up on thangs
[Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E  (x3)
[Snoop]
Right back up in ya motherfucking ass
'95 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!

I got mo' class than most of em, ran wit the best of em
Forgave the less of em, and blazed at the rest of em
What can I say?  Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately
and the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.
started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin, pistol holdin
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder, for real
I'm hittin switches, makin bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos
1 -	Niggaz play this in they Rovers Jeeps and Regals
2 -	Bitches play this in they Benzes Jeeps and Geos
{repeat 2X}
[Hitman]
I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin hoes at movies
Passin by with uzis - and who you aimin at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin that
Rat-ta-tat-tat {*automatic gunfire and screaming*}
{*more screaming as tires peel out*}
I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
tryin to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
like snitch niggaz in the pen that get
hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit crews
that's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me wit no other by the flow motherfucker
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal
Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos

[Dr. Dre]
Niggers that I used to know and sell dope wit'
Listen to how a motherfucker flow shit,
And let me know what's up and they can blast on,
Thinkin' about the homeys that passed on.
Death Row come to show you all the game at,
And show you how my label got the name that
So many wanna see me, and time is money,
But never in the P-E-N, yo.
Welcome back to Viet Nam, California.
Ain't a damn thing changed, so let me warn you.
Every motherfuckin minute you on the West Side,
The best side, 20 niggers that just died.
Walkin' down the streets of L.A.
Stay strapped cause niggas bust caps every day, yo
The 1-8-7 don't stop, on undercover cops,
So on this spot gettin' popped, shot,
Droppin' like this and like that,
Rat-tat-tat-tat with their caps peelin' back.
So creep when you in the C-P-T.
You catch heat from fuckin' with' the D-R-E.
I got my eyes on the shit unfolding.
And there ain't gonna be no trippin'
Cause they know the type of shit that I be holding.
If there's another word said,
I'll let my forty-fo' go buck to the head, nigga.
Yeah, and you don't stop,

Yeah, and you don't stop,
cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin cop
[Snoop Dogg]
3 and to the 2 and 2 and to the 1,
Head away, sent away, get away Snoop's got a gun,
And he's lookin' for the cops who set him up in '86
Now it's time to put they ass in the mix.
Back on the streets with my khakis and my scars,
Nuts full of cavi and I'm headed for the bar.
Scared as a motherfucker, cause I'm fresh out,
But I got to make my green, and plus they all fiend
Follow me, they keep yellin' murder, but it won't stop,
Until the last nigga that you know drop.
Another nigga out, but I doubt that you really give a fuck what it's about.
Now, 99 pigs on a block with me,
Not a motherfuckin' cop wanna knock with me,
A C-O-N-V-I-C-T, the motherfuckin' D-O-G, comin' from the L-B-C.
Look at what the doc brought in,
A chrome 38, a Fo'ty-fo' mag, and mack 10
So what you wanna do?  (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a uzi and the mothafuckin 22
so if you wanna blast, nigga we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em then we stuck 'em so fuck 'em!""
Yeah, and you don't stop,
cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin cop
Yeah, and you don't stop,
cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin cop
Splat to a motherfucker face, he fall.
Strong motherfucker cause he starts to crawl.
I guess I gots to load the glock again.
Hit 'im with the hollow points and watch him spin.
Fuck it, I had to do this quick.
Grabbed the glock 17, the clip went click.
Tried to detect, but did not detect perfect
So I creep on that ass, pops him and drops him.
That ought to stop from beatin' up blacks,
Dead in his tracks, from a full six pack.
Relax, cause I'm about to take my respect.
I aimed the twelve gauge straight for his neck.
Boo-yaa! Boo-yaa! then I fade into the wind.
1-8-7 and it's on again.
Well it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on,
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome
And it's on, and it's on, and it's on, and it's on,
Fo'-fo' Desert Eagle to your motherfuckin' dome.
Fuck 'em, buck 'em, if they really wanna trip,
Niggas keep your hands on your motherfuckin' shit.
Yeah, and you don't stop,
cause it's 1-8-7 on a motherfuckin cop
Yeah, and you don't stop,

It's fuckin ackrite
Question is - can I get some?  Knahmsayin?
Ackrite bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just ackrite, youknahmsayin?
When I yank you by the fuckin perm
don't be lookin at a nigga crazy
Just get with the digits and be the fuck out, youknahmsayin?
Let me break it down for y'all
It was just one of those days
when I wanted to catch sunrays
Fun to get blunted on a Sunday, afternoon
Nigga ? got room, grab the gat for misbehavors
and the chocolate faded boom, flossin hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clownin whores
Around the full good-to-go girls
like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in The Ra
Sippin 151 that gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'ma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'ma have to ack-wild
Chorus: sung by Hittman
Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggaz don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight?  And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa haters don't like
Snatchin up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight?  So give a nig' some ackrite, right)
[Hittman]
Uhhhhh.. drink kickin in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words, I'M FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool til some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
gettin swarmed by those type of niggaz
with no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
Yo, is this your man?    No.
Grab the bitch's hand,  I'm Hittman.
Bling! Gold chain gleam
You're very eligible for my summer league team.
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethern
I got mad spit flame on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Hoe you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
witcho' lips swoll, and give a nig' some ackrite
Chorus (minus the word  Aight  both times)
[Hittman]
Frontin on the ack-rite, causin me to act up
Good Samaritan save that hoe from gettin slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
from fake macks {*CAR HORN*} aiyyo, chase them girls
in that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
neckbone, lookin back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the hush, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tip-in
Mackin interrupted by some niggaz set-trippin
Clip in the strap, I showed these niggaz how to act
Chorus
beotch
i just wanna put my dick on your shoulder
so you can put it on your mind later on
(??) take that dick off your shoulder   put it in your mouth
drink the evidence   hide the dick behind your head
the police is comin, ho ten
put this dick behind your head

Intro/Chorus:
As the world keeps turning, chronic keeps burning
(This ain't no) street sermon, these niggas are determined
*Repeat*
Verse 1:Where
I flow like CD's in the deck
Moosh fools in the face that lack respect
Protect ya arm, pitch from the funk
I deodirise the musty, ya rhymes are crusty, you can't bust G
So leave me alone I'm in the zone
Walkin the streets on my own, nigga get blown
Some niggas say that nigga Where is gone
But I'm low in the cut and gotta microphone
Are you gone bust or play bones?
You motherfuckin clone, get off that nigga's style and get'cha own
It's Miscellane and it's on again
For the niggas that slept, they shoulda stayed in step
And kept ya big fuckin mouth shut
Chorus
Verse 2:Where
I woke up with a stomach ache, headache, back ache
Advil, Tylenol, Peptol, slept so long realised my world is wrong
My world is gone like disco
Blowin up Cisco and in my Cammo
Standin in back of me was my soul
Thinking of the easiest way to get a bank roll
Knowledge is urban-able, exhaust manifold
A tar can of hos to lubricate my system quick
Shaky bitches off the dick
Cos she got a vice grip on the flow from my lips
I'm slow but equipped with the proper tools
Show me the one talkin shit so I can drop a fool
I'm out to glow a nigga roll if he think he Mr CREAM
Come back on the scene and smoke a phillie, G
I really dream of gettin mine now let me tell you what's silly
Me, buckin with my team is murder one
I heard a gun bustin shots (SHOTS!), down the block (BLOCK!)
I guess a nigga gettin what he got (GOT!)
Shit is heavy like a medicine ball and broke niggas to smoke niggas
I'll fuck one for y'all, they made ya last phone call
To a trick that didn't even care
Cos she was gettin fucked somewhere, you're stuck in there
Now you wanna bust, nigga, now you wanna kill, nigga (Nigga)
Nigga how ya feel? (Nigga)
You can't try to be real (You can't try to be real)
Shit is for real
Chorus
Verse 3:Where
I'm cooler than most, but I got the shorter temper
And I'm cooler than foes that don't know how it goes
Let's take it back to the first side
When you was a new jack and jockin my new track
But you was wrong, didn't know about the big long
Head-strong, nicknamed Dav from off the school yard
Witta teenage group I'm turnin loots to tracks
Me and my niggas like (These tracks are laced with bomb weed and tight
lyrics)
You wanna know what the hos used to do
When me and my crew came bustin through
All sorts of blushins brew
(A neighbourhood find, a gift too swift, Miscellane is the crew)
Underground till my brown eyed balls turned blue
This is for the bitches and niggas that wanna front
I smoke on, I broke on till I spoke on
Miscellane packin shows like Farrakhan
Where is on another level with two niggas that's on the same plateau
Now that's three times your tightest flow
And three times ya tightest track, three times your fattest sack
Three times is clever (BUCK!)
Chorus x 2
Outro:
Thou shalt rest in grief who lay buried in the belt
Barely included work, leaves bodies scarred and hurt
To art in hell, where the next man dwells
The place with stankin pussy and crack rock dwells

Here's a penny for your thoughts
A nicklebag of bliss
An M-16 with eighteen clips
I'm all set to bust, treacherous
Illustrious, homie don't question us
Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question, nigga
How many niggaz can I blast on sight?
[Verse One: Kurupt]
I'm ferocious, and you knows this nigga
Bitches wear skirts, shake ass and bump
I pop pistols, that's all I do
I pop one at him and pop two at you
I'm illusive, I'ma glock it
Pistol popping activist with the key to the bucket
I rip your pockets of the side of your pants
You glare to the side and you glance, I'm in my G-Boy stance
How the fuck you make it this far?
No matter where you at, or who you are
People treat me like Kareem Abdul Jabbar
I hear ooh's and aah's when I jumps in my car
Just from last night you can tell
that I'm addicted to the fast life
Shouts out to my homeboys Mad and Quell
You go on and fuck Misty, while I fuck Michelle

What you wanna do, penetrate me?
Bump my crib? Bust and fuck my bitch, nigga?
I never thought a nigga would trip
off a little piece of ass that he know he could get
Any day (any day) and any time (any time)
You'se a vegetarian (what?), I like beef, turkey and pork
Fish and chips, chips and dip
Fuck it, hand me my knife and my fork
I'm not too picky nigga, Kurupt young Gotti
A.K.A. Low Ricky nigga (what up momma?)
Substantialar, tyrannosaurus, gigantic titanic tarantula.
On a creep homie, wake up
Don't sleep homie, supposed to know it
Look, I'm hazardous to health, nigga, bitch, nigga
Don't ask me shit 'till you ask yourself

What the fuck is up? Man life's a bitch
You gotta put your pistol to the sky,
kill a million motherfuckers and get high in order to be cool
Man, you'se a motherfucking fool (speak to these niggaz)
I thought the same way, back in the days
Young, with a lack on daily things
Never thought too much, homie, never trip
I got drunk as fuck, the homies blaze sticks
Look out for them niggaz out to catch us
So I'ma stay forgetting to tank your pistol with you (your pistol nigga)
Niggaz get swallowed in the game
I cock and bust hollows to peer, duck and frame
Yo nigga, that shit sounds like I did it
Don't blaze the ??? without the top bullet
Niggaz look like they're doped up like tired bitches
With the eyes wide gone you spit the hard boom
Wiping shit the fuck out like typhoons
With the little homeboys, T-bone and cartoons
Motherfucker don't ask me for shit
Fuck everything you believe in, little bitch

Just ask yourself the question
How many hoes can I fuck in one night?
Just ask yourself the question

Ha ha, riiiiide..
[Dr. Dre]
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
[Eminem]
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
Chorus: {unknown singer}
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
[Dr. Dre] + (Eminem)
He was ""Shady,"" I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
(Eminem)
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin]
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
[Dr. Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a ""G Thang,""
and a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin""
I said ""It's Dre's Day,"" and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way
(Eminem)
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
Chorus 2X
Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide..

Put your cups up, get your smoke in
Baby, we partyin, ain't nobody loc'n
Who you provokin, what you want now?
Take a look around, it's pimp shit goin down
It's a lot of bitches, a whole lot of freaks
Top notch hoes, they flock in every week
What you wan' do, get your next thrill
Take an X pill, how the sex feel?
Damn you lookin good, all ten of y'all
Wwanna roll (yeaaah!), I'm dickin y'all
Keep your face down (ooh), keep your ass up (ohhh)
You know what your doin (ooooh), keep that shit movin (yeah)
Keep them titties jumpin, keep the Henny comin
Every bitch in here need to be touchin somethin
I know they like it hot, that's why I keep it hot
So how the fuck could they not want a piece of Doc?
[Chorus: Knoc-turn'al]
I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm just drinkin, smokin, straight west-coastin
Bitches puttin ass in motion, pussy poppin, sex promotin
Got a car? [Raise it up]
Got a blunt? [Blaze it up]
That's your bitch? [On these nuts]
Really I don't...[Give a fuck]
All I really know your hoe wants to be with me and she ain't playin
And what I'm sayin (she creams with me)
And screams between the sheets
Soon as the door close
I make 'em curl toes, they all wanna get chose
We never love y'all, my niggas all macks
We sip a lot of Yak, fuck and never call back
Pack women in the club until it's pitch black
Thugs on their block wonderin where their bitch at
Where you think nigga? She with the Aftermath
Called her house, she ain't home, she with Aftermath
No talkin, fuck how your day go
You want dick (yeeeaah!), will bitch say so
Don't be shy now, probably the best at it
They say a party ain't a party until the west at it
Gravitate to the Doc like it's automatic
Take your clothes off, make me wanna grab it
Turn around with it, make me wanna stab it (yeaah)
Time to get it crackin, show me them bad habits (oooh)
[Chorus]
When she's all alone she sneaks out to be with me
And what I'm sayin is she ain't playin (she creams with me)
And sleeps between the sheets
Yeah, Aftermath, Doc Dre, 5-star surgeon general (yeaaah!)
Nocturnal, L.A. Confidential (yeaaah!)
What up Infinite, Mohagony droppin the instrumental (yeaaah!)
Do the math, Aftermath gets the last laugh (yeaaah!)

Late nights is full of led that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and every light
put you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Bustin on shit to lay everything down even tourists and non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Know the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggaz are dumpin
You'll be shakin your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Makin death not so foreign to ya
Niggaz got Rugers and M-14's with enough,
ammo to leave an armored truck swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leavin
Ain't no, warm welcomings, my eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Niggaz doin brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand, in front of your buildin and chill
without yieldin, twelve-year-old children that kill
blood spillin, thugs be illin, unnecessary slugs
fillin the sky, usually drillin the one
that wasn't willin to die, yes sir in the Killing Field
I got my, life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder, these niggaz got the nerve to
question me - bout the colors that I got on?
Now see that red dot on your knot
Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune, I'm the wrong nigga to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on

Done that - done that
You got guns - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...
No question, it's all about the D - O - E.
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree.
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati,
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C.
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea.
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3.
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide.
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo.
It's how I ride - cartel style.
Full, stacked to the max now.
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how.
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay,
with more chips than Frito Lay.
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly.
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...

Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella.
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller.
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split.
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'.
Ladies, get your paper too.
Don't expect for no man to support you.
Keep it true,
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos.
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads.
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing.
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions.
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat,
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat.
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get.
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet.
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...
[Chorus] x 2
This is for the millionaires,
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin',
Honeys start to stare.
'Cause game is money and money is game,
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame.
Now many people die over these dead green guys.
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise.
It's the root of all evil and sins.
Yet and still it makes the world go around,
Like my 20-inch rims...
Moolah y'all.
Platinum plaques cover my walls.
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw.
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce.
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
I been there...
And done that...
Been there, done that...

Forgave the less of em, and blazed at the rest of em

Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately
and the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.
started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin, pistol holdin
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder, for real
I'm hittin switches, makin bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases
Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal

You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
tryin to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
like snitch niggaz in the pen that get
hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Times is changin  young niggaz is agin
Becomin O.G.'s in the game and changin
to make way for these new names and faces but
the strangest things can happen from rappin
when  niggaz get wrapped up in image and actin
Niggaz get capped up and wrapped in plastic
and zipped up in bags when it happens  that's it
I've seen em come  I've watched em go
Watched em rise, witnessed it and watched them blow
Watched em all blossom and watched em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money? I lost them both
Went and visisted niggaz in the hospital
and saw the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (the watcher)

Niggaz aim angry at niggaz they can't be
But niggaz can't hit niggaz they can't see

How would you feel if niggaz wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
and choose a new spot if niggaz wanted you shot
I ain't a thug - how much Tupac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch neither - it's either my life
or yo' life and I ain't leavin - I like breathin
Cause nigga we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit fo'pound for pound

Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
Cause everytime you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous, to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangsters
Hustlers and youngsters livin amongst us
Lookin at us, now callin us bustaz
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tight than a mutharfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the muthafuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number 1 song after number 1 song
Long as my muthafuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or 2
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing cuz the shit she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she's takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough up to no good

So I head down the street to long beach
Just so i could meet, a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes
But i'm from the pound and we don't love them hoes

I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be up in them guts like everyday
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a muthafucka lickin' the protung
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figure niggaz wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one time
I'm back to the muthafuckin' county jail
6 months on my chest, now it's time to bail
I get's released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homey Dr. Dre
Scooped in a coupe, Snoop we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some muthafuckin chin checkin
Move up the block as we groove down the block

[Verse One: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
the state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes
ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way

Shake it shake it baby

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
the life of a west side playa where cowards die
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrands
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!

But still I know
That my love is so strong for you

Should I love you?
Should I leave you?
So many choices

So many reasons why
For me to have you near me

What to do when it comes to me & you
Because my love is true

A little hazy but mellow
When I feel your eyes on me
Feelin fine
Sublime
When that smile of yours creeps into my mind
Oh oh

Nobody said you'd be so beautiful
Nobody warned me about your smile
You're the light, you're the light, when I close my eyes

When you spend nights out with your friends and not me instead
Feelin black
When I think about all of the things that I feel, I lack
Feelin jaded
When it's not gone right
All the colours have faded
Then I feel your eyes on me

Tonight's the night I get in some shit, (Yeah)
Deep cover on the incognito tip.
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to,
Peelin' caps too, cause you niggas know I'm comin' at you.
I guess thats part of the game,
But I feel for the nigger who thinks he just gonna come and chance things
With the swiftness, so get it right, with the quickness,
And let me handle my business, yo.
I'm on a mission and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigger maxin at the top.
I hope you get his ass before he drops.
Kingpin kickin back while his workers sling his rocks.
Coming up like a fat rat.
Big money, big cars, big body guards on his back.
So it's difficult to get him.
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with
him.
Hit him like this and like that,
Let 'em know that I'll make it for a big fat dope sack
What is this pen? so let's rush it.
If you want to handle it tonight we'll discuss it
On the nigga's time, in the nigga's place,
Take a strap just in case one of his boys recognise my face.
Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker,
But I gives a fuck, cause I'm going deep cover.

And see what we can find
Crooked ass cops that be gettin niggaz a gang of times
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at 7:00, so whassup nigger?
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)

Six fo' five was the time on the clock,
When me and my homey bailed in the parking lot.
The scene looked strange and it felt like a set up
Better not be, cause if it is, they're getting lit up.
Oh here they come from the back and they laxed.
I'm checkin for the gats they strap, so whats up black?
Chill, lets hit a deal,
if it aint up to what you feel then grab your steel.
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip.
Cause you can save that shit. Guess what they told me?
'We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homey,
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush,
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us.""
Hmmm, let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat and guess what I told him before I shot
it:
'If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah, I'm lettin' my gat pop'

And everyday my love
You got me missing you

Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
Whattyou think this is KRS-One from the Bronx kid!
East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 8X)
Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constituional rights have been suspended
Verse Three: B-Real
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast trippin goin on through out the business
East Coast West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'ma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
from Central to Westland Avenue, without my glock
But some niggaz can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killin in the highrise
office, analyzing the song
Look at them red niggaz, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggaz bringin the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill
Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!
East coast *killer*, West coast *killer (repeat 8X)
Verse Four: Nas
Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, are mergin at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real
to make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal
like Heavy Heel, but what's the fuckin deal
East coast *killer* West coast *killer* (repeat 16X)

Aww they say uhh..
.. a black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
on planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma
It's her MOMMA that told her,
Get a man that got a good job gurl!
Make sure he got a good car gurl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!
What happened to just fallin in love with a nigga with a bus pass --
-- just cause you love the nigga?
But +I'm+ the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player!
Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..
.. are walkin through the motherfuckin neighborhood
You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
but you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
you went and got pregant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
cause that nigga ain't shit.
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth
that yo' momma, you was a hoe!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a hoe, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out
that's why he ain't here - but he a good nigga
cause he take care of his REAL family
I was just a dumb bitch, tryin to keep, a nigga that I wanted

Ya'll know me still the same ol' G
But I been low key
Hated on by most these nigga's
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family wit groceries
Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin up in the office and back of my house like trophies
Did ya'll think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho Please
You better bow down on both knees
Who'd ya think taught you to smoke trees
Who'd ya think brought you the O D's
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's, the Snoop D O double G's
And the group that said muthafuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To pump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin too good
Who's the doctor they told you to go see
Ya'll better listen up closely
All you nigga's that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flopped
Ya'll are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck ya'll, all of ya'll
If ya'll don't like me blow me
Ya'll are gonna keep fuckin' around wit me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin comes out when they move they lips

And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre
[Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anybody tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way (Yup)
Just study a tape of NWA.
One day I was walkin by
With a walkman on
When I caught a guy gimme an awkward eye
So I strangled him off in the parkin lot wit his Karl Kani (choking noises)
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin out wit two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'mma kill you and them loud ass muthafuckin barkin dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
From here on out it's the Chronic 2
Startin today, and tomorrows the new
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death wit a Charleston Chew
Chica Chica Chica
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's ok go with him Hailie (Da Da?)

If it was up to me
You muthafuckas stop comin up to me
Wit your hands out lookin up to me
Like you want somethin free
When my last CD was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little Company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all
All them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all
Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of Aftermath
Ain't gonna be nothin after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddlin' a cabbage patch

I love you so much
I think about you I feel you in my arms
I miss you.. I miss you terribly
I've just always wanted someone like you in my life
I love you so much; that I'd do anything
I'd do anything
I'll be your perfect woman for you
[Dr. Dre]
I just wanna fuck bad bitches
All them nights I never had bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
Mad at 'cha boyfriend, aint 'cha?
You'se a bad girl, gotta spank ya
Gotta thank ya for that head clinic
Explicit, hella photogenic
And tell your friends where the dick's at
Where they can get hit and won't get back to they soulmate
Before you kiss 'em use Colgate
She Swallowed It!   Yeah the bitch took the whole eight
and ran with it, then let Mel-Man hit it
and Hit the Man hit it; damn bitches
Man, this is what I'm talkin about
Chicken-head, chicken-fed, with a dick in your mouth
Out and about with your nigga like it never took place
(Airtouched) Next time you need a taste
Chorus:
I just wanna fuuuuuck you
No touchin and rubbin gul, you got a husband who
loves.. you..
Don't need you all in mine
I just wanna fuuuuuck you
We can't be kissin and huggin gul, you got a husband who
loves.. you..
You need to give him your quality time
[Devin the Dude]
You got the number, it's on you to make the call
You know I cum quick; help you re-decorate your walls
Cut your backyard, don't have to act hard to get the cock
And if I'm goin too far, I take it out and wipe it off
and put it back up, and keep going
You tryin to hide it from your husband but I know he be knowin
that your pussy's been tampered with
Then you show him the new trick of how you can lick it, smoke a cancer stick
You be workin it like a dancer bitch, it's hard on me
Not to give you all of my time, that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed
I'd rather spend my mornin diggin through some records instead
But, tonight, I guess it'd be aight if we can touch bases
Hookup somewhere and exchange some  Fuck Faces
I know your man's lookin for ya, he's always tryin to run ya
Don't worry bout me handcuffin gul cause I just wanna fuck witchu
[Snoop Dogg]
.. fuck witchu
On the sneak tip, on some creep shit
So whatcha gon' do, ya freak bitch?
You, actin, like you, don't, do, dicks
That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin wit
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennesey, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the flo', so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' 1/2 Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home, and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Man, she blowin up my pager, the shit's gettin major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin to go by, and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth, and then I'm out (see-ya!)
Twenty-fo' seven, Dre, Snoop, and Devin
We servin' these hoes, and never lovin these hoes, beotch!

Get in where you fit in, and never get your ghetto pass revoked

[announcer]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old.
Fed up with life and the way things are going,
he decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
(""Shit is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this"")
[Dr. Dre]
Alright, stop!  (Huh?)
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence  (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfucken conscience
[Eminem]
That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with Rene's razor blades
[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns
[Eminem]
Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
[Dr. Dre]
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!  (You're right!)
Not over this shit  (Stop!) Drop the biscuit  (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre?  I don't like your attitude..)
{sound of static}
(""It's alright c'mon, just come in here for a minute"")
(""Mmm, I don't know!"")
(""Look baby.."")
(""Damn!"")
(""Yo, it's gonna be alright, right?"")
(""Well OK.."")

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old.  (""Give me a kiss!"")
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play...  (""Shit!"")
[Eminem]
Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe..
(Yo!  This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair?  (Uh huh!)
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie _Kids_?)
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail..

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.
(""WHAT THE FUCK?!?!"")
(""Grady!!"")
[Dr. Dre]
Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..
[Eminem]
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
FUCK slittin her throat, CUT THIS BITCH'S HEAD OFF!!!
[Dr. Dre]
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What?  She tripped?  Fell?  Landed on his dick?!)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
[Eminem]
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!
[Dr. Dre]
What'chu say?  (What's wrong?   Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherfucker!
[Eminem]
Uhhh-aahh!  Temper temper!
Mr. Dre?  Mr. N.W.A.?
Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw fuck it...

Some niggaz bang blood, some niggaz bang crip
And bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
I had to dream of hoes, I had to scream at hoes
I seen my hoes in all kinds of clothes
Lil' Almond Joy, I truly enjoy
if you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot
From the way she was blowin, I know she does it a lot
I have a eight-and-a-half, nine-and-three-quarters

Check Check, 1,2 ,
1,2 1,2 (it's rolling)
Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here
Y'all know what this is.
its what y'all been waiting
for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother
fuckers what time it is baby
[ Eminem ]
I used to be a lonely man,
only mad, until I got
a million dollars, shit
Now if i only had some fucking
hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
out of Tupac's chest before
the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again,
it was an accident
I had my back against the fan
and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it
aint latching, and can't lock it
so they stapled my hand
to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered
like someone else had it
before me, and just kept throwing
they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching,
I'm dedicated to medication
but this med is taking to long
to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?)
The first man who taught me
how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the
street screaming, ""Fuck the Police"" (1)
when you still had your
mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(fucking baby)
Became a role model after Colorado (2)
Now all they do is follow me
around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch
and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck
a man in his face but I won't
cause you'll probably
wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it,
with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough,
you just get drunk and become talkative
(Wanna Fight?) I'm probably
the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with
a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on
your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit
like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs,
when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady
[ Dr Dre ]
Dr Dre!
[ Eminem ]
I'm drunk pass the tec
[ Chorus x 2 - Eminem + Dr Dre ]
Cause if I get locked up tonite!
Then I might not come home tonite!
[ Dr Dre ]
Keep it moving! Off and on,
Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On
[ Eminem ]
The whole entire world can sit
and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire
with a curling iron (AHH!)
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Dont get so bent out of shape
cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it,
but I won't let it upset me
cause they don't know better
They don't know what
the fuck its like to be so fed up
and fed so many uppers
you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own,
sometimes I can't find it at home
it hides in the stove
(Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the
oven on 480 De-Grades
Hailey Jade,
daddy loves you baby,
Don't ever tell me how to raise
my daughter fuck you lady
You critics wanna criticize
but couldnt visualize
individuals lives through
a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that
I grew up in you could die for nothing
and Dirty Dozen watches over me
so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped
with a band-aid over his mouth
and shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what
I can and what I can't say
or change cause of the
age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck
who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it,
I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now,
it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus
clowns up in the circuit now
But now the white kids like it,
so they tell me I can buy it
but as soon as I get on the
mic it's like the night get silent
either that or booed,
thats why I keep an attitude
and go to sleep with it
and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged,
fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder
I committed since 3 years old
[ Chorus - Eminem + Dr Dre ]
Cause if I get locked up tonite!
Then I might not come home tonite!
[ Outro - Dr Dre ]
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do

Yeah, whattup, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin on
Thank God it's Friday
""Buck buck buck buck booyaka shan!"" - KRS One"" [repeat 4X]
[Chorus:]
Keep their headz ringin (ding ding dong ring-gading ding ding dong)
[repeat 2X]
[Verse One:]
(Hey you, sittin over there) Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair) That's right
(And work your body down) Yeahhh...
(No time to funk around, cause we gon....)
Funk, you, right on up
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck so call me Blackula
As I drain a niggaz jugular vein
and maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin it real, enables me to make another meal
Still, niggaz run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggaz off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes panties wet
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin
[Chorus]
[Verse Two:]
One-two for the crew, three-fo' for the dough
Five for the hoe, six-seven-eight for Death Row
Mad niggaz about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I fin' to, get into to, my mental
will take care of this business I need to attend to, cuz my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right I'm gonna kick it, or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin niggaz over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I kick plenty of ass, so call me an astronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggaz know, it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokesscreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin
[Chorus]
[Verse Three:]
Debonairre with flair, I scare wear and tear
without a care, runnin shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop N Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop N Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1, 225, a pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin me are slim G
Cause I rock from summer til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherfuckin D-R-E, will keep their motherfuckin headz ringin

L.A.W. (Lyrical Assault Weapon)
[Intro:]
It's like, it's like this
Word up, knowhutI'msayin? One time for your mind, y'knowI'msayin?
Yo, from upstate to Brooklyn, the whole borough's thorough
You know the time, y'knowI'msayin?
Crown Heights, to all my niggas holdin it down
It's hardcore, B-boy rhymes just for you, y'knowI'msayin?
(L-A-W, this might trouble you) This is Sharief, y'knowI'msayin?
Puttin it down for the Aftermath like this
[Verse One: Sharief]
As I inhale the blunt and take a sip off the yac
My rhymes come to life, my verbal forces attack
Can't hold me back, I'm too strong, I waited too long
Freestyle a whole rap tape then write a new song
Been in the game since...what? That shit is past tense
Pass the microphone and watch this nigga crack the C
with that ill shit, I came to kill shit
I crack the code, must be the reason they reveal shit
But in this era of mayhem
I recyc' the murderous rhymes to slay them
To all my opponents who wanna kick it, I spark
the verbal scientist in your title, I'm walkin wit it
A hundred dime pieces and the party got the heaters
I shine my verbal styles and got niggas climbin on speakers, the thrill
seekers
An earthquake of bass lines swangin the party, I'm slangin the mic
like a syllable shotty, sippin 40's
[Chorus:]
Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the B-boys and all the B-gals
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the B-boys and all the B-gals
[Verse Two: Sharief]
Bona fide B-boy, biceps' bionic
Blast em back, okay let's get it started
Original rap styles comin from my shooter
Fifty niggas deep, I'm the ill kid recruiter
People gather round, check my flow
listen too, look take a peek, time for thought then you know
(What they know?)
I build with skill, fulfill the drill and still then kill
You couldn't stop the pain with Benadryl
Too many claim unnamed for fame
or be soft as baby tissue with no gun to aim
I take a raptor's rough cuz I'lla date the semen
Spectators be sayin they can't go where he went
That's another level of attack (haa), bring your bats
My DJ scratch the record like a scrotum sack
I slice the rapper like a surgeon
If he wanna battle, I play him out like a priest in a turban
Too much tenacity, vocal capacity
Ya better take some notes, don't try to get on after me
Cuz I'm the chemical enemical
Rhymes I say are definitely guaranteed to reach the pinnacle
[Chorus:]
Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real players and all the fly girls
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real players and all the fly girls
[Verse Three: Sharief]
Feelin the metronome click, my microphone's on
It's time to kiss Sharief to perform
Ya lukewarm, my degrees be uncharted in the centre of fight square
I rum brass knuckle rhymes fuckin with crimes
I'm natural as loaded dice, understand
where no man survives, L.A.W. can
Transform, I see it ain't even worth ya triggers
I'm from the days when B-boys were straight earthin niggas
Standin my arms crossed, toss a grenade
rein-force my zone as a lyrical barricade
You better cuz your dome piece blown
Release chrome beats, nuclear missiles rhymes under my comb
Three strikes marks the villian bustin rhymes
like shots in Sarajevo Saturday night blood be spillin
Some I slaughter such as *?two compel?* blows
Crush your corny kids caught stumblin on my shells, so
sick, too quick, I stab you with some shit
Doin infinite assault these hard lyrics I commit
When I crush your lungs, I keep my pace uptempo
Swingin my prison rhymes, fuckin mics like a nympho
[Chorus:]
Check it out y'all, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real hustlas across the world
Check it out now, L-A-W's raw
L.A.W., the Lyrical Assault Weapon
L-A-W, this might trouble you
For all the real hustlas across the world

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slausson
on my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin
Checkin my rearview, cause niggaz they will do
jack moves, black fools cause I smack fools
Try to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
but I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggaz like lynchin but I just watch them hang
so on, and so-on, why don't you let me roll on
I remember back in the dayz when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak; now everybody
peepin out they windows when they hear me beatin up the streets
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say, every single motherfuckin day, yo
But I ain't trippin I'm just kickin it
While my deez keep spinnin and these hoes keep grinnin I'll be

I'm in a two man cell with my homie Lil' 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a ride, if I don't scrap, I'm gettin' stuck
But that's the life of G, I guess
Ese's way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run cause brothers is droppin' quicker
Ugn, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncin' off the walls, throwin' them dogs
Gettin' that rep as a young hog

Now I'm holdin' the dub, sittin' on swoll
Twenty-seven years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet with my mind on the money
That I be makin' soon as I touch them streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right?
But it ain't no thang to me
Cause now I'm what they call a loced ass O.G.
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so whatcha wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sittin' behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (for what?)
For tryin' to jack the little homies for they grip
Chorus

Somethin' for the real O.G.'s to get with
Some facts made our made
Now you runnin' but I'm played
Like every single day, really doe
You know me, I'm the smooth macadamian
Gamin'em for my homie
No need in be uncalm, if you pack right
And learnin' just enough to keep your sack tight
Late nights, I wonder what they get in for?
Early mornin' on the corners, what they hittin' for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, Eastside's where they swerve now
Not thinkin' about what's really goin' on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county
With nothin' but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
Cause you's a hustlin' ass youngsta, clockin' your grip
Chorus

That's the life of a G, I guess
The ghetto. x3
That's the life of a G
That's the life of a G, I guess

That's the life of a G. The ghetto

Knockin em out their sock 'n'

Breakin em down to the slab
Takin em down on their ass

See ya watch and creak without a motherfuckin paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not that same ol' plain Jane
We're on you like a border, you're nothin more than a crane
Or a pebble, take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level

I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuck

Chewin motherfuckers up like a Hershey Kiss
Put to sleep, rippin the lyrics I'm leavin ??? ???
Rough wind flex too complex, wrecks, then I'm peace
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half niggas
Ya quick ta talk shit I whip your ass nigga
So watch me blast, nigga, cuz I'm the last nigga
ya wanna fuck wit, so up your cash, nigga
I make stagger, ob' skills and jimmy ragged
Home in and drag her, sit wit ya girl and watch me tag her
Pullin steel like a stunt
Sold like an ID card, nigga, no needs ta front, so
here to torment up a track on crack
and I'm strapped witta semi-toll milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks em off, I breaks em off cheap
Deadly as Jason on Friday The 13th
[RBX]
Back in the days, niggas they use to scrap
but now in ninety-due', niggas they pull they strap
Cuz, umm, police dem come wicked and dem shoot
Niggas, so niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute, boom, stompin black soldier
Here ta teach and mould ya
The ennerator, dominator, narrator RB to the motherfuckin X
Flex wicked styl-e, bompin be found into greed by a
Maniac with a gat
See nowadays niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
BOP BOP BOP now I'm on Death Row
Fuck it, niggas goin wild, everynight they shoot
It's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a teflon vest for your chest
Anytime ya step into my hood
But that'll do you know good
One slug to ya face, no hate, you gettin smoked like wood
Nasty nigga but he pumps, face back on the concrete
Here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner cocked with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi lane 5 G's
Lyrical gangbang but it's just a G thang

When darkness be closin in
I'm motivated, with the howlin wind
with a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin that your end is beginnin
Swift silent and deadly
There's no defendin my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch, coulda gotchu at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff {*cameras click*}
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff this here, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the thirty-shot mag {*WHOOSH*}
Bullet stuck to his brain like a mack
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet
This is anybody MURDERAHHH

Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, think how I'ma just work
Give em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder is the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
the fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'da thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, shoulda learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggaz die fast
Thug niggaz die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
and jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
that his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with fo'fo' {*KABOOM*}

Nationowl divides this bomb to blow
Adios serials worldwide
Once inside ya ride, usin the mic like a screwdriver
to break down the speed
While labels were sound asleep, Nowl peeped and creeped
and stole the ground beneath they feet
Far from the bail, still makin my sales
Movin tapes like weight, we's hip-hop cartel
takin over, no doubt
Like thongs, they ass out but win amounts with the Doctor
Dre, all day cash his cheques
Like Play, I hittin you in the head like strays (BUU-YU-KOW!)
Nationowl's defence covers my ass
and team o' outcast niggas who're quick to blast
Our beat's on hit, keep the peace on
MC's couldn't find my path (Where you at niggas)
Chorus:
Pledge a legiance to my team
Let's scheme, nigga, we gots ta get CREAM
Cos worldwide shit's outta control

Young and old, my niggas who's on parole
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Bitches who own, my niggas whose heart is cold
Why you can't get down with Nationowl
Nationowl's anthem, got'cha soul on lock
still fully loaded, cocked the handgun
Composed like the Phantom
while the face of earth gets ugly, we ever lovely
Bitches who never duck me,  Nowl loved me

Assholes around like a frisby
And for satisfaction chew an MC like Wrigley

In the last days, which side will you be on
Nationowl's on the side that I beat on
I demand put me on
From the door I use MC's to wipe my feet on
My shit be bumpin like in-grown hair
For twenty-six years trained in ghetto warfare
Nigga, I see more green than St. Patrick
Pro actors, game of life with no practice
Controllin craps like I had a remote
It's a rule, now go enter ya tomb
No joke, much over I scold
It's some game for all who's tryin ta split ya coats
Best believe that these are our last years
Prepare or get done from the rear

Infra red aimed at your head

Who is the man with the masterplan?
A Nigga Witta muthafuckin' Gun!
[Dr. Dre]
44 reasons come to mind
Why you muthafuckin' brothas hard to find.
He be walkin' on the streets and fuckin' with mine.
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind.
See I never take a step on a Compton block
Or LA without the AK ready to pop.
'Cause them punk muthafuckas in black and white
Ain't the only muthafuckas I gots to fight.
I think it's better to retellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up.
What you niggas lookin at? You do in...
Goddamn, 'cause it's the city.
And for a youth to survive a nigga gotta be a gangster.
And I'm a nigga you can't remove.
Took out a lot of muthafuckas for tryin' to prove
To their homies they can hang by dealin' with me.
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D.
I never did time on a murder yet.
'Cause I relax and back do a job and jet.
Yo, I know you understand my flow,
So here we go when Death Row
Come. Let a mutherfucker know...
[Chorus: 2x]
[Dr. Dre]
D-R-E! A mutherfucker who's known for carryin' gats
And kick raps that make snaps.
Adapts to anything violent that I'm located at.
If you see me on the solo moves believe that I'm strapped.
44, .38 or AK 47.
'Cause Mo' live with Charlie Sheen.
You want a stairway to heaven?
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk mutherfucker flat.
As he wonder what popped before he got popped,
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop.
Now I know you understand my flow,
So here we go when Death Row
Come. Let a mutherfucker know...
[Chorus: 4x]
[Dr. Dre]
I break some off. I break some off.
Yeah, I break some off. I break some off.
Yeah, I break some off.
But I ain't speakin' about between the thighs.
I'm talkin' about cockin' a guage in between your eyes.
That'll make you drop to your knees, 'cause you realise
That a gat will make any nigga civilised.
Old buster ass nigga talkin' bullshit.
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with.
Get lit or hit up by the doctor.
A nigga to break some off properly.
Real G.
So don't doubt it.
I'm the one who's doin' it
While these other niggas talk about it.
And if mutherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my 44 Desert Eagle to his muthafuckin' dome.
And show him why they call me the notorious one.
The name is Dre, E's ward when I'm packin' a gun.
You don't believe me, wants to pop and give it a try.
And if you die you's a buster 'cause real niggas don't die.
But some still don't hear me though.
You're too ninny not to hear me, yo.
So now you know...

No doubt I put it down never slouch
As long as my credit could vouch
A dog couldn't catch me, *ass* out

Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving them ig-asms with my mellow accent
Still moving his flavor with the homeys Blackstreet & Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strickly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Gettin paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby your a perfect 10, I wanna get in
Can I get down so I can win

Curve's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin with the fatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play

I like the way you work it
Trump tight all day, everyday
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time

Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads

No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty from the 313...
[Swift]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes lickin' they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meanin'
Got your whole crew doing subpeonas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadrapalegics outta these non-rappin rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape, it ain't no secret
That your shit sounds fake, you can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in tryin' to stop the crime rate
I'm like Two-Face, I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like route canals
I erase all trails, somethin' farther from gettin' bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linkin' trials
Horrified, and keep on frontin', repentin' and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady fallin' in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW!
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh!
[Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike
Drivin' down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell ""EVERYBODY GET OUT""!
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cuz she found out I was havin' an affair with her 10-year old niece
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313

Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me

I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it...""
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch!

Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits

Ain't nobody iller than me

No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313

the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your
ass'll get smacked
My mothafuckin homie Doggy Dogg has my back
Never let
me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my Nina, then you
know I'm straight trippin'
And I'm a continue to put the rap down, put the
mack down
And if your bitches talk shit, I have ta' put the smack down
Yeah, and ya' don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick
and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, 'til the break dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit
together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better
[Hook: Dr.
Dre & Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Like this, that and this and uh
It's
like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this, and we ain't
got no love for those
So jus' chill, 'til the next episode

You in the office of the good doc again, let's walk again
It's like clock again, the hood rock again
You should pop it in,ain't take it out
That shit play on, you can't make it out
The world ain't set for what I'm about to do
Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two
I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop
Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops
[Snoop Dogg]
We can shoot, we can scrap
We can rap, we can act
We can mack these bitches, whatever you want
Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front
[Dr. Dre]
How it be on the West, forever the hunt
[Snoop Dogg]
But I won't wear no bull's eye (Bull's eye eye)
Bull's eye is how these fools die (Die die)
Waitin' on school by (By by)
Have you on the news by (By)
[Dr. Dre]
Y'all know how the story goes
We give a fuck about award shows
[Snoop Dogg]
Same shit about hoes
[Dr. Dre]
Real niggas own platinum balls
I ain't got it on my neck nigga check my walls
I think y'all just tryin' to insight us
Yo I see how the world can't see these Eastsidaz
All y'all wanna criticize, fuckin' with us tryin' to get a ride
That's when my shit flies
[Snoop Dogg]
And here's where the pimp lies
[Dr. Dre]
I spit game at the globe
First week deuce five
[Hook: Kokane]
I'd rather be ridin' than walkin'
While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin'
All you high paid niggas stay fly
I'ma slide left, fly right on by
I'ma do it on the boulevard
Fast bitches, fast cars and stars
Stayin' boxed up eatin' caviar
Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah
[Dr. Dre with Snoop rapping along]
It's funny how the game goes
New face but they look like the same hoes
I try to get away, everybody wanna hit of Dre
Stay focused, bang I done hit a day
[Snoop Dogg]
Nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies
Niggas mad Dre and Snoop stayin' multi
[Dr. Dre]
Fuck y'all, wanna slice and it's all mine
[Snoop Dogg]
My career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin'
[Dr. Dre]
You thinkin' California all sun and surf, for sho'
I can see you walkin' under the Earth
[Snoop Dogg]
My gun burst em'
[Dr. Dre]
And I still got my first mail
Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt
[Snoop Dogg]
Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest
G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South
Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me
[Dr. Dre]
A word from me, exclusive as a surgery
But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin'
My fingerprints all over the top ten
[Snoop Dogg]
Like that
[Dr. Dre]
Whole staff'll come through and spin
Either on the film or the two-inch wheel
Behind the wheel of a sixty-four
I can't stop till I done fifty totes
[Snoop Dogg]
Y'all motherfuckers know me
I smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like Kobe
[Hook]
[Kokane x4]
Rock on, rock on keep movin' on
Groovin' on and hold ya on

All ways and forever, forever and all ways
The rhythm will flow from now and through all days
As long as the sun shines
As long as Eisenhower's on the dime
Yo, I'll be kickin the rhyme
One time for your mind, your soul, your body
D-O-G's on the side of me, smooth as E   J, hard as Bacardi
Smackin those yaddy-yacks and ducks keep quackin
Hands that are clappin, end up cracklin
under the heat, the pressure from the one that's deffer
Egyptian ruler, call me Cleo or Neferttiti, yes indeedi
Got the eyes that are beedie, body from Tahiti
Voice of the wind lyrics, blow
Chills up ya spine that's illslow
All thoughts in ya mind drop in, yo
You came in the front, but you'll be kicked through the back door
for tryin to step, tryin to come incorrect
tryin to play the left, tryin to start a mess
tryin to cause fuss, tryin to raise a ruckus...Huh
You'll end up ashes to ashes, dust to dust
A busta, you musta been fuckin on drugs
and alcohol back off, all a y'all, up against the wall
Spread 'em, Doggs, go get 'em
Hand-cuff 'em and stuff 'em, cold shed 'em, don't let 'em
utter a word, not another one heard
If you try you die, visions blurred, speech slurred
Served with a cherry on top
Rage in effect I just begun to rock
Yeah, rock on witcha bad self (RAGE!)
Rock on witcha bad self (RAGE!)
Rock on witcha bad self (RAGE!)
Rock on witcha bad self...
[Dat Nigga Daz] (Kurupt)
Yo..I'm Dat Nigga Daz who packs a tre-8 slug
A true nigga from the hood, and the Pound gives love
You see, niggaz wanna be down but never came around
So back up off my nuts, and stop sweatin the Pound
You see, niggaz get broke off like 1, 2, 3
cause I'm the D-A to the.. (D-A-to the..) D-A- to the Z
Now G'z pay attention to this young ass mack daddy
in a Caddy, had he
not known about the city where the niggaz hang around
So I roll 'em up, and hit 'em up with the motherfuckin Dogg Pound
[Kurupt] (Dat Nigga Daz)
I'm rough and rugged, and up to do dirt
I'm from the Dogg Pound nigga so I'm puttin in work
I'm no joke, who the fuck you tryin to provoke
(1-8-7) It's cool how his ass got smoked
I don't drink no fuckin V-S-O-P
I drink a motherfuckin' O.G. Olde E
I'm from the click that be kickin the gangsta shit bitch
Real niggaz real G'z wit real big dicks
I hit 'em up with the Pound, so what you wanna throw up
Claimin you're cocaine or cavi when you blow up
Know what? The Pound's in the motherfuckin house
Back again we try to get high as we can
Dr. Dre, be kickin fat rhymes and produce, and kick shit
I gets more wicked than Beetlejuice
Motherfuckers get battered, so scatter before I keep ya
hostage, a nigga has to like the grim reaper
So, I'm comin from my hood, what hood?
You really like to know, wouldn't you, I thought you knew
Motherfucker don't you know I'm stranded on the Row
I take a look into the crowd kick a style a flow
I'm mashin, motherfuckers get murdered for askin
Relax kid, you're rollin wit a fuckin assassin
I last did dirt the other day
Betray, the role of a G, from the D-O double G
P-O-U-N-D, Pound, so bow down motherfuckin marks
The execution starts, when the Chronic gets sparked
I'm like ??, rough and rugged, cause I'm like baldhead(??)
Wrecks I flex murderous rhymes to leave you all dead
What's said is what's said, it's already spoke
The dead is the dead +I Ain't No+ fuckin +Joke+
I murder motherfuckers as a hobby
One of my idols +Ain't No Joke+, so why in the fuck should I be?
Fly me, to the Bahamas, ruff rhymer, drama's
what you're kickin, wicked is how I'm-a
approach ya, the locster, who's quick to up and smoke ya
You're lookin like a smoka, grinnin like the joker
I yolk ya from da back like a bitch talkin shit
Cause a bitch ain't shit, but a ho and trick, on my dick
Flip, lets take a trip to the Dogg Pound
Fools tried to punk me when I was young, but I'm a hog now
and I gets respect and I step wit a tec 9
Ready to put somethin up in that ass so you respect mine
Fool, Death Row ain't +Lynchin+ and the Pound ain't +Mobbin+
We all don't give a fuck, run in your crib and start robbin
Throbbin, I'll break a nigga down in the 90's
Maxin at the Pound wit my doggs is where you'll find me
Beatch..

Heell yeaah
You niggaz can't fade this shit, you know what I'm sayin?

Swerve in the intersection, I'm done she restin
No question, done session
Home wreckin, Doc motherfuckin Dre no guessin
Nothin less than, I mess when I'm sexin
Bang on the block
Even Asian bitches like to bang cock
Draws drop, she bunny hops
On it like a pro, she comes out the clothes
[DJ Quik]
But, uh, she flips the dildos
Whether in the Pumps, Nikes or the steel toes
Dre, you can spot it in the benzos
Squawtin real low, got me drivin real slow, she's a real ho
And even though her parents spent the fat chip
On that private school chip
She graduated, got some thug dick and flipped
No more checkered sweater, vest and plaid skirts
She's out here naked more or less and that hurts
But she's in good hands, cause Suga Free palmin
He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh she okay she just runnin an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen
Bouncin through the mall, spottin 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him pattin his pocket and comin out his drawers
Layin his jacket on puddles, openin the doors
All for what?
Because I promised her my name gave her the game and still aint fucked

Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue

Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch
When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit

Huh, so I'm out the game huh?
[Eminem]
Yo Dre, we ridin?
[Dr. Dre]
Whatever
[Eminem]
Well I'm witchu homie
[Dr. Dre]
Ok, Let's handle the small shit
[Eminem]
I was born to brew up storms, stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss til I slur up spit
Grew up too quick, knew too much, been through too much shit
Corrupt and now I'ma pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick n' rich, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit, if I ever take shit, I eat shit
Was it for him, Wouldn't be shit
[Dr. Dre]
Creep wit me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been in longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
[Eminem]
But what about Jermaine?
[Dr. Dre]
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think
I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin
I'ma giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a buncha little Mini-You's
Runnin around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't had to do it with 10 or 11 year olds
CHORUS:
[Eminem]
Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh?(echoes)
repeat 1
[Eminem]
Second verse, it gets worst
It gets no better than this
Amatuers drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Cannabis or Dre with a Dupri
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucken again
Dre ain't havin it as long as Im here, play Devil's Advocate
[Dr. Dre]
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone
And bury to make sure the tradition carries on
I would
[Eminem]
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
[Dr. Dre]
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
[Eminem]
And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warnin
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
Cuz I know, if they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mill or grow up to be a tilla'
Go nuts and be a killer
[Dr. Dre]
And I'm somethin of a phenom
One puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (Come On)
CHORUS
[Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars in Elize, partyin all day
But I handle my business cuz it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet
However you want it, you could have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin it your way
That goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway
Cuz this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around and you'll get anahilated
Eyes diliated
[Eminem]
(Ha) like my old lady
Cuz what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
Depending on your mood if it swings, think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed write and my loose leaves my lanch pad
[Dr. Dre]
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest and invest in something
To protect your head and neck
[Eminem]
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source
Ain't holdin' my fuckin breath
But I suffocate for the respect
Fore I breath the collect the fuckin check
CHORUS
[Dr. Dre]
Watch your fuckin' mouth
[Timbaland]
Yo this Timbaland, tell him I said suck (*tchka*) my dick

Yes yes y'all, ooh funk....
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol schizzy with the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh in come funk
Yes yes y'all, to the beat y'all
From the ol schizzy it's the yes yizzy y'all
Ooh notes come wrong
Verse 1:
Dre is chillin, Ruff is chillin
What more can I say (Let's make a million)
M-E-L-Man, niggas call me Most
I be rockin on the East and the West Coast
Your mail go back like Emmitt Smith's hairline
With Jordache devils and Calvin Kleins
This shit be on my mind like O'Donnells interceptions
How would I look with Mike's complexion
Eat me, freak me, take your hand and leave me
All I wanna say is  I don't really give a fuck
cos Most he be mega
Copped the Play Station but still play the Sega
and in the PJ's I DJ and blow amps
Bad as *shrimp stampy* with the food stamps
Huh, I'm not a stranger to danger
On the streets I be known as the jaw rearranger
Heavy with the metal, Mel-Man rule
White boys say it now  Cool, cool, cool!!!
I bring the fizzy that's the obvious
I got a grip but the only clip I load be the floppy disk
In the SP or the MV, see three G
Ho's see me comin in 3-D
I spread Lizzy with ten mates
Hit the skins and I break out like an inmate
Hey yo, that's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shittin on it
Chorus:
(On the world) Shittin on it
(On the world) Shittin on the world
(Here me, yeah, shittin on the world)
*repeat*
Verse 2:
I warm it up like humidity
Mel, okay I'm here til infinity
My shit be outta...space with the Ewok
This is my planet but I never wear the Reebok
When we rock to the beat of accapella
Most reigns supreme, niggas grab your umbrellas
It's time to bounce so where the player, mate
Jealous MC's still drinkin on that  Hator rade
Bitches flirtin with the giggles and chuckles
You'll never get the jezzy bare, knuckle
cos I get a tingle in the jimmy after three days in it
Hold up! Back to the clinic
Uhh, aah, poked your bitch in the eye
then I step like Omega's hifi (AWROOF!)
I walk the earth like Moses
Any mackadocious, I grew up with no chips
Shows I turn out
I got dough but still call my hos on my burnout
But can't phone long distance
I'm a rich nigga still gettin public assistance
Rockin shit on a task cam
Got MC's talkin 'bout  I love you, man
But you can't get my last bud
or my last dove outta beats we be makin
Dre and M-E-L got the whole Earth quakin
That's how it is and that's how I want it
This is my world and I'm shittin on it
Chorus x3
Outro: (over chorus)
Yes yes y'all, ooh funk...

My nigga Dre, droppin heat box on y'all bitch-ass
Yaknahmsayin?  You gotta recognize
L.A. niggaz, connected all over the motherfuckin world, nigga

[Time Bomb]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a rag
Backpack full of cans plus a four-four mag
G'd from the feet up
Blued up from the Zoo, a pi' grew up
Loc'n, smokin and drinkin til we threw up (threw up)
At ?? Park, taggin, hittin fools up
Ditchin my class, just to fuck yo' school up
You don't wanna blast, nigga tuck yo' tool up
But don't sleep, y'all niggaz quick to shoot you
Now there's another motherfucker with no future
But Time Bomb much smoother when I manuever, dope like Cuba
Got em jumpin {*King T starts speakin, indecipherable*}
[King T]
I'm comin ""Straight Outta Compton"" with a loose cannon
Smoke big green, call it Bruce Banner
Watch your manners, at last another blast from the top notch
From way back with the pop rocks, I pop lock witcha
Picture this, Dr. Dre twistin wit Tha Liks
and Hittman bought a fix
Don't trip, it's a Time Bomb in this bitch
Here it tick tick tick tick {*BOOM*}
Wait a minute it's on, I tell it like a true mackadelic
Weed and cocaine sold seperate, check it
From sundown to sunup -- clown done run up
The Aftermath'll be two in your gut, nigga what?
Chorus: Knoc-Turn'al, Kokane
We roll deep, smoke on weed drink and back heat
Requirements for survival each day -- in L.A.!
It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops
Analyze why we act this way -- in L.A.!
[Hittman]
Gimme that mic fool, it's a West coast jack move
They call me Hitt - cause I spit like gats do
cock me back
Bust caps for my max crew, at Fairfax
who used to wear Air Max shoes, that's true
But I grew up where niggaz jack you, harass you
Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your turkish chain, C.K. B.K.
Blued up or flame, I ran wit a gang
I helped niggaz get, jacked for they Dana Dane's
My pants hang below my waistline
I look humble wanna rumble? (yeah yeah)
I bang though, like Vince Carter from the baseline
don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sunshines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian thai, drive-by, six-fo's on switches
[Xzibit]
I was raised in the hood called WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touchin mine you catch a flatline, dead on the floor
Better than yours, drivin away gettin head from a whore
It's AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin with me might get you banned from TV,
cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die, the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
like puttin a pistol up to your face and blastin yourself
[Defari]
Five in the mornin, burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let em come in BLAOW he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggaz, who by fifths by the fo'
and bruise by the case
SLAP YOU in the face with the bass, Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings wit Sedans and gold rings
Haters fold the style, but can't find no openings

Still, still doing that shit, huh Dre?
[Dr. Dre]
Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was  The Chronic  (nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
[Snoop - singing]
If you ain't up on thangs
[Dr. Dre]
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police (ha ha)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still
Chorus:
[Snoop Dogg]
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   (Repeat 2x)
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's  Turn Out the Lights  from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, After-mathematics
In the home of drivebys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E
Chorus
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E   (Repeat 2x)
It ain't nothing but mo hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play dis track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
[Snoop - singing]
So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
[Dr. Dre]
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E  (x3)

Right back up in ya motherfucking ass
'95 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!

No doubt players like me

Yes, it is I says me
And although me
By morning three, cause they're weak
[laughter]
Yes, yo!, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them
But lets take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this...
Path...
Called...
[Verse One: Kurupt]
Stranded on Death Row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggaz know, the flow that I kick, there's no refill
I'm murderin niggaz, Yo, and maybe because of the tone
I kicks my grip, the mic and kick shit
Niggaz can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore, and slam
Nuff respect like a sensei, ba-bash like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin
What don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson
Take a walk through the hood, and we up to no good
Slangin on things like a real ho
G should, I'm stackin and mackin and packin a ten so
When you're slippin, I slip the clip in
But ain't no steady tripppin
Cause it's Death Row, rollin like the mafia
Think about whoopin some ass, but what the fuck stoppin ya
Ain't nathin but a buster
I'm Stranded on Death Row for pumpin slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone
Feel the shotgun, Korrupt inmate cell block one
[Verse Two: RBX]
No prevention from this mention of sorts
Your're a victim, from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braile
From the lunatic, I death like arsenic
When I kick up wicked raps
That the grain will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it, many storms
When I'm vexed, I fly leg necks and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the hillside strangler
MC mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do
The narrator RBX, cell block two
[Verse Three: Lady of Rage]
Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on Death Row
And now I'm servin a lifetime sentence
There'll be no repentence
Since it's the life that I choose to lead
I plead guilty
On all counts let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my matress
Bed frame there's another dead pain
Layin lain with the shame, who's to blame
Me, the lady of Rage
On when I'm comin from the D-E-A-T-H in
R-O-W takin, no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 187 on motherfuckers don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block eight
[Verse Four: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
And yo steppin through the fog
And creepin through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Makin videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin raps for my snaps now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homey little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row cause I wanted to make a quick one servin my rocks
And I'm still, servin for mines, peace
To my motherfuckin homies doin time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin with your blues on, mad as hell
And you say yeah fuck the police
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's drivin the cops crazy
But ain't nuttin but a black thing bay-bee, uhhh
No I'm not flaggin, but I'm just saggin
I betcha don't wanna see the D-O double G
And you can't see, the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin homey D.O.C.
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin DJ
That's my homey and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break em down with the motherfuckin Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat em man
We gotta smoke em, then choke em
Like the motherfuckin peter man
It's like three and to the two
And two and to the one
Cell block four peace Doggy Dogg's done
[Outtro : Bushwick Bill]
Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong, see if you can travel on
Cause only the weak, will try to speak
Those who are quiet, will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that MAKE things happen!

I'ma say this and I'ma gettin mine. If you ain't down for the Africans
here in the United States, period point blank. If you ain't down for the
ones that suffer in South Africa from apartheid and shit. Devil you need to
step your punk ass to the side and let us brothers and us Africans step in
and start puttin some funk in that ass
[Hook:]
Break em off sometin [8x]
[Chorus: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die
[repeat]
[Verse One: Dat Nigga Daz]
They wonder where me bailin and don't really understand
The reason why they take me life and me ???? hand
Me not out for peace and me not Rodney King
Me gun goes click, me gun goes bang
Them riot in Compton and them riot in Long Beach
Them rion in they Lakers and don't really wanna see
niggaz start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock it down at seven o'clock, then again it's like Beirut
Me don't show no love cuz it's us against them
Them never ever love me cuz it's sport to break de,
and kill at my own risk if I may
Delay to spray with my AK and put it to rest
[Interlude: news report]
Yes we have. There have been riots, ahh, rioting, well I don't wanna say
rioting but there's been looting downtown, but right now Bree, what I want
to show you is, they have started fires down at the end of the street
[Bridge:]
[All] How many niggaz are ready to lose?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] What you wanna do?
[All] I said how many niggas are ready to lose
[RBX] Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9
[Interlude: guy talking]
Nobody told us today, in otherwords,
You're still a slave. No matter how
much money you got, you still ain't shit
[Verse Two: Dr. Dre]
Sittin in my livin room calm and collected
Feelin mad, gotta get mine respected
cuz what I just heard broke me in half
and half the niggaz I know, plus the niggaz on the Row, is bailin
Laugh now but cry much later
Ya see when niggas get together they get mad cuz they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They find that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
with the Ese's thumpin, nigga it's time ta rob and mob
(And break the white man off somthin lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so they can't love me)
Yo straight puttin down gettin my scoot on
Let's jump in off in Compton so I gots ta get my loot on
and come up on me some furniture or sometin
Got a VCR
in the back of my car
that I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
Cuz they will see that I can't be stopped
Cuz I'ma cock my Glock and pop til they all drop
[Interlude: news report]
There has been videotape and you can see of the, aah, some of the crowd
throwin things at the officers
And swingin at them as well. Like there was a young woman there. You see
she took a swing at an officer with some object in her hand
[Bridge:]
[All] How many niggaz are ready to lose?
[Snoop] Yeah, so what you wanna do?
[Dre] What you wanna do?
[All] I said how many niggas are ready to lose
[RBX] Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9
[Chorus: RBX]
I got my finger on the trigger so niggaz wonder why
But livin in the city it's do-or-die
[repeat]
[Verse Three: RBX]
One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
187 time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints so a 9 I throw away
or get prints so my Uzi witta spray
POP POP POP another motherfucker drop
And I get relived like *?Bop Bop says?*
smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't no dead do', I'm high off the indo
Creepin with the quickness to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on that donut
And cracker so now he best to back up
I guess I gots ta pack up, fillin the clip up, I zip up-
town, the motherfuckin cops are all around
Helicopters flyin
These motherfuckers tryin
to catch me and stretch me on Death Row
but hell no's the poor black refuse to go
[Interlude: news report]
This is now coverin a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these
fires have been, aah, ignited. I mean, from here to the, aah, to the south
end of South Central is a long way
[Hook:]
Break em off sometin [8x]
[Verse Four: Dat Nigga Daz]
The outcome of this is destruction so the more fall
Niggaz don't give a fuck so tem bust and before
niggaz backin up three black shows
No justice so they copied ya right
and here I am again, me, turn the other cheek, me
Be too many wigs got me 9 to my tights
so me bust, flick cuz he don't give a fuck
and me don't give a fuckin of my problems
In with their FUCK FUCK
[Outro: Snoop Doogy Dogg]
Blak blam, blam to dem fall

Diggity Daz and RBX them bust gun shots
Come again!

This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P.
.. {*Mary J. Blige sings in the background*} ..
A message to God
.. {*Mary J. Blige sings in the background*} ..
[Dr. Dre]
Since you finishin em early, what posessed you to start him
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do  I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doin when you made us; so with all due respect
you coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it
I'm feelin like my whole world is blinded - wonderin why
Cryin, pourin out my heart, pourin out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguin tellin the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watchin him grow
Don't know what hurts more - seein him leave, or watchin him go
[Mary J. Blige]

The way that I do.. {cause I got to get this money}
So don't worry about me.. {cause I know my way around}
I'm just hustlin everyday, runnin this race, makin this paper
[Dr. Dre]
Youse a soldier, you're probably packin heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face
to straight breakin down and showin all emotions
I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'ma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you

Motherfucker I'm Dre

Cos my '4 on hit

(I heard Sam was going solo) God damn, you didn't know so,
well I can blast fast so freak an ill type of slow flow.
I'm hitting harder than Berry Boss so check the golden child,
throwing it to your ear-hole, got you going buck wild.
But truck-tracks, rhymes all day, breaking off niggaz proper,
did dirt, did West cause I clown coppers (yeah).
Do hip-hop, rap, compose 'em most, I couldn't see me,
mad advanced and my skills are all about the dollar bills.
From Pittsburgh to Cali dropping bombs like that,
was on the D.L. with the squad so I couldn't hold it back.
Black, I regulate I buzz a big gate figure,
mobbing with the ill nigga, with his finger on a bigger trigger.
Serving all (saps), hitting sevens on the (simps),
making do', eating shrimps, locing with some real pimps (yeah).
So peep game, best believe I love my peeps
that's why I make the type of music you can pump in your jeeps
(that's right).
So buck my sound, I put it down for the underground,
I got the women cause I'm slamming, jamming.
Got it going on this time for this new producer to rise,
so open your eyes, I think you better recognize.
[Hook: Dr. Dre (Sam Sneed)]
Once again it's the man with the masterplan,
they call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) [2x]
[Verse Two: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]
I remember days on the blocks where I slang slung played punk cops
and mad props cause I ran with hard rocks (yeah).
From napalms to Uzi's I made G's (say what?),
them build up enough Luther by keys.
No gang affiliation, yo I stood on my own to pulling capers
I'm a sneaky slick nigga, I never had to pull the trigger (right).
I mack, and on top and that I'm used to staying wicked with just 24-7,
you can ask my ex-hooker.
But now I'm on some new improved shit,
making hits, stacking chips, now everything's legitimate.
I flipped the scrip a long time ago, on the five-o,
when I had to scope with this new way to make my cash flow (uhm).
Yes indeedy, I wasn't greedy, got my niggaz out the gutter,
now they're rolling with the Sam Sneezy.
Hip hop fanatic causing static in the industry,
these whack creators, I call 'em imitators (ah yeah).
Been trying to see me, but see I'm unexplainetory,
with the fame and glory, that's why I gotta tell my story.
With no disguise, a lot of niggaz despise,
because I'm on an uprise, so I think you better recognize.

Once again it's the man with the masterplan,
they call him Sam and I (think you better recognize) [2x]
(Think you better recognize) [2x]
[Verse Three: Sam Sneed (Dr. Dre)]
Well I'm back in the mix with a bottle of hennessy,
so fire up a blunt let's have an end of the sanity.
Crazy shot outs giving pounds to all my niggaz,
hitting all the hookers by the dozen, cause they dig us (trick).
Fuck what you've heard, recognize what you be seeing,
it's time to earn truth to the game human being.
I'm that little bass nigga trying to get mine, fuck a nine,
cause I'll incline with the mastermind.
I got my crew in my corner so I can't loose,
cause I'm paying mad douze in this record biz, I don't snooze.
And suckers be popping at those idiotic egosytible type of flimflam,
I can't be faded Sam-am.
Playing with the hustlers never dealing with the knucklehead bollers,
cause boys play with toys and scholars play with dollars.
I'm a mack of my own right, plus my game is tight,
baby get it right, I ain't the one, so take flight.
Bitches give my mad rep, nothing but the brazen off tempo,
thinking they can get my loot, I never trip to knock the boots.
I gotta be wise, when time to dip between the thies,
all eyes on the price, so I think you better recognize.
[Hook: Dr. Dre: (Sam Sneed)]
Once again it's the man with the masterplan,

[Verse One: RBX]
While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts
I come with no fronts and smash in monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyata driven
True and livin drivin with the gat
Uhh, pop the clutch, let the Cold Crush rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diezel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic
East coast (killer), West coast (killer) [repeat 4X]
[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nutsac yo I stay focused
Beefin without skills seekin will only weaken
The artist speakin over beats and, you be cheatin
Cacaphony of small talent rappers, claimin a coast
over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher hip-hopppin ya correctly
Ignorant ass MC's continue to tempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock
Too many MC's rappin causin lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
Whattyou think this is? KRS-One from the Bronx kid!
East coast (killer), West coast (killer) [repeat 8X]
Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constituional rights have been suspended
[Verse Three: B-Real]
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast trippin goin on through out the business
East Coast West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'ma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
from Central to Westland Avenue, without my glock
But some niggaz can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killin in the highrise
office, analyzing the song
Look at them red niggaz, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggaz bringin the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill
Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!
East coast (killer), West coast (killer) [repeat 8X]
[Verse Four: Nas Escobar]
Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, are mergin at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real
to make a meal, but when plan fold, nigga you squeal
like Heavy Heel, but what's the fuckin deal?
East coast (killer) West coast (killer) [repeat 16X]

Checkin lockers, Mexican connect to play soccer
PH's and cockblockers
Ho-hoppers, weez niggaz is off the rocker
Sippin? cranberry juice on rocks with vodka
With 'Pac and Poppa, and Red Foxx's doctor (fo? real?)
Takin names and takin orders
Ya fake ya name, and I'm all up on ya

Palm trees and 6-3's on deez

That's right, I like bi-sexual women, fuck dykes
Suck dick? No, but your father might
Fuckin hermaphrodite!
Duck the IRS, fuckin Howard Stern's wife
In traffic, bitch gave me head in real life

[Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
Chorus: Kurupt (repeat 2X)
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
[Xzibit]
Yo I stay wit it
While you try to perpetrate, play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
(Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference
Chorus
[Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up!
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say
Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
(The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
[Dre] Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
[Em] I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
[Dre] Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
[Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream,  I Just Don't Give a Fuck,  and see who means it!

West coast shit nigga
Overdosage - imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch; don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch, gobble the dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up!
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimpslapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimpin hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggaz paid for hoes, just to lay wit hoes
Relax one night, and paid to stay wit hoes
Captain Save'Em all day (bitch) well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin pussy, or hittin the switch
You into hittin bitches off of the grip, you punk bitch
[Nate Dogg]
All my real Doggs still kick it wit me
All my down hoes still trickin wit me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never loved no hoe
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checkin for me
All the real smokers know
Nate ain't passin nuttin but dope indeed...
Real trees...
Chronic leaves...
No seeds...
When I had you last night, baby
Before - I blew yo' mind, (blew-blew-blew your mind)
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more - now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Hmmm-hmmmhmmmm...
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby, hit the bong
while the west coast rolls along
While we - still makin gangsta hits
You'll be - still jockin gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you slick
Somebody better get this biiitch, this biiiitch
[Hitman]
I got these freaky hoes
Clappin they hands, stompin they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimpin bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Lemme drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave ya boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the hoe
She got freaky in yo' sixty-fo', I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin the hoe for fo' days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mall
They be beepin me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiendin, they on the nuts
But beitch, I'm out ya pussy when I nut, f'real

I'm livin a motion picture
Me and my niggas, and 16 bars

What is this? Everybody's jiggy now
Is the hustle that good in
everybody's city now? Or do they act good?
I pimp on the street, I pimp in my sleep
And when I snore it sounds like
I'm sayin ""Wheres my money?""
I aint playin, I'm out there
Like, ""Wheres my honies?""
You gotta be a pimp to understand
Just how I'm layin
Fuck a Lex bubble, I'm rich
And after this
I'ma be rich all over again, except double
See, you aint so hard if you aint burnin rubber
In somethin with numbers after the dot, you aint no star
Me and my whole crew, did either shot a nigga
Or been shot, and if you chuck us out, aint no scars
Hint: steppin to me is suicide
And that basically means that you can die

My lifes in the fast lane
Thats when I knew I had game
When class came I had hoes
But didnt know they last name
In school, when you niggas was tradin clothes
Me and my niggas was tradin hoes

Carry my books you hoe
I had 'em slavin, yo
I get scarred then I played the hoe
Like ""Way to go""

Holdin a black Mack-11
Under the black leather
Platforms, a hat with a feather
I was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi
All we did was throw parties
And show up with Gold Gotti
Handsome, endsome, I'm the one you ran from
Cuz you could only be the man in the shit
That I was banned from
Make this shit seem easy
Fiends need me
Make the most conceited chick
In this bitch seem sleazy
Pleased at what I'm doin
And to all yall pimp niggas
Pimp on, and I'll see yall at the reunion

Put up the tools and clips ; did a few pulls and dips; needin a shower
smack my baby girl on the hip. I'm on the move kid  I'll
catch you bout seven; shit  showered and strapped and now I got my
engine revin'. Supereior handling   still got money left from
gambling with these kids that I met through these southern joints be
scramblin'. Turbo-boost, driving at exorbitant speeds; I
proceed to roll a phil cause I can drive with my knees. The way I lay it
down, please, bring new meaning to squeeze - Let my mind
coast from ki's to dungarees to Gee's Loose ones and tons of fiends on
the Hip-Hop scene, but what was once a guillotines',
semi-auto sub machine - I dream elaborate - though it's gettin badder it
doesn't matter yet......livin life as we imagined it
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD TODAY /
BROTHERS BE BUSTIN BROTHERS FOR
LESS THAN TIME OF DAY
FOR PAY / I'D LIKE TO CHANGE THE WAY THE
CHILDREN PLAY AND TEACH THE
WORLD A BETTER WAY
Said I was coolin, puffin La; I heard a knock at the door, and when I
opened, yo, you couldn't guess what I saw - It was the body
of this kid in my life I never seen, on the ground, shorty didn't even
look 16. Must've took it to go cause I ain't even hear the
sound - Pulled him in from the hall with wifey holdin me down - He
looked dead at a glance, then his eyes did a dance, and he
spoke to me while my lady called the ambulance - Told me ""Listen
to the
words when a wise man speaks, many men search the
world and never find what they seek"" - On the verge of tears,
looking at
what's left of his chest....My girl came, wiped his head
while I had a towel pressed on his torso - moreso than not he's
gonna
die, but I'm tellin him he'll be okay, I gotta lie - It's this
thing called life so many times we take for granted - I hit the La,
search deep, and try my best to understand it HOOK The final
minutes, seconds penetrate my days like a knife....To us all the
promise
death, I bring the promise of life - In my mind I see the
time as my eyes see the truth - I see the setting of the sun inside the
eyes of the youth.....As I travel God's creation hoping still
to see the sight that give meaning to the splendor of a sunrises light -
I disappear in the night to be absorbed in the black - to
stack up all of the facts, so when I countereact - a full pack - fully
auto, razor like a laser bear - silent but deadly the theme - you
might envy the team, for the wealth, loving God is only good for
your
health - as for mine - hope to say in time the same for
yourself - you're nice - I be just as....too live to debate - I rock the
rugged rhymes that bust ass.....keep food on my plate Just a
quarter of the calliber a brother contains and I'm not playing a game
One Love, and one aim HOOK

how was your day at work
I bet you're tired
so just sit down
and take a load off for awhile
here's a little back rub
tell me when it gets to be too much
by the way supper's almost done
Oh and I know you're probably thinking
that I've done something wrong
'cause it's been so long
since I've done anything for you like this baby
it's just that I've finally had a day off
to get caught up with the one that I love
I'll do anything you want
do anything you ask
to try to make things easier
you're wish is my command
I'll do anything you want
whatever you desire
and I know it may seem odd
but if you ask me why
I'll tell you why
no particular reason hey
'cause I just felt like doin' somethin' nice for you today
let's go upstairs
let me show you what's next
I hope you like it
it's a bubble bath and some wine by candlelight
I'll sponge you down with kisses
then we can do the business
if you want
the night's still young baby baby
you've got my undivided attention
there will be no interruptions
I've unplugged the phone
the nights all yours
I've been so busy and
perhaps it's my fault
but now that I have got some time off
I'll do anything you want
There's no woman in this world
who can do all the things you do for me
I can never measure up to you girl
but please believe
that I'll try harder to make things easier
to prove I'm worth your time and
make sure I keep you mine oh...

Uhh.., y'all wanna know something that I've learned?
You really can't love somebody until you've lost the love of someone
It was a hard lesson for me, I'm a tell you about it
My man Ho' Brown gon' hold me down
If I never see you again, yo, I'll remember you
I'll remember your smile and all the things that it could do
I remember your touch that could erase all of time
And hold on to memories until I lose all my mind
If we never kiss again I'll remember your toes
Held you in the air every time your eyes closed
It's like I dwell upon nights until I lose all energy
Find it hard to find it factual, the memories
Of one two shared, it was me who was scared
Now it's like we never met and yo, I find it so weird
To be without you, you who told me all time we'd share
Without you, me the only reason that you're not here
Sometimes I find it hard to walk, see you left me no crutch
Never knew love could hurt me so fucking much
Friends tell me move on I tell them that I can't forget her
And on the low, I've got to do my next love better
[Chorus x2: Horace Brown]
Cause you're so vain
I bet you think this song's about you
All the same
Girl, I've got to do my thing without you
Now if I lived to be a thousand I couldn't forget your walk
It's a walk that very few can maintain in New York
With your head so high and your hair so fly
And a face that's full of cheer even after you cried
And I apologise, baby, believe me I do
I know it's hard for you to see but I was crazy about you
Convo: more than witty, persona of a cutie
The crazy pretty titties, we was working on the booty
The beginning has us winning like the end had me sinning
With a fetish for undressing well-dressed women
Behind me now my company is all good men, they say
I'll get over with you with time but, yo, it won't go away
And it's often I play with the thought of a sequel
But whenever we speak it's like we're two different people
So I wrestle with the memories like men and marietta
Given the chance I'll do my next love better cause
[Chorus x2]
Now I recall us laying in bed and seeing stars through the ceiling
Remember that shit, yo, if I lived to be a million
I be feeling that it was in the script that we got together
To be broken up forever, official for whoever
Or who will, I made the joint maybe true
I tell her that it's her but it's a little bit of you
In me playing it, less the antics, taking her for granted
The semantics of romantics in alignment like the planets
Too far, I'd done come to play roach notes
Now I live to share my love with whom I give couture coats
Consistency, stability and sex with agility
Now I know senility, better yet humility
Cause my baby's love picked me from off the ground
And I'm proud to say old-timers had me holding them down
People can say whatever, never would've done better
But I did and now I finally got my shit together
[Chorus x2]
