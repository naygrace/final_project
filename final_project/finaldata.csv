Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up
Look Look
Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world got you gased up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none
This guy ain't no mother-fucking MC,
I know everything he's got to say against me,
I am white, I am a fucking bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom,
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom.
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shoots
himself in the leg with his own gun,
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl,
I'm still standing here screaming ""FUCK THE FREE WORLD!""
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? he's real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, He's shook
'Cause there no such things as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook
Fuck the beat, I go acapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie,
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me.

Smokin the leak leaky
Ten Freaky girls inside the Chin Tiki
When you look at me you better believe me
This ain't a game and pimpin ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl say what up Doe!
Chin Tiki girls Chin Chin Chin Tiki girls

"3","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/lose_yourself-lyrics-10632.html","eminem","Lose Yourself ","Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?  Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

May I have your attention please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here
Y'all act like ya never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whooping her ass worse than before
They first were divorce, throwin'her over furniture (Ahh!)
It's the return of the...
Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding,
he just didn't say what I think he did, did he?
And Dr. Dre said...
Nothing you idiots! Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!
(Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
{*Eminem's vocal turntable*} Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the anecdote
Women wave your panty-hoes, sing the chorus and it goes
1-    I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
Cuz I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records
Well I do so  Fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear them argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee
I should download her audio on MP3 and show the whole world
how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me!
Repeat 1
I'm like a head trip to listen to cuz I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be frost or sugar coated at all
I just get on a mic and spit it and whether you like to admit it
I just shitted better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny cuz at the rate I'm going when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin'but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King spitting on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming  I don't give a fuck!
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta ya mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
Ha ha
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up

"5","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/8_mile-lyrics-10629.html","eminem","8 Mile ","Sometimes I just feel like
Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like
(blabbering)
It ain't my fault
Great big eye balls
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo, I'm going the fuck home
Rolling my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
Walking these train tracks
Tryin to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors a big brother, a mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep, my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please, I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it
You didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
It's different and it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibiiity
You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve mc's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
I'm 8 Mile Road
I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Just the two of us.. (8X)
[Eminem]
Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama?  She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she?  We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya?  (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night?  Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca?  Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock?  (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE!  (whoooooshhhhh)
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
And when we ride!
Just the two of us.. (2X)
Just you and I!
Just the two of us.. (4X)

Just me and you baby
is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you

If you ever need anything, just ASK

god she said i look like a porcupine
would it be better if i took a hike with frankenstein
maybe i'll start thinking of giving my bike to palestine
meet my friend brit
she get real pissed off when muthafuckers ain't feelin her shit
she'll make you bleed if you fuck around with her per fit

Patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer (?)
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
As a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood
That I used as an excuse
And aint shit changed
But kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind
You and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not?  Blow your brain out
I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board
That smashed into your Honda Accord
With a 4 door Ford
But a more toward (?) droppin an accapella
The choppa (?) fella
The mozarella
Worse than a hellacopta propella
Got you locked in the cella
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
While I'm standin next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins
Feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance
And driven
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants
And given
A less than 20 percent chance
Of living
Have a possible placement
It's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream  I'M STILL ALIVE!
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired a arson
To set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit (?)
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said case closed end of discussion
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombas (?)
We blowin up your house killing your parents 
and coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I aint making no more threats
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack (?) 
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath
Walk the block with a labrador
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore
Verbal cow manure
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure

Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick accapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forgot a gold digger's succubus , my souls thick with ruggedness

I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming (bitch)

Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent my temperment
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impitant
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show (so)
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho (now)
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nympho maniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate, yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blasterate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Bucking these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leaving them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up?
Well I'ma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own with the strength of Lou Forigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
Chorus: Eminem
So what you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me
If you ever wanna be one see
Eye-Kyu: Now what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be the sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
Verse 2: Eminem
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never beat the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will and be sealed your casket closed you still gonna be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jay Rue jacking off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I showered the slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with E's
Dethrone MC's and I'ma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder then you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow follower's singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands if they swallowed their
fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack
Chorus: Eye-Kyu
So what you know about a sweet MC, from the 313
None of these skills you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me
So you ain't ever gonna be one see

None of these skills that you just seen come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you'll never become me

Quitting I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Something ain't right
Hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright
Drawing a blank like
(blabbering)
It ain't my fault
Great big eye balls
My insides crawl
And I clam up
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I have just been ripped
So I must then get
Off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit
Yo, I'm going the fuck home
Rolling my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
Walking these train tracks
Tryin to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move ASAP
Get a new plan
Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV buries her nose in her pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors a big brother, a mother and dad
Ain't no telling what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep running from something I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like a grew up but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't got a rep, my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please, I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homie wherever you are
Yo, I'm telling you dog I'm bailing this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Road
I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
You gotta live it to feel it
You didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is
Why it was and it still is
To be walking this borderline of Detroit's city limits
It's different and it's a certain significance
A certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibiiity
You'd never seen, heard, smelled or met a real mc
Who's incredible or on the same pedestal as me
But yet still unsigned
Having a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve mc's in the lunch line
When it comes crunch time
Where did my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't having to run with this little rabbits but fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet
I'm starting to doubt shit
I'm feeling a little skeptical who I hang out with
I live like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army trying to salvage an outfit
And it's cold
Trying to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battling mode
My defenses are so up
The one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
This city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I just feel like I'm being pulled apart
From each one of my limbs
By each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not
What I'm doing, I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to u-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' on next time I'll meet a new girl
I can not only play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat all I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur
I'm 8 Mile Road
I'm a man
Gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man I'ma never look back
And I'm gone
I know right where I'm going
Sorry, momma, I'm grown
I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps I'm making my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

Yeah..50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo
G-UNIT!
[Lloyd Banks]
This rap shit plays a major part of my life
So if you jeapordize it I got the right
To send a mothafucka at you tonight
G-Unit! And I ain't stoppin' to my clique poppin'
Swimmin' in barrels of money
Ma could walk around wit' a head up and challenge you dummy
It's funny, niggas rather see you sufferin' and hungry
I'm hungry as hell, skatin' with another nigga's money
Take your hats off, you know you ain't that tough
I'm callin' your bets off as soon as you act up
You know what I came for, it isn't the game ball
Artillary that's about as long as a chainsaw (Lloyd Banks!)
By the way, this feels like I'm dreamin'
Forty cal. under my pillow, condom feelin' my semen
The physical presence of a female, form of a demon
That's why, I fuck 'em and leave 'em
Get my nut while I'm breathin'
'Cause they thought they'd catch me slippin', now I'm duckin' and trippin'
That's a thousand dollar outfit what the fuck is you rippin'?
You trippin', more records could get my ass in position
Death wish for no religion whether Catholic or Christian
Listen, I went through my ambition in and out the kitchen
With probable cause, it's probably sendin' out to prison
You got soldiers, but you still gotta respect ours
We got more four five's and nines than a deck of cards
[Tony Yayo]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me ('Cause what?)
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Niggas hate when you do good
But when you broke, your friends and your enemies
They love you, they love you
Cheche, get the llello
Picture me being crack, out of town, trips on the trail
Cheche, get the llello
Picture me being crack (Tony Yayo!)
You can sift me, cut me, I'll turn you to a junkie
I'm the number one seller in the whole fuckin' country
Wallstreet niggas, they cop me on the low
White boys don't call me coke, they call me blow
It's time to go, on the bus, the train, the plane
I'll smuggle, I'm nothin' but trouble
I'll make your money double
Cook me in baking soda
I'll turn your Hooprock into a new Range Rover
I'll pay all your bills and fill your 'frigerator
Feed your family, turn your man into a hater
Put me in your doorpanels or your stashbox
Put me in your Nik's, Timbs or Reeboks
If you cop three and a half you hustlin' backwards
Cop a hundred grams, you movin' forwards
You tryin' to move more birds
...In PA all day, on the corner of Third
[50 Cent]
You can take me out the 'hood, but can't take the 'hood out me (what?)
'Cause I'm ghetto, I'm ghetto
Picture me polishin' pistols, I'm comin' to get you
The shells hit you, you screamin'
Think I'm playin'? I mean it
Man, I done bought all these pistols
Lets get it poppin'
Start wavin' my emboies shell cases get the droppin' (C'mon)
Like if it's down the corner, I got too much pride to hide
I'm outside, gun in my pocket just stunnin' I'm stoppin'
I'm dyin' to pop it, I'm young and I'm restless, you know my contestants
As the world turns, there's lessons to be learned
Count all my blessin's, clean up my weapons
I'm ready for war, the strong survive, the weak will parish
I told you before, hoes they compliment me now like  50 nice chain
Malasio, twenty grand in chips at a dice game
Burn out, can't stop gotta watch MTV, BET
Nigga you see me!
I wonder if you mad, 'cause I'm doin' good
or 'cause niggas feelin' me more than you in your own 'hood
And it hurts 'cause you love 'em and they don't love you back
'cause they know you just rappin' and you don't bust a gat
You pussy
Yeah, explain it to niggas in your hood nigga
They know you fuckin' frontin' nigga
Talkin' like gangstas on a record, I see you nigga
Niggas know me nigga, ask around in my 'hood nigga
Read the  Daily News  nigga you see them talkin' about me nigga
I'm in the middle of all kinds of shit
Pussy, lets get it poppin'

[Intro - Eminem]
WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! {*laughs*}
Guess who's back?!?!
Mommy! We're home!!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!
[Verse - Eminem]
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was
50, Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from (?) be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off
[Chorus - Eminem]
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the K's get to scream
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
[Verse - B-Real]
Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon
[Chorus]
[Verse - Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s

Somebody hold me back
Im unstoppable
I got more guns than a mothafuckin arsenal
Somebody hold my crack
While I fix my plaque
For not bein black
N makin rap
Well anyways
I really gotta take a crap
N maybe get a snack
But u know ill be back
To write another track
Another verbal attack
Freestyle 2:
Yo I get up in the morning and im tired as hell
stretch out on my bed its already 12
get a bite to eat nothing too sweet or I be bouncing up and down all over the street
I put on my stuff and my bling bling and I rap man I don't sing doin my own thing
like nobody else in the rap game I built myself a rap name and I share in the rap fame
with all the others who claimed rap as a second language like a home to go to when they're feelin alone or bored too
and sometimes feelin caught in a cartoon its like a fantasy world with cars, cash, n money,
but it aint even funny
how real it is and u hav no idea how I feel in it
I feel so real in it
my pains from my childhood this is really healin it
I used to be concealin it
everything is so clear now
theres nothing I gotta fear now
I made my self a career now
it aint the same no more
everyday I walk in the door
and feel like a different man than I was b4
things hav changed but im still the same,
inside me ill never rearrange my brains i still fuck like a mofo,
ballin like a real pro,
mad hops like u've never seen befo gimme the ball and watch the show
got range like a black man speed like a track man agility too, u'll never see me slack man,
I make every ball in the rack man, if u thinking of shootin, ill eat u up like pacman
Freestyle 3:
Everyonce in a while I make yo bitch smile
Cuz I rap so good I can make yo bitch wild
cuz the chicks dig it and they gotta love the style of the illest rapper from here to the nile.
yeah dog fosheezi
I hope u know yo honey likes to please me I rap till im wheezy
even when im sneezing u just gotta?
get me the keyzeez to drive me here and all the clothes to cover up thee rear
u just gotta get me the food when I want it and when I got the urge u gotta get me the Chronic
better be on it
as fast as Sonic..
faster.. for the master
of the sport
even all over the court
and no I don't mean with the law
I mean bas-ket-ball dogg don't fuck wit me or ill hav to put u in ur cas-ket
n all that's not all though
ill come to ur funeral and shoot over and over like Ronaldo
they'd all go hiding like Waldo (Damn Wheres Waldo)
Yo ill never stop spittin the rhymes that I've written over the years publicity like monica and Clinton
winnin Grammies come wit tears and they don't come easy and if they do damn that shits measly yeah?
Freestyle 4: (FatMan)
I mean this guy can cause an earthquake
His favorite part of the day is his snack break
Damn just bake him a cupcake and make him a cookie
He sits around all day and daydreams about nookie
More cusion for the pushin right?
well ok, but only if you ever get to pushing, aight?
At the gym I can find your ass up on the Stairmaster
But you're on level two shit go a lil faster
Look man I'm not going to lie
ill tell u how I feel
They should handcuff your big ass to the treadmill
Its don't take a genius to figure out you were fed well
If u go on a diet maybe u can shed a lil
I see u at the store u buy out the whole aisle
It take you 20 minutes just to run a whole mile
Freestyle 5: Shaq (diss)
#34 LA Lakers Man fuck shaq
Most Valuable Player? Man fuck that
Shaq's just a black man wit a 6 pack
He only good cuz he can grab a wall n tear a brick back
Is he number one? man hell no hova
He wouldn't be even if hell froze ova
Kobe rocks that joint up in tinsel town
When u need an answer he can make the shit go down
But shaqs got
No shot and they all think that he's so hot (he's so not)
Always the same thing hes like a robot
Just get it into Shaquille so he can dunk it for 2 points
By the time he gets out of the key you'd have smoked up two joints
He weighs so much (oh! can some-bo-dy hear two oinks)
He ate so many crunches that now his belly boinks
Theres a reason the Magic traded away the Shaq pack
They were getting angry they wanted the sun back
And for when they went to games
They wanted the fun back
And they hope that Shaq never brings his nasty buns back
Because nobody likes him
Im sorry, your done Shaq
I hope u understand no pun to be intended
I hope ur mama sees the son that shes invented
Im sorry Mrs O neal
I understand how you must feel
This nightmare is so real
But chill, maybe he'll get killed
Freestyle 6: (8 mile)
talk about 7 mile, change your style, I read your bio, u really from Ohio, im vile, this guys so fuckin fat you cant even see his eyes when he smiles
Freestyle 7: (8 Mile)
that shit was whack, you aint spittin, as a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
Freestyle 8: (8 Mile)
I can seat her and put her to the test,
battling this chick,
with no breasts,
and why you got me battling a chick,
especially one that's whack,
wit a dick,
I really don't understand,
why this chick is up here right now,
but wants to be a man

Since the day I met you
And after all we've been through
Still addic,
I'm addicted to you
I think you know that it's true
I'd run a thousand miles to get you
Do you think I deserve this?
I tried to make you happy
I did all that I could
Just to keep you
But you left anyway
I'm tryin' to forget that
I'm addicted to you
But I want it
And I need it
I'm addicted to you
Now it's over
Can't forget what you said
And I never
Wanna do this again

How long will I be waiting?
Until the end of time
I don't know why I'm still waitin'
I can't make you mine

I'm addicted to you
But I want it
And I need it
I'm addicted to you
I'm tryin' to forget that

Aiyo, when I step up in the bar
Everybody hit the fuckin? floor
Lucky motherfuckers make it to the door
Cause when I spit on mic's, I spit raw
Which cause confusion from the bar to the dance floor
I keep the club owner vexed
Cause he gotta pay me when I spit
Plus replace a lot of shit
Niggers get to wildin?
When my words echoes the room like
(Get your hand out my pockets)
You sock shit while my topics rockin?
I'm banned from clubs cause of my toxic tonsils
Loud speakin? like a fuckin? sports announcer
I spit the block hot ?til you rush the bouncer
Or rush the motherfucker in your way who's bouncin?
You know O. Trice get the gats pronouncin?
Get loud motherfucker when I speak motherfucker
Out your seat motherfucker, I'ma reach motherfuckers
Shady Records ?til I sleep motherfucker
Obie Trice, nothin? but street, motherfucker
Tear this bitch up until you bleed motherfucker
I wouldn't give a fuck who you be, motherfucker
Punk, pussy, bitch or G, motherfucker
Adrenaline Rush before you leave, motherfucker
When I speak I blow out your tweeters
A dog
Show out with speakers
Roll out with heaters
I'm just a animal eatin? the game
Jungle monkey
Funky, and Obie's the name
I roll solo
Never been a hoe, though
Keep gats vocal
When cats act loco
Where you at when I'm movin? the crowd
You get trampled, mashed on Detroit style
Up out your seats
Pump out the E's
Off the beats, the crowd ""Obie, please""
Where my niggers at, smokin? them trees
Off the cognac, finger fuckin? a skeez
That's how it is when you party with me
You don't like it?
You L7 like a square be
Get loud motherfucker when I speak motherfucker
Out your seat motherfucker, I'ma reach motherfuckers
Shady Records ?til I sleep motherfucker
Obie Trice, nothin? but street, motherfucker
Tear this bitch up until you bleed motherfucker
I wouldn't give a fuck who you be, motherfucker
Punk, pussy, bitch or G, motherfucker
Adrenaline Rush before you leave, motherfucker
Yo, and since I came
I've rearranged the place with blaze
Stage dive with Colt Seavers, DNA
I'm so addicted to gettin? niggers lifted
Drunk off the liquid
O. Trice, the misfit
Dousin? the crowd with piss and bile
We underground, motherfucker, fix your frown
I be the boy with the whiskey toy
Off a whiskey
You never been to skeet before
So throw up your hands and
Peep out your man's when
I come through
Next quarter Trice intervene use
And trust, I'm attackin? it
I cook up the hot shit like Ainsley Harriet
That's why I'm so miraculous
And Obie gets you niggers pumped up
I'll see you next coliseum, chump
That's right, it's your Obie Trice fucked up
Off weed... E's and whiskey
Get loud motherfucker when I speak motherfucker
Out your seat motherfucker, I'ma reach motherfuckers
Shady Records ?til I sleep motherfucker
Obie Trice, nothin? but street, motherfucker
Tear this bitch up until you bleed motherfucker

It's shit like this I kick to these rich white kids
Who just might see how fucked up this sick life is
Ooops I did it again didn't I my shit's harder
To figure out than what Britney's tit size is
Oooh I probably pissed you off again didn't I bitch
So what Christina Gaguilera kiss my grits
You know how many shit's I get if I wish I did
So I can quit givin these twisted little kids ideas
This just in, Britney just dissed Justin
She just fucked Ben, got tit fucked and dick sucked him
If Afflec can get his ass licked, how I can't shit
Goddamn bitch I'm rich I can't understand this
Are those pictures they made of us together on the internet
As close as I'm ever gonna get to hittin it from the back
And shit when it comes to that I hit harder from the back
Than Everlast when he's pluggin Lethal in his fuckin ass
Just give me one more chance Britney hit me one more time
Let me know what's on your mind, Whitney give me one more line
To sniff, you fuckers know what time it is
Fuck your jewelery my record's almost dyin, BEEOTCH!
[HOOK 2X: Eminem + Dr Dre]
What's goin on in the world today
People fightin, feudin, lootin, it's okay
Let it go, let it flow, let the good times roll
Tell 'em Dre- It aint nuttin but music
[Bizarre]
Eminem doesn't like N'Sync, well I do
So fuck him, and the Backstreet Boys too
Whatever happened to the cast of Different Strokes
Mary's broke, Ty's snortin coke, and then an overdose
I got two little boys wit me
Michael Jackson sent two helicopters to get me
I'm up early wit my hair curly
Me and Mr. Furly, fuckin Laverne and Shirley!
[Kuniva]
Alotta rappers are livin in la la land
That's why I let my dogs out on the Baha men
As bad as a life I had, I'm not mad
I don't need to be a jackass to beat up my dad
My whole family's country, my grandmother's old fashioned
And she keeps askin me why I rap wit a honky
But grannie I'm a flunky I could be a junky
I could be hangin with the hoochies out at the club scene
[Kon Artis]
To all the independent women in the house! (HEY!)
Show us your tits and shut your motherfuckin mouth! (WHAT?!)
[Proof]
Robert Downey, Bobby Brownie, Whitney Houston
The shit's confusin (SNIFF!)
Jesse Jackson, reverend scandal
Got George Michael's, Tevin Campbells
PeeWee Herman's, peep show places
Public restrooms, peep those cases
[HOOK]
[Swifty McVay]
Huh, your mom and dad probably mad at us (for what)
We done turned their kids into little body snatchers
Aint like where I'm from, we don't bite our tongue
Are you sure you want niggas 21 to carry guns
It's sad but I'm glad that I'm made to rhyme
Where you work you aint gettin paid for that overtime
It's only music, media know it but they blind
I aint in your light, so stay they hell up outta mine
Y'all the reason why Princess Diana ended up dyin
If you people get offended I don't care (stop cryin)
Tryin to get us to leave cuz what we say just aint clean (uh, uh)
But holdin back on what I say just aint me
[Kon Artis]
Now what's these parents all mad for? (Your music is bad for 'um)
For teenage kids that drink more than Ted Danson in Cheers
Carson drink beers, we all fart and piss and cuss out our bitch (SHUTUP!)
Broke or rich, I still do that same old shit
I don't jump in front of a camera and change no shit
So when they ask me about my sarcasticness
I just slap 'em, turn around and ask 'em this

And when you act it up, that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up

You'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turnin in his grave
I don't know why they left you out in the dark
Ya need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park

[Eminem]
I'm the devil - if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gus)-ting
I'm (white), a human mutt, fuck a being
I'm a dog - fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walkin, talkin, ouija board
Speakin in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
.. Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norr ..
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo
""Is this some kind of sick joke?"" Shit no, motherfuckin schitzo
So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes
This verse was his urge to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
so-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So - lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn - here comes another ""Clockwork Orange""
Look at Bizarre; you really think he's right in his mind?
What the fuck you think's goin through it when he's writin his rhyme?
[Chorus: Eminem]
You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
[Bizarre]
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Pickin up transvestites on my Harley-Davidson (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
and take your bottles to the store (nigga I'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burnin, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jackin off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!)
I'm livin in Waco Texas, me and my girl
Fuck David Koresh, I'm startin my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetary, it's scary
Eatin a virgin's cherry, they're all gonna laugh at you Carey
[Chorus]
[Kon Artis with Eminem in parentheses]
I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth, I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, my right arm's
got more power than (?) Dragon's python so
""Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer""
(Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers, Michael Jack's ""Thriller""
Rifle slash knife faggot that's your ""Cop Killer"")
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was livin (aight)
Crossdressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
to be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you Bo Derek; I throw you face flat off the terrace
so you can have somethin to stare at

Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple (hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
and said, ""I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?""
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it
[Chorus (Eminem):]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
[Eminem]
I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of thai weed
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends
[Chorus: Eminem]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
for twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a minithin

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
""Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been""
""It's probably AIDS!"" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus

You have part one u got part two now its

The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
with midget arms and creamy white fillin in the middle
that will do anything to throw dirt on my name
if it means walkin the whole Mediterranean
isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
its Dave Raymon and oh, ho so sorry yo so sorry wo
but that was a long time ago when I was just joe shmoe
rappin in joe blows basement I apologized for it befo, so
either except it or you don't and lets move on
if I've shown that I've grown and get the bone
keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts
keep walkin around sniffin each others butts
or should I say asses

what would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
the question I ask is
how can I explain this
how can I swing this in English language
if I switch to slang and turn man to man
do I do it in vein or simply to entertain
am I bein real or am I bein fake
am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
or am I caught up in this hot water wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em? insult ya
I'm tell ya one me (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
but every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustratshin
or should I say or should I say shon
is it just another one of my subliminal was of racism
your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
like that of a man of seventy some years old
and it only gets colder which Is why I understand
and cant be mad at a forty four year old fan
with a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
and the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
papa cant stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money in his bank account
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell a partied loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but aint nobody over here buyin two white guys disguised as propalac
there is no slack
far heart for college grat. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
standin by the clearance coat rack
in some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
yeah
shady in the place to be c
and it takes what I got to rock the mic right

I dont know why this world keep turning
Round and Round
But I wish it would stop, and let me off right now
Yes man
As the World Turns
We all experience things in life
Trials and Tribulations
That we all must go through
When someone wants to test us
When someone tries our patience
[Eminem]
I hang with a bunch of hippies
and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches
and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts
Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source
They never should've booted me out of reform school
Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool
They threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my god its you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast (Who Me?)
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin (RARRRR!)
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming
Grabbed that bitch by her hair
Drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
Chorus
As the World Turns
These are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through
Day by day
[Eminem]
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsiders, and we suing the courts
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said  What up, its nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat ya to a faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt
But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So gimme all your money
And don't try nothin funny
Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to out run me
I went to grab my gun
Thats when her ass put it on me
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors
Started causin a scene
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank god I was smokin crack all day
And doped up off coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her
But so I gotta catch her first
Ran through Alleys, parkin lots and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in
And shot her fuckin porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room
Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!
You might as well come out now
She said  Come in, its unlocked!
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn
She said  Come her big boy, lets get acquainted
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg  No, please let go
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick
Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted  Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death (Ahh!! Ahhh!)
Come here bitch!
Come here!
Take this motherfuckin dick!
Bitch, come here!
Chorus to fade
And as we go along
Throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere
Every day
Every single day the world keeps turning
keeps turning

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my slinky go
Doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my slinky go
Doing, doing, doing
The way she moves she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to that new nelly jam, I
Think someones at the door
But I don't think I'm gonna answer
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing, doing, doing
What do you mean freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not till I'm finish peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing Mr. Officer
I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee, pee, pee
Yes, I make r&b, I sing song it go
Ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd
If I offend I'm sorry, please, please forgive
For I am Triumph, the puppet dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I sing, you will love it
[Chorus]
Jessica Simpson, looks oh so temptin'
Nick I ain't never seen an ass like that
Everytime I see that show on MTV my slinky goes
Doing, doing, doing
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they're getting older, they're starting to grow bum bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my pop corn
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing doing doing
What do you mean freeze?
Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put away my zipper zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm pee wee herman, this movies PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh cuz that is a puppet on my hand
[Chorus]
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year I'll say ass and she'll make my slinky go
Doing, doing, doing
The way she moves she dances like a go-go
In that video she sings get out your bozo
I need a new boyfriend, hi my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze""
Doing, doing, doing
What do you mean freeze?
My computers would be seized and my keys to my ranch
I just baked cookies Mr. Officer, looky, take a whiff of these
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word pee pee, pee
On the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast, I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kidd, I kidd
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

So Gwen Stefani, will you pee pee on me please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that

And I swear if you come back to me
I'll do things much differently

Couldn't we give it just one more try?

Attention all units, attention all units
We have an All Points Bulletin out on a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fella's
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
[Verse 1:]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm, look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually crack's jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs folks
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 2:]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protectors and be sure that you stand close
Watch each others backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys

I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 3:]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him mercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of the tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
""Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya""
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 4:]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider-webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place? went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
[Verse 5:]
Dealing with backstabber's there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin, then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen
Cut him at the seam then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
[Police voice:]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, how about that?
[Chorus:]
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Stay away from him he ain't no good!
I make you think you're a best friend then
Why I oughtta
Hit a bitch snake from the back, I make you think you're a best friend then

The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West [*BANG BANG, BANG*]
Ha ha, riiiiide..
[Dr. Dre]
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
[Eminem]
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
[Chorus:]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die

He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) [*imitating Slick Rick*]
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
[Eminem]
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
(Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin)
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
[Dr. Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a ""G Thang,""
and a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin""
I said ""It's Dre's Day,"" and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way
[Eminem]
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
[Chorus 2X]
Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West [*BANG BANG, BANG*]
Ha ha, riiiiide..

[intro]
[Cowboy]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop em
Quickest damn gun slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold blood
That ol' saloon there was their lil' home away from home
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da Five-Nine
[Eminem]
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head (AAHHH)
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said
[Royce]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, its like the Nazis in the nations
Collaborating, attemptin to take over the earth
[Eminem]
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vain
[Royce]
The disaster wit dreds
I'm Bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral
Serve this lobbyist, strangle your body then confirm you
Whippin human ass, throwin blows crackin jaws
Wit my fists wrapped in gause, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's
Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
From all of angles of us, flash a mack loud enough to cast a avalanche
And bust till volcanoes errupt
[interlude]
*phone rings*
Hello? (Billy) Aiyyo what's up (we're comin to get you)
STOP, THEY KNOW IT'S US!!
[Eminem]
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (uh-ah)
I'm the one who burned your house down (oh)
Well I'm out now (shit), and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
[Royce] (Eminem)
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel
(We'll be waitin) See you in hell
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel (bye bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what? (till next time)
[Cowboy]
And so that's the story when Bad Meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back comin out of that ol' saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?
[Footsteps and windblowing]

(Eminem) (aight)
(Em) guess what? i ain't coming in yet....
i'll come in a minute
(Em) ayo...this is my love song...it goes like this
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark
This is how we used to get the party start
We used to mix hen' with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in, you can hardly talk
and by the sixth gin you're probably crawl
and you'll be sick then and probably barf
and my prediction is you're probably fall
either in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everything spinning
you're beginnin' to think like a woman
are swimming in pink linen
again in the sink
then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wilin'
start a fight with the same guy that was smart-eyein' you
get in your car, start it,and start drivin'
over the island and cause a  forty-two-car pileup
earth calling pilot to copilot
looking for life on this planet,sir, no sigh of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
and i'm so high that i might dieif go by it
let me out of this place i'm outta place
i'm in outer spacei've just vanished without a trace
i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
i'll be back in an hour or so
Chorus:
'cause every time i go to try to leave
some geek keeps pullin' on my sleeve
i don't wanna, but i gotta stay
these drugs really got  a hold of me
'cause every time i try to tell them ""no""
they won't let me ever let them go
i'm a sucka, all i gotta say
these drugs really
got a hold of me
in third grade, all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube
seventeen years later i'm still as rude as jude
scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs
i've got no game
and every face looks the same
they've got no name
so i don't need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want, wherever i want, however i want
however, do show some respect to few
this ecstasy's got me standing next to you
getting sentimental as fuck spillin'guts to you
we just met
but i think i'm in love with you
but you're on it too
so you tell me you love me too
wkae up in the morninglike""yo, what the fuck we do?""
i gotta go,bitch
you know i've got stuff to do
'cause if i get caught cheatin',then i'm stuck with you
but in the long run
these drugsare probablygoing to catch upsooner or later
but fuck it, i'm on one
so let's enjoy
let the X destroy your spinal cord
so it's not a straight line no more
till we walk around looking like some windup dolls
shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
so bye for now, i'm going to try to find some more
Chorus
that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all,wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow you're probably going to want to do it again
what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?
screw it
and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
and what's a little fight?
tomorrow you'll be boys again
it's your life live it however you wanna
marijuana is everywhere
where was you brought up?
it don't matter as long as you get where you're going
'cause none of the shit is going to mean shit where we're going
they tell yu to stop, but you just sit there ignoring
even though you wake up feeling like shit every morning
but you're young
you've got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw
parties to crash
sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now, i wouldn't
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldn't
but i'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated
to better drugs and updated
but i've still got a lot of growing u to do
i've still got a whole lot of throwing up to spew
but when it's all said and done i'll be forty
before i know it with a fortyon the porch telling stories
with a bottle of  jack
two grandkids on my lap
baby-sitting for hailie while hailie is out smashed

Who shoots himself in the leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl

Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through

You went to Cranbrook that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangsta but his real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle he shook

This guy's a choke artist
You catch a bad 1,
Your better off shooting yourself with poppa doc's hand gun.
Climbing up this mountain, your weak,
I leave you lost without a paddle.
Floatin up shits creek.
You ain’t Detroit. I’m the D.
Your the new kid on the block
about to get smacked to the boondocks.
Fucking nazi your squad ain’t your type,
take some real advice
and form a group with Vanilla Ice.
And wut I tell you, you better use it.
This guys a hillbilly this ain’t Willie Nelson music.
Trailor trash, I’ll choke you to your last breath
and have you look foolish like cheddar bob when he shot himself.
Silly rabbit, I know why they call you that ...
cuz you follow future like he got carrotz up his ass crack.
And when you acted up
thats when you got jacked up
and act stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up.
I crack your shoulder blade
you’ll get dropped so hard that Elvis’ll start turning in his grave.
Now I know why they left you out in the dark.
You need to take your white ass
back across 8 mile to the trailor park.
[B Rabbit]
This guy raps like his parents jerked em.
He sounds like Erick Sermon ... the generic version.
This whole crowd looks suspicious
it’s all dudes in here except for these bitches.
So i'm a german eh?
Thats ok you look like a fucking worm with braids.
These leadaz of the freeworld rookies.
Lookie, how could 6 dicks be pussies?
Talking about shits creek bitch,
you could be up piss creek with paddles.
This deep. Your still gonna sink, your a discrace,
ya they call me rabbit this is a turtle race.
He can’t get with me spittin this shit wickedy
lyckety-shot a spika-a-spicketly split lyckety.
I’m gonna turn around with a great smile
and walk my white ass back across 8 mile.

Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through
Are you reaching out for me, like I'm reaching out for you?
I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump
But I need something to pull me out this dump,
I took my bruises, took my lumps
Fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up
In order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again
So I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent
But I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
I need a new outlet, I know some shit's so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room
Just as soon as I walk in
It's like all eyes on me
So I try to avoid any eye contact
'cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation
Like I want that... I'm not looking for extra attention
I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant
Trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack
And half of them ain't even funny like
""Ah, Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn""
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh They can all get fucked.
Just stay true to you so
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh They can all get fucked. Just stay true to you so
Nobody asked for life to deal us
With these bullshit hands we're dealt
We have to take these cards ourselves
And flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
And get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in
At every single place
Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign poll at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
Are you reaching out for me, I'm reaching out for you?
So oh oh
Yea... To my babies. Stay strong.
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, god gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
And be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

Every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid
Even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there
Holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign poll at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryna impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile
In each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens
Let's see if you can fit your feet
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone...
So are you calling me, are you trying to get through, oh?
Are you reaching out for me, I'm reaching out for you?
So oh oh
Yea... To my babies. Stay strong.
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, god gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
And be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny,
Don't ever let no one tell you, you ain't beautiful

how did i settle for a world in shades of gray?
when you go in cirlcles all the scenery looks the same
and you don't know why
then i looked into your eyes
where the road streched out in front of me and i realized
(chours)
i never lived before your love
i never fell before your touch
i never needed anyone to make me feel alive
but then again i wasnt really living
i never lived before your love
i wanted more than just an ordinary life
all of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky
i stand before you and my heart is in your hands
and i don't know how i survived without your kiss
casue your giving me a reason to exist

i never lived before your love

i never needed anyone to make me feel alive

And our asses'll both be history (AHH!!!)
But then again you finaly get your wish
Cause you'll be all over the street like 50 cent (Hahahahaha!)
Fucking punk, pussy, fuck you chump!
Give me a one-on-one see if I don't fuck you up!
Try to chump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track,
That's how much you suck dick in the industry
Swear that you in the streets hustling
You sit behind a fucking desk at the Source butt kissing
And begging muthafuckas for guest appearences
And you can't even get the clearances
Cause real lyricists dont even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we dont like you... we hate you period!
Talk about a midlife crisis, damn
Last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a busta? What the fuck's with that?!
Get on a track dissing us, kissing 50's ass
And askin' me what I know about indictments, bite me!
Bitch, I got 2 cases and probation, Fight me!
What do I know about standing in front of a judge, like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence hands
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of you the only thing you have in this world
a little girl
And I'll put that on her
When this is all over
I would never try to make her a star, and eat off her
I dunno shit about no shopping rocks
But what you know about hip-hop, shops, rocking spots
When your the only white boy up in that bitch just ripping
Pressing up your own flyers, and your stickers
Just sticking them bitches up after spending 6 hours at Kinkos
Making copies of your covers to cassette singles
To sell 'em out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole pay check at discmakers
What you know about being bullied over half your life
Oh thats right, you should know what thats like, your half-white
Vanilla ice, spill the beans and rice, I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If it's that much of a gangsta put the mic down
You should be out killing muthafuckas right now
Kill a muthafucka dead, kill him dead bitch
Shoot him in the fucking head, go ahead bitch
Slap my mom, slap the fuck out of her
She can't sue you, she wouldn't get a buck out of you
Cause your broke as fuck, you suck
Your a fucking joke , if u was really selling coke
Well then what the fuck you stop for dummy!
If you sleugh some crack
You'd make alot more money than you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what is like to be rich, life's a bitch ain't it

Why are you being so mean?
You're mean mean man
[Chorus]
You are just jealous of me
Cuz you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it
You walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things
About me cuz you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only cuz you're
Just really jealous of me
Cuz I'm what you want to be
So you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things
Cuz it's too easy to see
You're just a really big weenie, big weenie
[Verse 1]
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind-your eyes close them
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes
We are going to explore into your mind
To find out why you're so fuckin' jealous
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?
Hippity ga-ga boo-boo
Psych, I'm kidding
I just wanted to see if you're still listenin'
Ok, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question
Why do I always sense this undeniable tension
From the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever theres conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin' at me
Is it just because
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me
Is that I fucked up ain't it?
But I can bust one take without lookin' at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes
Or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, ok?
You're droolin, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting
What the fuck you eat for lunch
A bunch of sweets or something, what?
You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum
Your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on?
You sir are on chew syrum
Marshall I'm so jealous of you
Please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying
All these terrible, evil and awful mean things
It's my own insecurity!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cuz that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here?
Wait, let me put these sun glasses on
Now look in this mirror, how about now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball tweeked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortuous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, weenie will shrink
Now I fogot what the chorus is, your just is...

clockin 'em, stickin 'em, pokin 'em, clampin 'em
Who'd elect ya kids, indict their votes
Hit 'em with vicoden doses of lighting bolts
I'm zappin, ???
Faster than you can snap your fingers for answers
Cancer is in the flesh
Alight a breather
Survived it by the knife and the thievin?
VERSE 2
I had a dream I was gettin jacked by biters
It felt like I was being attacked by spiders
Developin' a fear from biterphobia
I'm holdin the gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya
I'ma pulverise disect ya brain
Diggin in ya skull for lies that I'm a torture
With material iller than a stark raid or mass serial killer
I'm more dangerous
Than a loaded chamber is
A major is to a plagiarist
So beware of the aura
A terror, the horror
Will scare ya tomorrow
Ze-ero?? assault for rappers
Hear the start of developin' skills
A head full of Porter
We run or gallop on hills???
The choice is yours
Decipher these noisy force minutes
Scream ?til my voice is hoarse
Cuz I'm sick of these debators
That grab like repertoires and saboteurs
And bite like Labradors
Hear the range of my double barrel
And your life is in danger troubled and perilled
VERSE 3
I can't understand flyers
Second?? with camp fires
Cuz vampires bite on my balls and clamp pliers
It's swinging my big thing-a-ma-jig
So I'm ringing my neck
Proof will backup
when I sing at my gig
Cuz biters are fallin head over heels
in love
With every rhyme that I set over ears
That's how I became paranoid
Chewing my fingernails
Pulling my hair annoyed

Welcome back, to the stage of history
[Eminem]
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle?  I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you,
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it
while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[J-Black]
Am I the worst?  Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God?  I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
Chorus 1/2
[Announcer]
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
[Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care
Chorus
[J-Black]
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
Haha..

Time's up!
You lose!

You're my Supastar, Im you're

I'm right in the spto, I've never
seen a girl like this but she's
hot, tanned skin long legs
right on top, now I'm
with a chick in the whip and
says stop, come on lets go
straight to the club.
[MELO-D]
Come on girl let me be your
Supastar, we can ride all day,
roof down in the car, then
stop off get a cold drink at a
bar, coz you look so fine and
you shine like a star, you had
a short white skirt and your
top cut low, smooth skin and
the wind would make your
hair blow, girl your flow was
so tight I just could'nt say no,
I said jump in the ride buckle
up and lets go.
[CHORUS]
Supastar, face from a movie
screen, supastar, like the
cover of a magazine, no

one fan by far, supastar.
[KRAZY]

precious than a golden prize,
everytime I see ya I'm
hypnotised, I'm your number
one fan you best realise.
[ROCKY B]
Jammin in a whip about
midday, in need of a chick
coz i just got played, then
I clocked dis chick walking
straight my way, a supastar
chick just like Beyonce,
she was carrying Gucci and
Prada bags, so then i thought
to myself let me help her out,
pulled over do you want a
ride, the answer was yes
how could she deny.

Mon cherie, don't you worry
about a thing, whether you

Niggaz is so gangsta, Niggaz is thugs
Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggaz came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cuz them niggaz just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggaz get behind mics and ain't even MC's
Niggaz get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughin all the way to the bank
Watchin the satellite from a Bentley
You niggaz don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissin
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissin
The media just feeds into these feuds
Tryin to add fuel to the fire. This little nigga, Ja Rule
Talking bout he's gonna slap me. Nigga please
You gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview em
All they doin is making fake threats to us through em
And pussy you're not Pac, I knew em
Pac was a real nigga, you just a fuckin insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passes
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whoopin your ass
You're talkin to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your ear? I don't even gotta say it, the

When I do pop pills I keep my tube socks filled.
And pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed.
Spit games to these hoes like a soap opera episode
Then punch a bitch in the nose 'till the whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches.
I'm that viscious to walk up and dropkick midgets
They call me ""Boogie Night"", a stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Comin' through the airport, sluggigh, walkin' on crutches
And hit a fuckin' pregnant bitch in the stomach with luggage
It's like a dream I can't back out, I black out,
I'm back out...lookin' for somebody up to beat the crap out

[Eminem]
These are the results of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts,  Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
(Whosssssh)  My first day in junior high, this kid said,
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was one twenty
I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?
He said,  Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse...
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first
Something told me,  Try to fake a stomach ache it works
I screamed,  Owww!  My appendix feels like they could burst!
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!
[N]  What's the matter?
[E]  I don't know, my leg, it hurts!
[N]  Leg?!?  I thought you said it was your tummy?!?

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was goin
But everywhere I go they keep playin my song
[Eminem]
Brain damage..
Way before my baby daughter Hailey
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him,  We shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said,  You gonna die honkey!
The principal walked in  (What's going on in here?)
and started helpin him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my orange juice,
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.
I'm gettin you back bully!  Now once and for good.
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..
.. Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screamin,  What are you on, drugs?!?
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!   (Sorry!)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed,  Look bitch, what have you done?!?
[M]  Oh my God, I'm sorry son
[E]  Shut up you cunt!   I said,  Fuck it!
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
Chorus

It's probably brain damage..

Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging
[Verse]
I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect
That's what he says to himself
As he uses magazines to trash me
As he sits with both feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cuz he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cuz it annoys him to see that I ain't scared

You aint no motherfucking (bully)
And I aint bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, aint gon coward to no (bully)

Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many motherfuckers that just are
They just keep pounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja' [laughter]
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
I dawg you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cuz you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
[Chorus]
You must be taking to much (E...)
[Verse]
Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Toungue, and Freaky Ta
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cuz I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halie's name

Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)

How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then

I'ma find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
Tellin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out tha game an'...
They see me more pop a boy for icey cuz I could
Shootin' guns for money you probably forgot your way around the hood
Bitch when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
Now you want it wit' us, half your artists got to make a point
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer picture
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nuttin' about what pain is sucka
I'll put your ass to the ground like a train conductor, muh'fucker
[50 Cent]
[Chorus]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me
[Tony Yayo]
Yeah nigga yeah

Cause we move units uhha
Don't think we ain't billin you for this motherfucking studio time

Put your mutha fuckin hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your mutha fuckin hands up...
Look, look
Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free Worlds got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
One, two, three-it, to the four
One pac, two pac, three pac, four
Four pac, three pac, two pac, one
Ya'll pacs, he's pacs, ya'll pacs... None
This guy ain't no mutha fuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailor with my mom
By boy future isn't Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named 'Cheddar Bob' (That's me!)
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped... By all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl...
I'm still standing here screaming 'Fuck the Free World'
Don't never try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But, I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook
That's a private school
What's the matter dawg, you embarrased?
This guy's a gangsta? His real names Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
Cuz there ain't no such things as half weight crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
In his fuckin' yearbook
FUCK CRANBROOK!!!
Fuck tha beat, I'll got a-capella
Fuck a Poppa Doc, fuck a clock
Fuck a trailor, Fuck, everybody
Fuck ya'll if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash. I'll say it proudly
And fuck this battle I don't wanna win... I'm out he
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me...

It's just like old times, the dynamic duo, two old friends, why panic, you already know who's
fully capable, the two capped heroes, dial straight down the center eight-zero-zero, you can
even call collect, the most feared duet, since me and Elton played career Russian Roulette, and
never even see me blink or get to bustin' a sweat, people steppin' over people just to rush to
the set, just to get to see an emcee who breathes so freely, ease over these beat's and be so
breezy, Jesus how can shit be so easy, how can one Chandra be so Levy, turn on these beats,
emcee's don't see me, believe me BET and MTV are gonna grieve, when we leave, dog fo' sheezy,

Uncle Marshall!
Will you tell us a bedtime story?
[regular voice]
Here we go...
Now once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper wood
So the silly little fans they were mislead
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
""Me and you, 'Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab the silver paint and let's paint my ass""
Hey mister, would ya care to bare witness to
The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister
Stanabis, little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the mister
Not havin' it, it's the mad sinister
Dr. Evil with his bag of tricks for
this little antagonist faggot dick-suckin'
Ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny fag Keniff-sta
You bastard I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canabis, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch
Now at first I ain't really understand the shit
Picture me for a second and imagine it
Chillin' in the Bat-Mansion and relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners
It's Can-i-bitch on some ""Stan Lives"" shit
It creeped me out at first. Man this is sick
For me, being just a sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters you were tellin' me shit
Like you respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter you ask how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me
The fourth letter: ""Slim, you really startin' to upset me!""
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter there's a bomb threat in our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me!
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit, that's not an ""E"" that's an ""A""
This dude wants to leave me a ""massage,"" he's gay!!
Right away I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre
We got a bogey! (Marshall I'm on the way)
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch
So in two seconds flat Dre's at my crib
The funny thing is we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
Shit. Oh Dre, wait a mintue that's it
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo boost
We can fly over the border ""Let's go"" [WOOSH!]
So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed
[BOOSH!] (What was that? Oh) Jermaine Dupri
Fuck It, keep goin' no time to waste
Wait, backup hit him one more time in case
Okay .. fuck now he's draggin' under the car
Oh well, only 30 more thousand miles
Meanwhile me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propaine'
""He couldn't have fell off that hard"" Ain't no way
""What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist""
Plus he raps with his regular voice [BOOSH! BOOSH!]
[BOOSH! BOOSH!] (What was that?) Pet Shop Boys
So we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin' but his ass was rotted
He kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figure if I stick him with a fork he's done
So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin', Christ
He won't die, this guy's like a battered wife
He's like Kim, he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back I cracked his jaw
Hold up, 'Bis quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest! Make my shoulders touch!
Do somethin'! At least one punchline
C'mon till the meter reads 9-9-9-
ty-nine percent of my fans are blonde
'Bis c'mon answer me man respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun rain moon and stars
Intergalatical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like Reservoir Dogs
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly the stub from a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's JD, this motherfucker won't die neither
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We stomped the bitch and then stopmed the bitch again
(Compton!) Detroit bitch! Talk some shit again!
Stomp him! (switch feet) Stomp him! (switch again!)
Dre alright he's dead dog, quit kickin him!
I think Stanabis jumped off the bridge again (Damn)
He disappeared yo he's gone he did it again
[Chorus]
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Where for art thou Can-i-bitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Can-i-bitch, oh Can-i-bitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York or just a janitor
From Canada? Oh Can-i-bitch

This is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it
Famed to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed
The minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it
Smell it
Started sniffin' it
And it became my cocaine
I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
Then it turned me (in) to a monster
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up
Like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no where for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in-between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3
Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet
A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic
And eight years later, I'm still at it
Divorce, re-married
A felon
A father
Sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke, and I can still walk
Chorus
So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I got a letter from a fan, that said
He's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason
It's been weighing on my mind heavy
'Cause I don't read every
Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals
I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you at least
A thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got
God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint
Man, boy's got to look
Nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now
On how
To describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get
Go ahead and bob to it
Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit
Chorus
So be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just
Come back on you ten-fold
I said
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just

when i realized everythin wasn't fine
I didn't want to live anymore,
i wanted to splatter my room with blood and gore.
Flunkin out of all my classes,
bullies beatin me up and breakin my glasses.
Parents abusin me,
my teachers sending me to therapy.
You see..i put on this happy mask,
So the people don't ask...
Why are you so sad?
i'm just tryin to help you..don't get mad.
Well fuck you..i don't need your shit
I don't need your help you fuckin Nitwit.
Well look what time it is,
Its time to do my biz
Well I guess this is my final good bye,
i guess this is the part where i die
i'll lie down on this bed
and blow off my fucking head
And you can pick up the pieces,
and send them to your nephews and nieces
and you pick up this bed sheet with the red stain,
and flush it right down the drain
chop up my body,
and this too you can flush down the potty
Cuz i'm leavin this earth,
its been a burden ever since my birth

I wished i could fly away,
Fly away from this life.

So maybe ,just maybe
I might fly away to some random place
One random day.

Its not these words are the giving,
But the life thats not worth living.
Just throw me down,treat me like dirt.
Its not as if i will ever excert.

Which blocked too much happiness,
From reaching hopeful people,
It seems im a body living lifeless.

I got out of bed at all.
I can't believe it's Christmas morning,
And there's no gift at all.
I thought that this was supposed to be,
A day to deck the halls.
But he forgot again,
And I'm so mad, I'm so mad.)
Chorus
A lump of coal I'm Wondering why,
I got out of bed at all.
I can't believe it's Christmas morning,
and there's no gift at all.
I thought that this was supposed to be,
A day to deck the halls.
But he forgot again,
and I'm so mad, I'm so mad.
Dear Santa,
I wrote but you ain't' brought me nuthin',
I sent you a whole gift list,
But I still hadn't got none.
I sent to letters back in autumn,
You must not have got em'.
There probably was a problem with the elf's up there or sumthin'.
Maybe them midgets didn't know that Christmas was coming.
But anyway, fuck it,
What's been up man how's your reindeer?
I put cookies on the roof for them to eat when they get here.
You missed my house this time,
That's OK, maybe next year.
Wake my ass up then and we'll have a light beer.
On my list was some things that I want you to bring me.
When you get a chance, please drop em' all down my chimney.
What I asked you for was playstation from Sony,
And Play-dough, and Lego's, and skates and a pony.
That's all I want, and this year I been good.
So please, fill up that sack and swing by my hood,
If you could, Truly yours, you're biggest fan,
This is Stan.
Chorus
Dear Santa,
I can't believe that you forgot me again.
Ain't shit sittin' underneath the tree in my den.
You didn't bring Play-dough or Lego's or Sony.
How am I supposed to get to school with no skates or a pony?
I saw you at the mall, singin' about with your choir,
When my friend called you fake, yo I called him a liar.
Now I'd like to grab your neck and set your beard on fire.
You know that song about the grandma who got run over, by the reindeer,
Who came down and landed right on her.
She got crushed on Christmas eve, now me and grandpa we believe.
That's kind' like this is, you coulda' made me believe too.
Now its too late, I'm about to convert to a Jew.
And all I wanted was a lousy gift under the tree.
But now I'm fucked up, cuz' you forgot me.
I love you Santa, we coulda' been together, think about it.
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
And when you dream, (Stanley) Mom I'll be down in a minute.
I hope you dream about elf's kicking you in the nuts,
And Frosty the snowman icing you up the but.
(Stanley!) Ok ma'. Santa I'll explain this real simple.
I'm going to see the rabbi, he's waitin' down at the temple.
Even circumcision can't be much worse that what I been through.
So next year at this time, send a filter fish.
Happy Hanukah Saint Dick,
Cuz' Stan's turning Jewish.
Chorus
Ho ho ho, Dear Stan,
I meant to write you sooner, but this year I been busy.
Santa Claus feel real bad he didn't come down your chimney.
Dangit all too, cuz you ain't been naughty, you been nice.
Guess Santa Claus checked his list once, but forgot to do twice.
Oh well, that's the way things go at the North Pole.
Sometimes hard to remember, Santa Claus gettin' old.
But what's this here about you becomin a Jew?
And cuttin' on your ding-dong, is that what they do?
Hold up right there, cuz that's sum crazy ass shit.
Santa Claus don't let nobody chop on his dick.
And what the hell you talkin' about us being together?
That type of thing there, that's for men who wear leather.
That's gay talk right there, that's H-O-M-O.
You sendin' this here letter from San Francisco?
(That's good. San Fran-sisco. That could keep me going right there.)
But anyways, oh what the hell, ohh yeah.
Don't be so gay, and about turnin' Jewish,
Call my lawyer say ""Orvet"".
Hang on in one more year, you got a gift comin'.
Santa Claus gonna' bring you a nice, blonde white woman.
And if Stan ain't to good, she'll look like Kate Hudson.
And that Kate Hudson, put her right up on lap,
And make all kind' sex, on his trouser shorts.(Mmm,Hmm)
Alright then I gotta go whippin' back on elf.
Marry Christmas Stan,
And don't play with yourself. Ho ho ho.

Where's my snare
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo
Verse #1
Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against
I have, I've been protested and demostrated against
Picket signs for my wickid rhymes, look at the times
Sick of this mind, of the mother fucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning, and taking names in the evening
Leaving with the taste of sour with viniger in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha probably sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now
Chorus x2
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
One More Time
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
Ha!
Verse #2
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailey, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I try to make it work
With her atleast for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'd of killed em, shit I would've shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show
Chorus x2
Verse #3
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to invision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
bitching that someone's always going through her purse when shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of munchasen syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it
Wasn't it the reason you made a CD for me, ma
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma
But guess what, your getting older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she wont even be at your funeral *hahaha*
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mum
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be

So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt

We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)

The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious
In a house full of dog shit,
I'ma gothic death project, you stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when
You ******* need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
****** I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on an
[Kuniva]
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphores I get yours across when I write
So emotions enough to say ""fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!""
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugs last night of his life
[Kon Artis]
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from runave
So get your gun and if you comin
[Chorus: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on an
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on an
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn an
Wake your arse up mother fuckers quit yawnin
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin
So up an sing along with the words to the song an
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in

You always thought that I was doing alright
But nothing that was through a night
But I'm crazy over you
Crazy Over you
Crazy Over you
Let me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu
[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac.
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You truly are the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy.
I go skitzo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat
The next I want sex.
You make me crazy,
the way we act like 2 maniacs in the sac
We fuck like 2 jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit.
Cuz the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us
We can't figure out if it's
Lust or it's love
What's sad is what's attracting us to each other
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother.
Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you.
But if there's one thing about you I admire its, baby,
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side.
Like a devil in disguise,
You're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devises
Out your personal vibrators and dildos
You fucked yourself so much
You barely feel those anymored
You're only 24 but you're plenty more
mature than those other little hoes
Who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy sexy cool, chillin
You play your position
You never step out of line
Even though I stayed in your business
You've always kept out of mine.
I wonder whats on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye
You ain't see a sign.
[with Chorus]
Or maybe you did Maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
[Chorus]
Crazy Over you
Crazy Over you
Let me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu
[Verse 2]
You're the ink to my paper
What my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber
The whole substance to my rap.
You are my reason for being
The meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you
I would never be able to spit the
sentences that i do but the irony
Is you rely on me as much
as I rely on you to inspire me like you do.
You provide me the lighterfluid to fuel my fire
You're my entire supply
Gas, the match, the igniter.
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face.
But I'm always going to make you feel
I don't need you as much as I really need you
So you don't use it to your advantage.
But you're essential to me
You're the air I breathe
I believe if you ever leave me
I'd probably have no reason to be.
You are the Kim to my Marshall
You're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem
The Alaine to my Hailey.
You are the word I am looking for when
I'm trying to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind.
You're like the pillar that props me up
The beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half,
The wife who never divorced me.
You're like the root to my evil
You let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you
Before you beat the shit out me.
[with Chorus]
And no matter how much
Too much is never enough
Maybe cuz we're crazy in loooove
[Chorus]
I'm Crazy Over you
Crazy Over you
Let me go crazy crazy Over youuuuuuuuu

my name is chikaChika Slim Shady
[Says] Excuse me?
Can I have the attention of the class, for one second?
Hi kids, do you like violence (yeah, yeah!)
wanna see me stick nine-inch nails
through each one of my eyelids.(uh-huh!)
Wanna copy me and do exactly like
i did try acid and get fucked up
worse than my life is (huh?)
My brain's dead weight I'm tryin
to get my head straight but i
can't figure out which Spice Girl
i wanna impregnate.
And Dr. Dre said (Slim Shady you
a base head) nuh-uh! (then why's
your face red, man you wasted)
Well since age twelve I felt like
I'm someone else cuz I hung my
original self from the top bunk
with a belt.
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela
Lee's tits off and smacked her so
hard I knocked her clothes
backwards like Kriss Kross.
I'll smoke a fat pound of grass
and fall on my ass faster than a
fat bitch who sat down too fast.
Come here slut (Shady wait a minute
that's my girl dog) I don't give a
fuck, God sent me to piss the world
off.
Chorus x2
My English teacher wanted to have sex in jr. high
the only problem was, my english teacher was a guy
I smacked him in his face wit an
eraser chased him wit a stapler and
stapled his nuts to a stack of paper.
Walked in a strip club, had my
jacket zipped up flashed the
bartender and stuck my dick in the
tip cup.
Extra-terrestrial runnin' over pedestrians,
rapin lesbians while they screamin
(let's just be friends).
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was
lied to I just found out my mom does
more dope than I do.
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous
rapper make a record about doin drugs
and name it after her.
You know you blew up wit the women
rush your stands and try to touch
your hands like some screamin Usher

So much beauty the road becomes my muse

Cool calm collected is the child that lies within, see

But somehow I miss it, I think I'll really miss it
One day
I turn up the radio and I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams I bring

Testing one, two, um... twelve

Can you hear me?
(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)
[Em]	Aight, ay turn my headphones up
(bust it bust it)

My favoite color is red, like the blood shed
from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin at my shishkabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(I can't stand white people!)
You thought I was livid, now I'm even more so
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe {*wolf whistle*}
I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show
(Yo can you sign this right here?)
I just remembered that I'm absent minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin every verse that I spit
cause I don't even remember the words to my shit (umm, one two)
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this
Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8X)
[Eminem]
Yo.. yo yo yo yo
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
and I was wavin it at everybody screamin, ""I suck""  (I SUCK!!!)
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
and yell out loud, ""All y'all get the hell out now""
Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem this is your record release party!)
I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket (I ain't got it all)
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
(ohhhhhhh)  And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
Cum on everybody -- get down tonight (8X)
[Eminem]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy {*wolf whistle*}
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like, ""Gee I don't know, he might be!""
I told em, ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monster (okay) peace out (bye!!)""
Then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick (*slurping*}
Made a couple of crank calls collect [*brrrrrrring, click*]
""Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?""
I wanna make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of

First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger

Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
[Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'

When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump

The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches

We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
[Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
[Eminem]
Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
50 cent, come on!
[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
[Eminem]
So nervous, ain't never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Yeah, haha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go! haha
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!
Oh shit, I almost forgot
You're comin' with me (gun shots)
Haha, bye bye!
See you in hell, fuckers.

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke - gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer - motherfucker say your prayers
Hail Mary full of grace.. smack the bitch in the face;
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face 
Off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money oh you got me mistaken honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like, ""The Vapors""
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho, the head honcho
Swift fist like Camacho, I got so
Much style I should be down wit the Stylistics
Make up to break up {*singing in background*} niggaz need to wake up
Smell the indonesia; beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins til amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits!
Her hittin the floor, and me hittin the clits!
Suckin on the tits! Had the hooker beggin for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly love; my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was ""Humpin Around"" and ""Jump-in Around""
Jacked her then I asked her who's the man; she said, ""B-I-G""

Trust it, my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave your toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the tech G
Disrespect me - my potency is deadly
I'm shootin babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hidin in a room; fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't push.. me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?

Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh

Look at what the fuck you dun got into
I see you found your nitch you're just a bitch with a menstral
Claiming you a murderer and spelt it wrong
You put the ""E"" before the ""D"" because that's all you on
You on Pac's dick (bitch) you a replica guy if he were still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry bitch keep it real life is more than imitating niggas and eating pills
And what kind of mothafucker ruins 3 deals that another nigga got you they didn't see

And Ja Rule be praying on his cover cause he need it
And you niggas hating shut your mouths
It's just the real niggas ain't buying that shit you put out

So Murda Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleased on a team who expects nothing less then RnB coming from that regime
Regime is a little extreme neck to neck with soldiers motherfucking marines
Ja sold his soul to sing we have witnessed teen on the TV screen chase the dream
Now that you embrace the green don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a muther fucking actor slash Pac impersonating rapper
Slash Billy Holiday how it happen
Artists with repituares saw him in action, Pac's assasination
Def jam grabbed him, told him reinact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy

A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyranasaurous
Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse

Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness yall ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats

But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust

Do I gotta get my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep

Def jam grabbed him, told him reinact him you'll go platinum
They seen it for sure I know that Afeni Shakur don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins
Reinacting her boy saw him click clacking his toy
Match and destroy Shady slash Aftermath in detroit motherfucker
[Eminem]
Doe Rae Me Fa So La Dee Da
Don't play me cause your washed up, lost your spot

Doe Rae Me cause we're hot and you're not
Going at me is the only shot you got
Ja quit playing now get off your not Tupac
You can get popped after all that shit you talk
[Kon Artis]
Now we can skip past the mean mugs, get to the slugs
To grievence and the crying and intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook,
You're half of a half-way crook nigga get off X dick go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one and when your gone you'll only be the late fake
one
Nigga please stick the script before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch, fucking old ass ignorant innocent looking senior
citizen
Built up slap you like renisanse sicitive wait a minute hold on
Is it me or do we look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch made man now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyranasaurous
Rex
You niggas can scream, holla and curse and go ahead and respond
Pull that pen and pad up out of your purse
[Proof]
Slim set an impulse to get at the wanktas
He told me to let loose and spit at the ganstas
What up gotti were in this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the drama for stucky and bush stones
What's wrong? didn't think were strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
This real witness yall ain't caught the concept
You're talking non sense to walking bomb threats
Contacts were blown by Benzetta in the Source
Threatning at the boss you're gonna see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerse to try serve on us
But Detroit niggas curve and they stirs to bust
[Kuniva]
Do I gotta get my nigga bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscience and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Caddillac, Pac or that transvestite that dress like a Lil Kim Fox
Your just like a little wind box when I press tight on the trigger of this glock
That's right on the little shit you got left to help you eat
You not Pac's songs without laws will help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying to mock pac your ""mock""avelli get your own identity

Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Bein underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate? I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatchin crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin for what, so I can blow up
marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up?
FUCK THAT, this the fuckin thanks I get
for tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
cause you seein more support than I'm seein my child
It's like..
[Eminem]
.. everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
without these cameras in our faces like animals
for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue
and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one
No bullet, you're so full of shit
this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude
over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit
Don't tell me bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch
[Eminem]
Cause you don't know me, I don't know you

This ain't business, this is personal BITCH
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very FUCKED UP day, I'm needin this fit
Shuttin motherfuckers up like they pleadin the 5th
Yo Em it's time to get serious with it (yeah)
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost my niggaz, relax yo'self
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreadin the wealth
To my niggaz who never seen it I mean it when I holla
at the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got, tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changin your channel, you played like a fuckin piano
Ridin slow through Cali like I'm ridin a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like, Tony Soprano, who do I trust now?
Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines just to get mine
Big behind bitches gettin dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
and turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
[Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
a front door with twelve locks
and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
and one in the chamber, gun in the waist
and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place
tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not
gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys
in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn
screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
so my address ends up on the internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them
that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters, blow it out of proportion
""Oh, now he's pullin guns on his

[50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me (and)
I need you to care for me (and)
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading, 'cause I know where I've been
Flows, bones, crushin', it's nothin'
I come up with somethin'
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinnin'
Haters hate that I'm winnin'
Man I've been hot from the beginnin'
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'
Once I squeeze the first shot (gun shot), you know I ain't stoppin'
Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, gun smokin', still locin'
what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling
[Chorus 2X: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge, so don't push me
I aim straight for your head, so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead, so don't push me
I got somethin' for your ass, keep thinkin' I'm pussy
[Lloyd Banks]
I cross my bigger nigga, and I didn't cry
To young to understand, the consequences of a man
Livin' a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas
'Cause they frontin' 20 years, of watching my mama's tears
Got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bomb, cause I need it
These niggas don't want me ballin', they want me buried
Thrown in the dirt, from shots flurry
Layin' your bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
'Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels, gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty killers got me flyin'
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm runnin' from nothin', my stomach is touchin'
What I'm clutchin', to give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder, so I'm bolder
And it's either soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
[Chorus 2X]
[Eminem]
These are my ideas
This is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I solved, with my balls, my ears
This is me, who's got to be
What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies
Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til they shot up bang
When you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'
I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'
Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin'
I'm a start layin' into these motherfuckering cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as man, bowing to his knees
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whao, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You want to see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fuckin' old farts,
A whole other side, I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow, little soft yellow
Punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause

This is how we used to make the party start
We used to...mix hen with bacardi dark

you have the right to remain violent and start wildin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eye'n ya
get in the car and start it and start drivin

Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this

All i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and
I'm so high that I might die if i go by it.
Let me out of this place I'm outta place,
I'm in in outter space, I've just
vanished without a trace.
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow,
I'll be back in an hour or so.
Cuz every time I go to try to leave (whoa-o-o)
someone keeps pullin on my sleeve (whoa-o-o)
I dont wanna but I gotta stay (whoa-o-o)
these drugs really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)
Cuz everytime I try ta tell 'em no (no-o-o)
they won't let me ever let 'em go (go-o-o)
I'm a sucker all I gotta say (whoa-o-o)
these drug's really gotta hold on me (whoa-o-o)
In third grade all I used to do, was sniff glue through a
tube and play rubixcube
Seventeen years later I'm as rude as jude
Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I got no game, and every face looks the same
they got no name, so i don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want,
whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want
However I do show some respect to few
This ecstacy has got me standin next to you
Gettin sentimental as fuck, spillin guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But your on it too, so you tell me you love me too,
Wake up in the morning like  What the fuck we do?
I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do, Cuz if
I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna
catch up sooner or later
But fuck it I'm on one, so let's enjoy,
let the ex destroy your spinal chord,
so it's not a straight line no more
So we walk around lookin like some wind-up dolls,
Shit stickin out of ourbacks like a dinosaur,
Shit, six hit's won't even get me high no more,
so bye for now, I'm gonna try
to find some more
Chorus
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it
and whats a little bit of alcohol poisoning? and whats a little fight,
tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Marajuana is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin
Cuz none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin
They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin,
even though you wake upfeelin like shit every mornin.
But you're young, you got a lot of drugs to do,
girls to screw, parties tocrash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now I wouldn't,
I woulda did more shit thatpeople said that I shouldnt
But I'm all grown up now,
and upgraded and graduated to better drugs and
updated
But I still gotta a lot of growin up to do,
I still gotta whole lot ofthrowin up to spew
But when it's all said and done
i'll be forty before i know it wit a 40 on
the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap,
babysitting for Hailie, while
Hailie's out gettin smashed.

you have the right to remain violent and start wildin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
get in the car and start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a 42 car pile up
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot, looking for life on this planet sir,
no sign of it all i could see is a bunch of smoke flyin and I'm

saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or
which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.
[Verse 1- Eminem]
Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to basement
And we can discuss statements thats made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me
You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
OK there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a past I call it hauling my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks
[Chorus x2]
So lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 2- Eminem]
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and Van Dyke
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
Thats about the time I first met Proof with Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne handing out some flyers, he was doing some talent shows
At Centerline High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys don't know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Chorus x2]
So lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 3- Eminem]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool till your man MC Shan came through
And said that Puma's The Brand 'cause the clan makes troops
It was rumors but man, god damn, they flew
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too
And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X-clan debut
Professor X vanglorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackers is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butter, we would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showing 'em off not knowing at all
We was being laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock we gonna have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the x clan's tape is...
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cause I rapped so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gonna say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a hoe

Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough steal from the real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Draw on the blank light
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.
(Chorus)
I'm a man
I'm a make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'm a never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.
Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'm going to be back for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.
(Chorus)
Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.
(Chorus)

Paul, 'the way you make me feel' with these calls
You should really take a look at the 'man in the mirror'
And tell him to 'beat it' because I 'won't stop till I get enough'
Do you 'remember the time' we were watching the 'Billy Jean' video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's 'black or white'
Because I 'can't stop loving him' and I hate plastic surgeons
And I hope they all fucking die!
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him but I can't
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit

Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were ""Bleep bleep"" and ""Curse curse""
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs
Yankin out my stitches, hollering ""Nurse nurse!""
""You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse!""
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And it's like that, and it's like that

Got no apathy
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift
That's right, to dear/deer, anelope, or owl
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout
You say I use my name too much as a clutch
Try holdin on to beat instead of pushin on your crutch
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you comin
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece, I be the sheppard
Causin the herd, the name is Ev absurd
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that

Skills prevail you possess, take no offense
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress

Welcome back, to the stage of history
[Eminem]
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you,
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it
while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
[Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
[Chorus 1/2]
[Announcer]
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
[Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care
[Chorus]
[J-Black]
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
Haha..

Time's up!
You lose!

When I do pop pills I keep my tube socks filled.
And pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed.
Spit games to these hoes like a soap opera episode
Then punch a bitch in the nose 'till the whole face explodes
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches.
I'm that viscious to walk up and dropkick midgets
They call me boogie night, ??? that walks awkward
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Walberg
Comin' thru the outpours, sluggigh, walkin' on crutches
And hit a fuckin' pregnant bitch in the stomach with luggage
It's like a dream I can't back out, I'm back out, I'm back out
Lookin' for somebody up to beat the crap out
I'm bringin' you rap singers two middle fingers
But if you walked to France they'd translate it to english
Then I'mon vanish from the face of this planet,
Then come back speakin' so much spanish, Pun can't even understand it

Obie the person who came up inverted
Cause of nervousness, that was soley the only verdict
It was worth it cause he changed, became so observant
Certain such of a purpose, if you knew him earlier
From the days its like a different version
So much hurtin' and pain, gave him game for certain
That's why its curtains and its murder if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these mothafuckas actin' tougher
Had enough of isolatin' myself in the room
Writin' poems and songs doin' the same at school
Now look what he became a fool
Cause he learned how to sustain his two
And noctain fame from you
Livin' hard but still Julliard, a God walks
And ain't spent a day in the pew
Reguardless of this, I draw visuals pictures when a ***** vents
So welcome to the art department
[Verse 2- Eminem]
I stimulate the brain, mimic emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinkin' its a fuckin' gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane, brain is on Venus, suck Uranus
Label me a genius, if you ever seen us you would say
He may seem as though he's plain normal
If you ever meet him, greet with a shake
See he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake for just being crazed
You part ways, your impression will have changed
You don't think he's strange, you'll turn around and tell him peace and thanks
And catch him flippin' you off with his pants off, hands around his scrotum
Tuckin' his fuckin' penis between his legs

Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha
[Chorus]
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
[Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad
[Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on what and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump
[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
[Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
[Eminem]
Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
50 cent, come on!
[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
[Eminem]
So nervous, ain't never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Yeah, haha
Still Aftermath, 2006
And don't worry about that Detox album
It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha
50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leavin', let's go! haha

when love moves from good to bad
wheels roll to a steely grave
crunching gravel on the way
where daffodils once lay
ringing bells of heavy clay
and the heart can hardly bear
the cold and loveless stare
from the eyes that once looked fair
and favourable to one
and the mouth a petal froze
like doorframes painted closed
and windows shut so tight,
cutting out the soft fresh light
The ending's never cried,
but a silent scream inside
makes it known that black is white
that the world is dead upside
that the love and joy before
is so much more than never more
it's forgotten, never was
an illusion, a dead loss
never mind the bitter-sweet
it's a bitter bitter sleep
where the mind can never rest
trying to work out what was best
you convince yourself it's right,
this love is stopped in flight,
surely you must be right, that day is
surely night
The ending's come again,
and poor heart, and again
and the lungs cry when oh when
will it end or it end
defending the beat so strong in the past,
the organ of love now deflating so fast,
pumping perhaps, but can it last?
How long did it last,
this affair of the mind and the bones
and the soul and the hair
and the never ending eyes,
willing everything to rise,
what hope now - the end of the affair,
more cruel because, the affair never was

For I know not what I've done
[Chorus]
Father please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off
(head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me, the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring, on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone elses lawn
(elses lawn, elses lawn, elses lawn)
Till somebody finally took me in, my great aunt, uncle Edna 'n Charles
(Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just dont understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?
[Chorus]
Predominantly, predominantly, everythings always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black
But what about me, where does that leave me
Well I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
What do I look like some kind of idi-wait a minute, shit, don't answer that
Why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit,
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again
Whining about his millions and his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
[Chorus]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these deamons
I never had any of this shit planned ma, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
This Santa Clause, why you not comin' this year again
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me cuz I'm in this ferris wheel
And all i wanna do is go to the mall and take hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe see doe now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring around the rosie, the shows over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please god, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
Till I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, myself is gone

Look, if you had, one shot; one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip, yo;
His palms are sweaty, knees weak arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd grows so loud he opens his mouth
But the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity, oh,
There goes rabbit he choked, he's so mad but he won't,
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it he knows,
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter he's dope,
He knows that but he's broke, he so stacked that he knows,
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rap city better go capture this moment
And hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music,
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
You better lose yourself in the music,
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
His souls escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward'a, new world ord'a, a normal life is boring
But superstardoms, close to post mortum
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads god only knows, he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo' he's cold product
They moved on to the next shmo' who flows he nose dove, and sold nada
So the soap opera's told it unfolds I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da da dum datta
You better lose yourself in the music,
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
You better lose yourself in the music,
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mother fuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed
I been chewed up, and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and step writin' the next cypher
You best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the, fact that
I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type'a
Life for my family 'cause man,
These goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer,
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin' on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot 'fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot,
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not
This maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music,
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
You better lose yourself in the music,
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a life-time, yo
You can do anything you set your mind to man.

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit, for these kids, to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know - that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass confusion
and drastic movement of people actin stupid
[Kon Artis]
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin like Boone's Farm
Hidin under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own moms
Connivin Kon, Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach screamin, ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk drivin a tank
Rollin over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street, 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music!
[Bizarre]
You know why my hands are so numb? (No)
Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't come (oh)
Smacked this whore for talkin crap (bitch)
So what if she's handicapped, the bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin hate you; I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song
Eatin a hot dog readin the Holy Qu'ran, while I'm on the john
Tired of wearin this yellow thong
Take it back Sisqo, you know where it belongs (thong th-thong thong)
Now here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck your love songs
[Chorus]
[Proof]
Just bring who you gon' bring on, who you gon' swing on?
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to king-dom come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen m-16's and one pump [click-clack]
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaw
Have you runnin out this fuckin club in your drawers
We lovin the broads, there's nothin to applaud
But fuck it it's all good, the hood is up in The Source
It's fight music
[Swifty McVay]
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again for swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back right in front of the priest sayin, ""You hear that?""
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers and made 'em drop his coffin
It's fight music!
[Kuniva]
These beads I'm swingin is stingin 'em
See all these niggaz? When I step in the club, I'm bringin 'em
If any nigga lookin too hard, we Rodney King'n 'em
Malice green to them and gasolinin 'em with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right hookin, right when your wife's lookin
Fuck fight music, bitch this is losin your life music!
[Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists
and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you nazis
Watch me, cause you thinkin you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me cause you're NOT me
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me
I came to save these new generations of babies
from parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy
to grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called..
[Chorus]
It's fight music!

(Erik Sermon)-  back...with the flyest material
(Eminem)-  Sh....Sh....Shady!
(Eminem)-  that...that.....that's me
(Mr. Eon)-  Iron Mic Trilogy
(Erik Sermon)-  back with the...funky...beats
Mr. Eon:
Packing the third eye rush you it's cyclopse
They trade in their high tops for night sized Withe rocks
Words in my right, they pass my left ear
It's solid decked out write the books for next year
Bear this grenade you got stuck like virgin
Who that cat splurgin' instead or rehearsin?
Tough guy, dj travi your high rise
Looking more like ronald then the fuckin fry guys
Go on uptown fucking senoritas
In Taco Bell screaming  vivas gorditas!  
Bring all your dogs i give em rabies
They never had a chance i might chew up all their babies
(Eminem: waaah!)
Pope John Paul the second, brain like satan
Have your beaten girlfriend cooking up bacon
I'm obituite with that shit that you hit
Slow my flick with ya cause mine to pick wit her
Eminem:
My nine is limpin ya six deep when i spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid air and four more on the way down
The eight straight strays to a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended, snapped out of your whip
And leave it un-attended before i whip out this gun and hit it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
Cause i can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snap the airbag, hit the corner and park it
You wanted a market, i got her tied up in a chair and gag
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cave-women, while i'm grave diggin' with Marilyn Man
Mr. Eon:
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit
Eminem:
And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'm gonna detach it
Mr. Eon:
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit
Eminem:
I'm flabergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a nap sack and latched it
Mr. Eon:
Yo,  Eon's whack now , how you dig that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were street rap
Get the greater rate with these rhymes i be totin'
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point when you stand up on your feet {you} best retreat
Let's go back in time and steal my whole seed
The quickening, did a ?briss? at the crispening
I'm exercisin', to uplifting the foot stage
This thing's the nicest, i keep telling you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you? 
(Eminem:  here buy this )
Eminem:
I'm ing you, at the wrong website
Mispelling you, break you and put the fear of hell in you
Escape above you, stuff the nurse in a purse
Disperse like i added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted virgin at birth {or  version of birth }
Driving off, leaving the murdered virgin at church
The first person searching the earth for the motherfucker 
That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first
You don't curse and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves
And if i don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
Then i'm takin' off both shoes and stickin' each middle toe up (fuck y'all!)
Mr. Eon:
If y'all got a bowl of hash better cash it
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit (Eminem:  gimmie that )
Eminem:
And if you're spitting whack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'm gonna detach it
Mr. Eon:
So if you got a bowl of has better cash it
Dollar signs flashin' i'ma take the last hit
Eminem:
I'm flabergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in a hatch-back and latched it

As we both break,
As the light stole in
She found me wide awake.
Wasted from a sleepless night
I reach to touch your hair,
Withdraw an empty hand
For you're no longer there
In between the silence, living is an empty space
Save the ticking of the clock
As the hands are sweeping past it's face
And I just don't wanna be lonely
(O no no)
Night and day
'Cos as I look around me I just feel that way
(Repeat chorus)
For you only
I turn my hand to something that will clear my head
But I cannot forget the parting words we shared
I open up my mind to all the pictures I can trace
But I cannot recall, the contours of your face
And though we slipped away
Before I had the chance to say,
If I did something wrong
Please tell me I'll accept the blame.
And I just don't wanna be lonely

Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I aint nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like a album
Who'da thought a country wide tour'd be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness

Just so I can make it rain all spring
Yall seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesnt
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasnt
Youre such a fucking loser
He didnt even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I cant even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever yall can have it back

Space jam Jordans
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you dont wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention

There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamian they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He aint had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
Theyve been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You cant put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin with a few true villains
Whose stand inside of the booth truth spillin
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths
Now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you doubted me hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
Im Hannibal Lecter so just in case youre thinking of saving face
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place

Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch call the cops
I'ma kill you and 'em loud ass muthafuckin barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still one found out right here
From here on out it's the chronic 2
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new
And i'm still loco and nuts to choke you to death with a charleston chew
Slim shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a mercedes benz with the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's

Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause i'm from the streets of
I told 'em all
All little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like i ain't got none
What you think i sold 'em all
Cause i stay well off
Now all i get is hate mail all day sayin' dre fell off
What, cause i been in the lab with a pen and a pad tryna get this damn label
Off
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap you can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that i was strapped with gats
When you were cuddled with cabbage patch

city
Where everybody is homeless or they
look homeless
I was drawn to the piers and they
looked to me like
Two beacons in a hurricane city
Under the bright lights that's where
it all began
I met the devil by the deep blue sea
And I watched from my truck
As you collapsed on the beach
I picked you up then helped you
to sleep
And when I looked back I was parked
there ""waiting""
What was I waiting for?
I was waiting for you
And as I watched you sleeping I had a strange thought
This is the beginning but the
beginning of what?
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
She recovered all right and we got
to talking
I ended up telling her how I felt
And Jesus Christ it was such a surpise
I was in love with one look in her eyes
Before she said one word, before
I heard her story
It didn't matter, I was hooked.
""I'm a junkie and a dealer, yeah I'm a tart
It's not smart I know, I cut men up
My mum says I'm the
black widow spider
Pull men into my web then fuck them up
At 15 my boy and I were walking home
one night
A drunk driver hit us, Mike was killed
outright
Had a row with the next one,
he roared off
He crashed into a bus, I was a flame
to his moth
I had a violent scene with my
long term man
He took drugs and OD'd,
so can you understand?
When my mother says I'm the black widow spider
Keep away from her, don't you ever get
beside her
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
I looked at her, she lived in such danger
But she walked into trouble, I knew I
could change her
So I bought her the heroin she needed
which kept her off the game
Then one of her druggy friends
asked me
To do the run to Spain
""You've got the perfect front
With your big fuck off truck""
Yeah, I had a lot of front and figured
I was due more good luck
For a truckful of smack they said
they'd give me 20 grand
I said yeah, but it's not the money
I need the H for Diane
I beat the customs and I beat the fear
But I had a lot of time to think
Bringing back the gear
I couldn't let those bastards kill
more Dianes
So first stop, the cops, I shopped the
whole gange
And would you believe it,
those cops paid me 40 grand
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
But we had to leave Brighton
There was a contract on his head
He said we'll get it together in the country
We headed for Wales.
He said we were living like lucky people
He bought us a semi with a cat
Ate TV dinners, watched a lot of soaps
He had so many, so many high hopes
Whereas I just hoped to be high
He tried to get me off the drugs,
on my case always
I'd never had so many boring holidays,
I didný appreciate it enough, then he complained,
I guess it's simple, I needed to see bright
lights again,
He was using his truck to carry spaghetti and pasta
But me, I needed a life that was a whole lot faster
Wanted to be back in Brighton
Wanted to feel like me
I loved him for what he'd done for me
But I wasn't in love anymore.
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
Yeah, it's like Harlan Howard says
She loved the Brighton lights more
than she loved me
She called them beautiful jewels, too
special to steal
They shone like the eyes of children
Or the lips of lovers
One night I came home and
she was gone
Where to, it didn't take me long
Though there was a contract out
on my life
I didn't give a fuck, I needed my wife
I found her alright, with a guy called Cat
She was hooked again in Brighton,
screamed she wouldn't come back
To cut a long story short,
That was That.
It's the last time I'll be driving round
the Steine
Round the fountains and the dark
shadowy green
I got some skag from a friend of Cat's
Swapped if for a house in Wales,
nice semi with a cat
Well I won't be needing it anymore
My wife has turned into a whore
I'm parked by the post-box,
in between the piers,
Where I first saw her
Where it all began
I drop the letter in the box,
and walk out on the beach
This time, it's me collapsed in a heap
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
The police got the tape and this is
what it said
By the time you get this, I'll be dead
You'll find me on the beach
where it all started
I'm doing this because of my wife
I love her dearly, but she doesn't
feel the same
I can't face life without her, and I
can't live with her
Not while she's like this
She was clean for 18 months when
we were together
But now she's back in this life
I spent 40 grand trying to
make her happy
But now the money's gone
And so has she.
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
That was two weeks ago,
cut me up bad.
I OD'd myself last weekend
I didn't want this sort of end
I just fell out of love with him
I wanted him to go, or to let me go
But he called me his wife, he was
obsessed
He'd fallen head over heels
in love with me
Just like the rest
(the way that they all do)
There's my new boyfriend
Isn't he beautiful, hey meet Jim
I guess in a year, if my mum's right
You'll be writing an epitaph for him.
Hold on to life
Hold on to life
Under the bright lights where it all began,
I met my devil by the deep blue sea
Freakin' Brighton, freakin' Brighton,
freakin' Brighton, freakin' Brighton

These three B-mice, breaking

Three blind mice

They're on the run
They want a life
Out in the sun
If you get in their way, they
will mow you down
These hip hop mice, they don't

These hop hip mice skipping
free as a lamb
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run

The men in the labs are now hunting

Like lambs to the slaughter they do
give a damn
They outwit the cops and they flee

What's little and talks big,
With midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle,
That'll do anything to throw dirt on my name,
If it means walking the whole Mediterranean,
Isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian,
No, it's Dave Raymond and oh,
Oh sorry, yo, so sorry, whoa
But that was a long time ago,
When I was just Joe Schmo,
Rapping in Joe Blow's basement,
I apologized for it before so,
Either accept it or you don't,
And let's move on,
If I ain't shown that I've grown you can get the bone,
Keep lickin these nuts you industry mutts,
Keep walking around sniffing each other's butts,
Or should I say asses,
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses,
The question I ask is how can I explain this,
How can I swing this in English language,
If I switched to slang and turned man to mane,
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain,
Am I being real or am I being fake,
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine,
Or am I caught up in this hot water,
Word on my daughter,
I told you That I love this culture,
Don't let 'em insult ya,
I'ma tell you once more again
This is the environment I was brought up in,
But every now and then,
I use my pen to get rid of some frustration,
Or should I say ?shun?,
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways erases em?,
Your face is numb, you're stunned,
You look is cold like that of a man that's 70 something years old,
And it only gets colder,
Which is why I understand,
You can't be mad at a 44 year old fan with a chip on his shoulder,
Who only owns a half of a magazine,
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again,
Only thing that makes them grin is to see me frown,
Papa can't stand me,
Papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down,
In his new chair that goes round and round,
That he bought from the money in his bank account,
That I get him every issue when the thing comes out,
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out,
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side,
Yellow par tied odd enough that he might slide,
He might find someone dumb enough that they might ride,
But ain't nobody over buying two white guys,
Disguised as pro-black,
There is no slack for a Hartford college grat in a fitted hat,
And a hunchback standin by the clearance coat rack,
In some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks,
Shady in the place to bc,
And it takes what I got to rock the mike,
Still not gonna cater these punks,
Fuckin cock-suckin, pussy-lipped, hated, mixed, cunts.

If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (Look!)
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The Bad and Evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever

I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were ""Bleep bleep"" and ""Curse curse""
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs
Yankin out my stitches, hollering ""Nurse nurse!""
""You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse!""
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And it's like that, and it's like that

Got no apathy
Yo I Platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy

The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout

Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you comin

Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that

Brighton male hip hop, yeah,
who'd want to go see 'em
Their crowds are sparse,
no-one can bear 'em
Their audience has to be dragged in
by a hearse
(poor fuckin' punters, please spare 'em)
They just love each other,
male Brighton hip hop crews
They scratch each other's backs,
and screw each others trews
Brighton male hip hop, nah,
I'm giving it a miss
Slipjam B is the death of kiss, the death
of life and all good stuff
You go there once, and think blimey
enough's enough
Where's the soul, where's the style,
where's originality?
But hey they're babies, they've still
got their virginality
Can they help but wank around with all
that bum fluff mucking up the sound
Non conformists, my arse, they're so
staid they make you weep
Boring after cliche, their lyrics make you
not only sleep
but wanna creep into a coffin jezus did these guys go to school
or did they just stay hom sick coughing, being coddled by their mamas,
'cause their command of language is
worse than Norfolk farmers
Ooh aarrhh, ooh aaarh eh, Brighton
male hip hop they got fuck all to say
(Thats right!)

Doin a box of doctrine, on stompin oxygen
? ? wit fork to your optic lens
Hittin wit a sudden force
Leave your boy layin in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuugle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double-deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
How you on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbin the steel, leapin over buildings that haven't been built

I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fuckin gas for thirty minutes this mornin
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change
I'm havin a bad day
My fuckin dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fuckin mad cuz I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam
I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer
I'm kickin this whole fuckin wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, tryin not to fall over
[Bizarre]
BLOAW BLOAW!
Shots in broad day
(BIZARRE, THAT'S YOUR MOM!)
The bitch shouldn't have been in the way
Me, Shady and Mike fuckin a hemaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin till late last night
High off a kite off of stick of sherm
Put your mother in a full-nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber tryin to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be comin up wit my money
Bizarre goes commerical? Nigga, you can forget it
B-- suck my *dick* that is the radio edit
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fuckin assholes
Battle me, you better go eat your vegetables
I'm iller than a Muslim eatin a pork hotdog in African festival
This shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane
Avoid the pain and fuck a bitch barely potty-trained

Mic check.. (My dick!)
Testing.. one, two (* Eminem hach-spits on mic *)
Ffff-fuck.. (My dick!) My nuts..
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people 
who ain't have shit to do with it, like Cool J does (My tattoo!)
You see me standin outside of your buildin; screamin, 
Puffy is good, (HEY!) but Slim Shady is for the children!  (WAIT!)
I look at my life in a new light -- fuck it
Give me two mics; I write songs for me -- fuck what you like
You're probably hear me rap half-hearted; cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryin to get my porno career started
Every place and event.. +Been There, Done That+
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went 
(* zipper sound *)  Come on, let's go!
Want a deal? Study these 5 chapters
Lesson One: Throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: Face em and diss em (whattup dog?)
Don't give em a demo; kidnap em (I want you to come with me)
and make em come to your basement and listen 
(you're gonna fuckin check this out)
Lesson Three: Get a job at a label; switch demos with Canibus 
and put yours on the owner's table (here listen!)
Lesson Four: 'Know you heard this before'
Hey let me get your number; I'll call you tomorrow, for sure!
Don't act like a fan -- you wanna get signed?
Get the Withest A R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as wack as you can
Lesson Five: Get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street; I ain't 
givin you shit bitch - don't even bother askin me (get away from me)
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spittin
cause I'm always shittin when I'm rappin like Master P (UNNNGGGGH!)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones, and stuffed it so far in her mouth
my balls broke both of her collarbones (OWW!)
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah ( It's all about me.. )
Gave Alyssa Milano syphillis, mono and gonorrhea ( You're a dick! )
And all three of my main girls said SEE-YA
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fuckin Aaliyah
(What? Oh my God!) I splish splash while I'm takin a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash -- fuckin your wife in the ass ( Oh! Ooh Shady! Oooh! )
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawnmower to cut the grass
So if I hurt your self-esteem 
and you get dissed too bad [Yo why you diss me?]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had [A big dick!]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad!
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad!  [Nurse! Nurse!]
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
What a wonderful day; I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renee! (Oh hi!) I was just about to toss a live grenade
in your driveway (WHAT?) and drive away (* car peels out *)
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood drippin from it, rippin your stomach like a paper mache
You talk a lotta shit, but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh (MOOOOO!)
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Wagin wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with +Agent Orange+
And wiped my ass with his page in Source (Here!)
The demon is here, steamin this year
I rip [*Mystikal's*] voicebox out, scream in his ear (AHHHHHH!)
It's not a gimmick bitch, it's an image I live it
Give a fuck? I don't know what a fuck is to give it
Yeah I don't think this guy is well..  I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
[* impersonating Method Man *]
I'll fuckin, I'll fuckin
Lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself
And bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back
And leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itchin to leave you disfigured and stiffer than Chris-topher
Reeves, I was teething with strep throat 
while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin a hammer and beatin your knees
and walkin through South Central L.A., bleedin in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip?) Wakin up the next day in breathin machines
Flashin back to being shot and repeatin the scenes
on how you just got smoked, and if you do live
You'll be too scared to tell it, like a Biggie and 'Pac joke
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
And when I rap about a fat bitch that you wished you had
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be sayin that to get you mad
I know that makes you real mad, don't it? (uh-huh)
That's right, Slim Shady (yup) Sway   Tech
Sprayin wreck (bitch)
And we don't give a heck (uh-uh)
or a damn.. or a fuck.. or a shit
So suck my motherfuckin dick

We got, ways and mean
The supreme dream team always up with the scheme
From hub caps to selling' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floating' on this cream
Who than hell want to stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Cease, dating' top divas
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a visa

Got five sides to me something' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Letting' bygone be bygone and so on and so on

Keeping' it retro-specie from the get go

Behind closed doors hitting' truths to the seafloor

Get applaud like a mandatory, cry yelling' ole

Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase you're finest is losing fast in the horse race
Two face, getting' defaced out, like Scar face
Throw your roll money let me put on my screw face

And I'm paranoid at the things I say
Wondering' what's the penalty from day to day
I'm hanging' out, partying with girls that never die
See I was picking' on the small fries, my campaign telling lies
I was just spreading' my love didn't know my love
Was the one holding' the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understood
Let's all together now, in the hood

To come up and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan, steady poppin them onions,
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixin to get into some shit just itchin to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mixin coke with coke and nut rum up
Yeah Yeah oh, what up, see my people throw shit up
See you talk that hoe shit now when you down you dont get up
And can't sit up your so slit up, the ambulance wont sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up

Song Name: Go to Sleep
Album:Cradle to the Grave OST
((Eminem))
I Ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breath till I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently...you just being hurt
This ain't gonna work for me, it just wouldn't be
Sufficient enough...cuz we...are just going to be...enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see...either of us
Coming to terms...well we can agree
There ain't gonna be
No reasoning, speaking with me
You speak on my seed, then me no speak ah Eng-less
So we going to beef, and keep on beefing unless
You gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you going to see
A deamon unleashed in me, that you never seen
And you going to see this ""gangsta"" pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need 15 of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you 'gon know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch show me..pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me you was going to do
That's what I thought
Your pitiful, I'm rid of you
All you, Ja You'll get it too
[chorus]
Now go to sleep bitch
Die, Motherfucker, die

Yous' no threat, who's ya servin'
When lyrically I'mma bury you beneath the dirt, when
You fucked with a label  overseein' the Earth
Shady motherfucker, O-Trice is birth
And as I mold, I become more cursed
So we can put down the verse
Take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse, is he who
Depicts fiction in this verse
And as I breathe and you be deceased
The world beieve, you decieve just to speak
Yous' not the streets, yous' the desk
Use not your chest, nigga, use your vest
Before two shoes you rest, you chose death
Six feet deep nigga, thats the depth
[chorus]
Now go to sleep bitch
Die, Motherfucker, die
Uh, times up bitch, close your eyes
Go to sleep bitch (what!)
Why are you still alive?

VERSE
i done filled my lungs up
with so much of this crack smoke
my necks bloated, my techs loaded,
im flat broke, and im pissed off,
mad at the world ive had it with girls
and im frustrated, ran to the bus stop ,
just made it and hopped on
ready to drop bombs on the first person who had a nice suit and a watch on
i spot JOHN a white collar worker
in clean cut, walked up to em
he was like what? whatchu mean what? you know what time it is man
at your next stop gimme that rolex watch with that diamond rist band.
got his green and his gold dashed it climbed in his van to steal it and seen
a man holdin a nine and then
shot him from the bottom up
stole his keys, put em inside the ignition and got em stuck,
hopped out to flee on my feet,
fucked around, forgot that i left my ID on the seat

Fed up with life and the way things are going,he decides to rob a liquor store.
(""I can't take this no more, I can't take it no more homes"")
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart.
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play...
(""Shit is mine, I gotta do this.. gotta do this"")[Dr. Dre]Alright, stop!
Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store
and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence  (But who are you?)
I'm your motherfuckin conscience[Eminem]That's nonsense!
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress, and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay
You'll be safe for days if you shave your legs with an aged razor blade(Dr. Dre)
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns(Eminem)
Fuck that!  Do that shit!  Shoot that bitch!
Can you afford to blow this shit?  Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?  Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?(Dr. Dre)
Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it!  (You're right!)
Not over this shit  (Stop!) Drop the biscuit  (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre?  I don't like your attitude..)
(announcer)Meet Stan, twenty-one years old.
After meeting a young girl at a rave party,
things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
Once again, his conscience comes into play...
Now listen to me, while you're kissin her cheek
and smearin her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe..
(Yo!  This girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, that's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush.. does it got hair?  Uh huh!
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)
No, but I seen the porno with SunDoobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail..
(announcer)Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker.
After coming home from a hard day's work,
he walks in the door of his trailer park home
to find his wife in bed with another man.
(Dr. Dre)Alright calm down, relax, start breathin..(Eminem)
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin
While you at work she's with some dude tryin to get off?!
FUCK slittin her throat, CUT THIS BITCH'S HEAD OFF!!!(Dr. Dre)
Wait!  What if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What?  She tripped?  Fell?  Landed on his dick?!)
Alright Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
Okay!  Thought about it, still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped DEE BARNES??!
What'chu say?  (What's wrong?   Didn't think I'd remember?)
I'ma kill you motherfucker![Eminem]Uhhh-aahh!  Temper temper!
Mr. Dre?  Mr. N.W.A.?Mr. AK comin' straight outta Compton y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that.. aw fuck it...
What am I sayin?  Shoot em both Grady, where's your gun at?

Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
You put 'e' before the 'd' cuz that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a regular guy

All you do is cry, bitch keep it real

Neck and necks with soldiers, muhfuckin' Marines

Weave eye-witness team on the tv screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams

Mash and destroy, Shady
Aftermath and Detroit muthafuckas
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Do-ra-me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me cuz you lost your boss's spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
Don't make me, too hot and you're not
Shootin' at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
[Verse 2]
[Kuniva]
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the greivance and the cryin' and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga you shook you half of a half-way crook, get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late greal one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script
before the guns stick to the clip, and Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on?
A bitch made man, now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a tyrannasaurus rex?
You niggaz can scream holler and curse
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta ya purse
[Proof]
Slim did it simple to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti and this little war you pushed on
But you ?? the ?? for sucking your ??
What's wrong? Didn't think we strong with real niggaz?
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business you ain't caught the concept
You talkin' nonsense to walk and find press
Contact was blown by Munsetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on ya porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But Detroit niggaz ?? and ain't scurred to bust
[Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugs, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconcious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils with dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind ya? Cadillic Pac or that transvestite who dress like a Lil Kim fox, her chest like a little windbox
press tight on the trigger of this glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video tryin mock Pac
You 'Mockaveli', get your own identity
[Chorus]
[Eminem overdubs chorus]
Yeah!
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again!
Fuckin' punk pussy little bitch!
I'll fuck you up boy!
Never! Never in your muthafuckin life!
I'll choke the shit outchu little muthafuckin bitch!
Hailie can whip your muthafuckin ass!
[Obie Trice speaking]
That's right muthafuckas
Shay records, whatchu know about it?
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this Obie Triceright here talkin to you muthafuckas
Ja Rule punk ass... Yea!
Fuckin Soul For Real ass...
Nigga that's Soul For Real,
That the nigga from Soul For Real!
Candy Rain ass nigga...
He got a deal now he rappin'
You'ont know what's... faggot ass muhfuckas
Get money to all my real niggas, man
Obie Trice, D12, G Unit, 50 Cent...

Yo, I can't sing it
I feel like singin
I wanna fuckin'sing
Cuz I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
Ha Ha
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out
[Verse 1 - Sung]
Some days I sit, starin'out the window
Watchin'this world pass me by
Sometimes I think theres nothin'to live for
I almost break down and cry
Somtimes I think I'm crazy
I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here, am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
[Chorus]
Somtimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin'on me
Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
[Verse 2 - Sung]
My baby girl [Hailie laughs] keeps gettin'older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cuz they don't understand me
They just dont see my real side
I act like shit don't phase me,
Inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby
Suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Rapped]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mum didn't want her
Now you probly get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packing drug-addict who bags on his momma,
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cuz there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside o' my soul,
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world
And I think my neck is breaking should I just give up,
Or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself,
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin'hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted are nothing to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what im facin:
3 felonies, 6 years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to peoples backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin, why'd I stick my penis up in?
Woulda ripped the pre-nup up if I'd seen what she was fuckin
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara, try tomorra, nice to know ya
My baby's travelled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems that my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get
The weight has been lifted
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin'on me
Cuz my baby know's that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me
[Outro - Spoken]
Woo!
I told you I can't sing.
Oh well, I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, daddy will be right there?
Well guess what?
Daddy's here.
And I ain't goin'nowhere baby
I love you! (kiss)

Welcome back, to the stage of history
[Eminem]
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle?  I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse 
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you 
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal 
I ain't tryin to shoot you, 
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass 
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it 
while I sit back and just hope it catches 
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[J-Black]
Am I the worst?  Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God?  I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
Chorus 1/2
[Announcer]
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
[Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care

Can we re- can we re-enact Biggie's song?
C-can you shit on me?
I just want you to shit on me
[Hook - Eminem (singing)]
Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend
If you toy with my motherfuckin' emotions
I'll kill you
Bitch I'm fuckin'
For real I'll make you suffer like I suffered
If you fuck me then I'll make you fall in love
[in the background of the hook]
Hey lady, hey lady
I don't think you really wanna be my girl
(be my girl, be my girl, be my girl)
Fuckin' with me can be dangerous (dangerous, dangerous)
You never know what I really (be like, be like)
(be like, be like, I'm your type)
(And might even get a little bit crazy)
[Obie Trice]
Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
And Magnums to lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a ho I abuse (yes)
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
When I fuck the shit out you, then the next date (bitch)
I rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
No, I'm in and out your home
And this in and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around (nah)
I bounce 'em around
Camcord the sex and sell 'em around town
How that sound?
If I was in love witcha, now you wanna clown
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown
Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nuttin' but what is you be
[Eminem]
I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV
So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth
And if you believe in that shit
Then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
But personally that actually works for me
Cuz the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'ma bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers
Cuz see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pad
And we end up back at that god damn tavern
And havin' another déjà vu, we seein' security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your news curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30 [gunshot]
[Hook - Eminem (singing)]
Hey lady, hey darlin', hey baby
I'm sorry but I can't be your boyfriend

See you lookin' at the life, you lookin' at the lights (lights)
You lookin' at the ice (ice) you ain't lookin' at the Trice (right)
You should look at some advice when I see he ain't nice (nope)
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type
O love to fight (uh) I love the drama (yeah)
Love when my bitch get to cussin' out Yolanda (fuck you bitch)
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swingin' her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe
Least I ain't deceieve and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can keep all your teeth
[Eminem]
What we do under the covers should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of ""Buzz's New Lovers""
And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors
Cuz the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed, assume just me and you've done it
And say that you was rubbered and show 'em the proof of it
But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to
Cuz you never know when the shoe
Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you
Cuz you think you want it then you want me, then you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked cuz you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life cuz if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you
You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?
Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
And have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never
Cuz we gonna be together forever
Right bitch? [gun cock]
Right bitch? [gun cock, shot]

with some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin Belle Isle Bridge
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed
with his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop
while my
sales
makin records break
Two and a half million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit 'em up!
[Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave., where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music, we got an uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut
[Swifty]
What the fuck?!  Is you stupid?
I choke Whitey Ford with his fuckin guitar cord
and
stuff
him in cardboard, chopped up in a box
with sixteen parts, I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we ""Hit 'Em Up"" like motherfuckin Tupac Shakur
[Eminem]
You a, ""Black Jesus,"" heart attack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country
{*laughing*}
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
{*needle drags, beat stops*}
Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise
I just believe in kickin a man while he's down
God damn!  I quit
Mention my daughter's name in a song again you fuckin punk

So i changed, huh
You got a phone,
Pick it up, call me
[Chorus:]
How come, we don't even talk no mo',
And you don't even call no mo',
We don't barely keep in touch at all,
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no mo',
And I heard it through the grape vine we been beefin' now,
After all the years we've been down,
Ain't no way, no how,
This bullshit can't be true,
We family, aint a damn thing change unless it's you
[Verse One]
We were so young,
So full of life and vivrance,
Side by side wherever you was ridin?, I went,
So close or most us some Bonnie and Clyde shit,
When Ronnie died you was right by my side,
With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes,
And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it,
You even had the same type of childhood I did,
Sometimes I just wanna know why,
Is it that you sur-came to yours,
And mine I survived it,
You ran the streets I nine to fived it,
We grew up, grew apart this time went by us,
Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises,
Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it,
Much as your pride tries to hide it,
You're cold your touch is just like ice,
And your eyes is the look of resentment,
I can sense it and I don't like it

[Verse Two]
It was my dream at first to be all spittin the verse,
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse,
So I came out I would'a killed a nigga first,
'Fore I let him disrespect me,
Or check me up with somethin' worse,
Some bitch that I wasn't with,
I would'a hit her to would'a quit,
But you were plain talkin' to her,
And tell her she was the shit,
I told you don't get involved with her,
You were smoking the cron'c with her,
Coming out'a the bar with her,
Stumblin' half drunk,
Like y'all husband or wife or somthin',
But me catchin' he fuckin' other nigga,
Must've hurt your pride or somthin',
'Cause you wolf I fit them after people,
Like you want it with me,
When all I tried to do is show you that your bitch was shifty,

You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you

The more it makes me wanna come back to you,
You say you hate me, I just love you more,
You don't want me, I just want you more,
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me,
I know it's sad but it's makin me happy,
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on,
Cuz you love me, and I love you more.
[Verse 1]
It's sick, but who could ever predict,
We'd be doin' the same shit,
We say we do it for our baby but we don't,
We do it for us, it's lust,
Cuz neither one of us trusts each other,
So we fuck 'til we bust,
Then we cuss each other, out,
We know what it's about,
Shout 'til I throw you out the house,
You throw me out the house,
I throw you on the couch,
Punch you in the mouth,
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother OUT,
And apologize after,
Laughter, pain, it's insane,
We're back in the same chapter again,
And it's sad but it's true,
When I'm layin' here with you,
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say ever do.

[Verse 2]
Cuz I hate you, do you hate me?
Good cuz you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry,
It makes me wanna just take you,
And just throw you on the bed,
And fuck you like I don't even know you,
You fuck other people, and I fuck other people,
You a slut but I'm equal, I'm a mutt,
We're both evil in our ways,
But neither one of us would ever admit it,
Cuz one of us would have one up on the other,
So forget it,
We can make accusations, people spread rumors,
But they ain't got proof,
'Til they do it's just the two of us,
It's you and me, cuz any chick can say that she's screwin' me,
But you gotta believe me to a degree,
Cuz if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin' it,
Yeah I would cuz the sex is too damn good,
If I ran who would I run to,
That would be this soft and warm,
So it's off and on, usually more off than on,
But at least we know that we share this common bond,
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on,
I hope, the only reason that I cope,
Is cuz of that fact,
And plus I can bust in that,
And that's why...
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I could never understand it,
That's why I don't try,
From junior high until we both die,
It's silly ho why must we try,
Is it really so rough,
That we must always call each other's billy goat's gruff,
Try to pull each other's legs,
Until the other begs,
We're liein' to ourselves,
That's the beauty of it yeah,
Cuz we truly love each other,
That's why we always fight,
And all we do is shove each other,
Every other fuckin' night,
And it's clear it ain't gonna change,
It's pent up rage,
We both have,
We both feel like we've been upstaged by someone else,
We've both been,
Someone else's someone else,
Problem is neither one wants help,
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed,
Our family's mixed up,
There's a baby sister in the mix,
And it hurts cuz the pieces to the puzzle don't fit,
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit,
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time,
On every song, every lyric, and every rhyme,
All the hoopla, all of the whoopdy whoop,
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopdy doo,
But I won't be made a fool of,
If this is true love,
You wouldn't do what,
You did last time,
You wouldn't screw up,
This time,
Cuz this time girl,
I'm tellin you what,
You do it again I'm fuckin you up,
No matter what...
[Bridge]
What you say, what you do,
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you,
No matter where you run, I'll be right there,
Right behind you, in your nightmares,
All the flowers, and the candy,
All the times that you threw it back at me,
You say you hate me, you gon' hate me more,
When you find out, can't escape me whore.

I'm having a relapse
How the hell did he manage
To get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail
Man, what the hell is his problem?
Well to be honest the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They compelled me
To kill this elderly man
And i get these panic attacks
Pop a xanax, relax
Try to stick my fucking dick
Inside a mannequins ass
Then i get manic depressed
And the orthodontist get gas masked
Kick ass
The first thing i'll put on is the mask
Speaking of masks, man
It aint to late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face
So you can see the things you face
And slice you up
And cook you after your murder
By strangulation
Thats bacon souffle
You making aint you
Well thank you jason
There goes one more coma
Due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more soma
And i'll be done for it mama
Go in the damn broom closet
Another valium lost it
Shovin the vacuums nozzle
Down the bathroom faucet
It seems like every day i get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that 18 month old baby
To shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his trachea
Breaking his neck in 80 some places
Baby here shady comes lady
He's got the razor ba-blades and the cha-cha-chainsaw-saw baby
You b-b-blundering bumbling m-m-mumbling dumm dumms
Yeah, here i come come you hear the rumbling, vrum vrum
Theres something inside of that blue tarp
And that drum drum
A head and torso of someone
Where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to
Maybe that girl with the long blond hair
Who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom poms
Clearly theres some'n wrong
'Cause she didn't come home
Shes missing
Where is she
Something fishy is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on
To my damn song
C'mon

you heard
I'm not being nasty now don't you say a word
I'm not being nasty 'bout the girl
next door
I'm not being nasty when I say she's a hmmmmmm
I'm not being nasty 'bout Eminemmylou
But she strikes me she's big-headed too
I'm not being nasty all the men that she sees
What can you expect from her
pedigrees
I'm not being nasty but when you know
about her bro
They say he's a pimp and the cousin is a ho
And the mother steals from the
corner stall
And the sister well she's a big mouth
and all
I'm not being nasty here you should hear
the things she said
All that swearing has affected her head
I'm not being nasty but she's been
sacked from her job
What can you expect when her
father's in the mob
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
Do I care what you really think?
You're a critic you think everybody stinks
You say mean things and you wrap em up nice
Expect us to listen and to pass it on twice

So What (bout what you say)
So What (youýe a liar anyway)
So What (talk to the hand cause

So What !!!!!!!!!!

a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty but what about
her health
It's just not surprising she's left
on the shelf
I'm not being nasty but she's
got no pride
She couldn't lift a finger
even if she tried
Her house is a right mess, and I
do confess
There's grime in her kitchen and
slime I would guess
I'm sure that her food is not very tasty
But I swear to you I'm not being nasty
I'm not being nasty but she's
no spring chicken
And her old handbag I wouldn't
be sick in
I'm not being nasty,
I don't like saying slapper
But look what the cat's dragged
in, a she-rapper
I'm not being nasty have you
ever heard
Have I in my life ever said a bad word
I'm not being nasty I don't know
what it means
But your reputation doesn't mean a
hill of beans
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're

I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
I'm not being nasty here but you're
a fuckin' liar
Well she needn't have taken it like that
I was only saying I'm not being nasty...
But she doesn't dress very nice
And I'm sure I saw head lice
SO WHAT!
And she also raps in an American
accent!!!

May I have your attention please,
may I have your attention please,
will the real slim shady please stand up,
I repeat will the real slim shady please stand up
.....we're gonna have a problem here.........
(Verse 1)
Ya'll act like you never seen a white person before
jaws all on the floor
like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door
and started whoopin her ass worse than before
they first were divorced
throwing her over furniture (aaaaaah)
It's the return of the...
""awww..wait, no wait, you're kidding,
he didn't just say what I think he did,
did he?""
and Dr. Dre said...
nothing you idiots, Dr Dre's dead
he's locked in my basement
feminist women love eminem
chicka chicka chicka slim shady,
""I'm sick of him, look it him
walkin around, grabbin his you know what
flippin' to you know who""
""yeah, but he's so cute though""
yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
but no worse than what's goin on in your parents bedroom (eheheheh)
sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose
but can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, My bum is on your lips
and if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
and that's the message that we deliver to little kids
and expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
by the time they hit 4th grade
they got the discovery channel, dont they?
we ain't nothing but mammals
well, some of us cannibals
who cut other people open like antelopes
but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
but if you feel like I feel, I got the antedote
women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes........
(Chorus)
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
(Verse 2)
Will Smith don't got to cuss in his raps to sell records
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too
you think I give a damn about a granny
half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""but slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird""
why? so you guys can just lie to get me here
so you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
bullshit,Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs,
so I can sit next to Carson Daily and Fred Durst
and hear em argue over who she gave head to first
little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
""yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
and show the whole world how you gave eminem VD (aaaaaah)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
all you do is annoy me
so I have been sent here to destroy you
and there's a million of us just like me
who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
and just might be the next best thing, but not quite me......
(Chorus)
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
(Verse 3)
I'm like a head trip to listen to
cause I'm only giving you things
you joke about with your friends inside you livin' room
the only difference is I got the balls to say it
in front of ya'll and I don't gotta be false or sugar coated at all
I just get on the mike and spit it
and whether you like to admit it (riiip)
I just shitted it better than 90% you rappers out there
then you wonder how can
kids eat up these albums like vaccums
it's funny,cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
pinching nurses asses while I'm jackin off with jergen's
and I'm jerkin' but this whole bag of viagra isn't working
in every single person there's a slim shady lurkin
he could be workin at burger king, spittin on your onion rings
or in the parking lot, circling, screamin I dont give a fuck
with his windows down and his system up
so will the real shady please stand up
and put 1 of those fingers on each hand up
and be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
and 1 more time, loud as you can, how does it go? ...........
(Chorus)
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
all you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
so wont the real Slim Shady please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up
(Talking)
haha guess there's a slim shady in all of us........
fuck it let's all stand up

Where's my snare?
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go
Yeah
Yo yo
Verse #1
Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against?
I have, I've been protested and demostrated against
Picket signs for my wickid rhymes, look at the times
Sick as the mind, of the mother fucking kid that's behind
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans exploding
Tempers flaring from parents just blow em off and keep going
Not taking nothing from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathing
Keep kicking ass in the morning, and taking names in the evening
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now
Chorus x2
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
One More Time
I'm sorry mama
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant make you cry
But tonight, I'm cleaning out my closet
Ha!
Verse #2
I got some skeletons in my closet
And I dont know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'ma expose it, I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't, on second thought I just fucking wished he would die
I look at Hailey, and I couldn't picture leaving her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grin my teeth and I try to make it work
With her atleast for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'd of killed em, shit I would've shot Kim and him both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Eminem show
Chorus x2
Verse #3
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision
Witnessing your mama popping prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitching that someone's always going through her purse when shit's missing
Going through public housing systems, victim of munchhausen syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma?
But guess what, your getting older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney
And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her, she wont even be at your funeral *hahaha*
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong
Bitch, do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mum
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit!
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be
Chorus x2

Check Check, 1,2 , 1,2 1,2(it's rolling)
Yea yea yea Dr. Dre up in here Y'all know what this is.
Its what y'all been waiting for Funk Master Flex, Big Kap,
Def Jam Records giving it to you baby.
Yo Eminem show these mother fuckers what time it is baby
[Eminem]
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit
Now if i only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet
Out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate the straight jacket it aint latching, and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation? (Come on!)
Anyway I got down with Dre (What up?) 
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, ""Fuck the Police""
When you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth
(Fucking baby) Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public
Suck my dick, bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't
Cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative
(Wanna Fight?) I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady
Dr Dre: Dr Dre!
Eminem: I'm drunk pass the tec
[Eminem And Dr. Dre ]
Cause if I get locked up tonite!
Then I might not come home tonite!
[Dre] Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On
Cause if I get locked up tonite!
Then I might not come home tonite!
[Dre] Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On
[Eminem]
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron (AHH!)
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake
Dont get so bent out of shape 
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me
Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove (Hello, where you at?)
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth
And shove his head in the fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the Withe kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent
Either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old
[Eminem And Dr. Dre ]
Cause if I get locked up tonite!
Then I might not come home tonite!
[Dre] Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On
Cause if I get locked up tonite!
Then I might not come home tonite!
[Dre] Keep it moving! Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is On
[Dr. Dre]
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do (echo)

What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle
put in front of your optical to slow you down
And everytime you think you gotten past it
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities
and disguises, to hide they true colors
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and mini-thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing YOUR shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin off
I'm tired of jobs startin off at five fifty an hour
then this boss wanders why I'm smartin off
I'm tired of being fired everytime I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathing down my neck driving me bezerk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working in Building Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have it on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
in the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
I'm tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin half the skill as me
saying they wasn't feeling me on ""Nobody's As Ill As Me""
I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of J-L-B saying ""Where Hip-Hop Lives""
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How'm I 'sposed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
Know what I'm sayin?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
Know what I'm sayin?  Right now I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin?
But ey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin?
Just fed up
That's my word

i need a girl in shrubs so,
come fill up my mug before my fag gets stuffed
when i pull up out front you see me Vauxaull Nova
when i hit the bar it's 10 past before im over
i came to watch the game 'cos im a blackburn rover
and i munch on eminem's while i'm down and smurred over
but homie, nothings changed, cash down, bottoms up and

my mates drag me through my chair before the end of the song
if the roofs on fire someone dial 999
and if you want to get drunk luv, it isn't a crime

One time for your mother fucking mind, we represent the 313
You know what I'm saying?, cause they don't know shit about this
For the 9-6
[Verse 1:]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin, cause they be actin maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks spun
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into you spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
With some ex rappers till their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smoke
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite
[Chorus:]
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
[Verse 2:]
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil bands
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the only one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases plastic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite
[Chorus:]
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
[Verse 3:]
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is speacialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical at a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather led a tactful, tractical, track for your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite
[Chorus:]
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...

The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)
Green Lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)
[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!

Whoa, here we go, I shoulda' known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
""Stomping in my Air Force Ones""
But you won't be able to tell
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the
Jigga-Ja-Jigga
Wit a small pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy
[Chorus: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50,
We the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50,
We gon' kill your fuckin' label fa' sho!

Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months [gun cocked]
[Outro]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do and we see y'all
We just gon' sit back for a minute

Chorus: It's a broke day but everything is ok  (It's ok)
I'm up all night, but everything is alright  (It's alright)
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep  (I can't sleep)
It's a long year pretending I belong here  (Belong here)

Verse 1: Eminem
One day I plan to be a family man happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Till I'm glad to be buried
And leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed
My hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up, the minute shit hits the fan it erupts
I'm anteing up double or nothing, I've been trouble enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, till I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf, Q

Verse 2: Eminem
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Everyday in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep
Praying for sleep
Dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts
With the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal
For these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Trying to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's trying to learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static, children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm trying to do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth

I'm not singing, phone keep ringing so I make up a rhyme
I'm not bragging, people nagging, 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearing what I'm wearing, I think they're going too far
A girl named Carol follows Darryl every gig we play
Then he dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jocking Jay
I ain't lying, girls be crying, 'cause we're on TV
They even bother my poor father, 'cause he's down with me

We are not dumb, we don't use drugs, but you assume on your own

In the 6 double 0 bumpin Isley

put me up on the hill to my condo
Told me she would keep it all on the low-low
But I told her ""Botchy, I don't really know though""
she got close up to me... she started gettin deep
she had me in a zone when she started to show me things
I never saw before

I knew that she was slick

Had to roll all the windows down
Isley and I'm thinkin bout the sheets now
Wonderin should I really take it there now

thinkin, how many times have I heard this
Kinda funny, but I wasn't even nervous
All her slick ass lines were kinda workin
I felt my knees get weak...her body was callin me
Just couldn't take the heat
Anyway it was 2 or 3, I gotta get out to the streets
Baby was cool but I knew it was game
she was to smooth be screamin my name
Even though we made the best of it
I still told her this....

Jealous! (8X)
[Girls voice: (Talking over the singing)]
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he got with some ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes, He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes, Nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, What do I got to be jealous for?
He ain't gonna make it no where, he ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...
[Verse 1:]
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only grovel only irrelevant issues
To many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company now you always bugging me
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'ma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
[Chorus: Men Singing]
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X)
[Women's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money
Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy
[Verse 2:]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga**
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target, you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife
He goes, ""You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now""
Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...
[Chorus: Men Singing]
Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (12X)

to fight for your country will you fight
or will you go down with no honor
oh his palms are sweaty

While looken at the flag

snap back to reality op there goes everybody
they now there whole life is on the line

"213","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/joe_nicholsthe_impossible-lyrics-141838.html","eminem","Joe Nichols-the Impossible ","My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
He could lift me with one arm
Way up over top of his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
And never even flinched
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate
The impossible
Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again
But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say:
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate
The impossible
So don't tell me that it's over
Don't give up on you and me
Cuz there's no such thing as hopeless
If you believe:
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate
The impossible

"215","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/just_dont_give_a_fuck-lyrics-10573.html","eminem","Just Don't Give A Fuck ","Intro: Frogg
Whoah!
A get your hands in the air, and get to clappin 'em
and like, back and forth because ah
this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
Verse One: Eminem
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman
Chorus:
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Verse Two: Eminem
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
Chorus
Verse Three: Eminem
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
Chorus
Outro: Eminem
Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..
Young Zee..

Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley...
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldnt remember it cuz I was Infinite
And I met ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicits and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said “I like youâ€?..and then he walked up and said â€?let me snake bite

And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe...
Gave him a elbow...Ayo Proof ...go....

When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it

[Eminem]

We stopped rappin (Oh it's Clappin)
Gun clappin...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit a accent
A french accent Excuse my french but

[Proof]
Bonjuor...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my...

Baby your da-da loves you (hey)
And I'ma always be here for you (hey) no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama?  She's takin a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell (whew!) da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it (no!)
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she?  We'll let her wash off in the water
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?

See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell
A place called prison and a place called jail
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya?  (Nah)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out (WAHH!)
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night?  Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make goo-goo ca-ca?  Da-da change your dia-dee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water

Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway

Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock?  (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE!  (whoooooshhhhh)

No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother

When I was just a little baby boy,
my momma used to tell me these crazy things.
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me.
But then I got a little bit older and I realized,
she was the crazy one.
But there was nothin’ I could do or say to try to change her,
cuz that's just the way she was.
They said I can't rap about bein’ broke no more.
They aint say I can't rap about coke no more.
(AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
‘till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
(AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinkin’ I'm playin’
Thinkin’ I'm sayin’ this shit cuz I'm thinkin’ it just to be sayin’ it
(AHHH!) Put your hands down BITCH, I ain't gon' shoot you.
I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you
(AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causin’ too much chaos
Just bend over and take it slut, okay Ma?
“Oh, now he's rapin’ his own mother, abusing a whore,
snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You goddamn right BITCH, and now it's too late,
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states.
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain Vicodin, vrinnn Vrinnn, VRINNN! {*chainsaw revs up*}
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin’ from his neck, while his head barely hangs on.
Blood, guts, guns, cuts.
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts.
Chorus: Eminem
Bitch I'ma kill you!  You don't wanna fuck with me.
Girls neither- you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef.
We ain't gon' never stop beefin’ I don't squash the beef.
You better kill me? I'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin’ off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said.
But when they kill me - I'm bringin’ the world with me.
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin’ but a girl to me.
..I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady, (‘cause why?)
‘Cause Shady, will fuckin’ kill you. (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady, (why naht?)
Cuz Shady, will fuckin’ kill you
[Eminem]
Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin’ to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added.
WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? NO! Eminem'll assault.
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, THEN, if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin’ out of somethin’ up in the 10th
(Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus.
I ain't even drugged you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in the tub but that's normal ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin’ murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine,
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in.
Chorus (first line starts  Or I'ma kill you! )
[Eminem]
Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause ladies’ screams keep creepin’ in Shady's dreams.
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
these eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!
TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cuz their ratings stink?
FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer,
from fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her.
From principal, to the student body, and counselor,
from in-school, to before school, to out of school.
I don't even believe in breathin’, I'm leavin’ air in your lungs
just to hear you keep screamin’ for me to seep it.
OKAY, I'M READY TO GO PLAY
I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.
I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS sag
You faggots keep eggin’ me on ‘till I have you at knifepoint,
then you beg
me to stop?
SHUT UP! Gimme your hands and feet!
I said SHUT UP when I'm talkin to you!
YOU HEAR ME? ANSWER ME!
Chorus (first line starts  Or I'ma kill you!
ninth line starts  Bitch I'ma kill you! )

Too bad, bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like all right
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!

And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie

This guy's a choke artist
Ya catch a bad one
Your better off shootin yourself
With Papa Doc's handgun
Climbin up this mountain your weak
Ill leave you lost without a paddle
Floatin shits creek
You ain't Detroit, Im the D
Your the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boonedocks
Fuckin Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailor trash, Ill choke you to your last breath
And have you lookin foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his asscrack
And when you actin up thats when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
Ill crack your shoulder blade
Youll get dropped so hard
Elvis will start turnin in his grave
I dont know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile
To the trailor park
[Rabbit]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Eric Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
Its all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So Im a German, Eh
Thats ok, you look like a fuckin worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies
Talkin bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek
With paddles this deep
Your still gonna sink
Your a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit
This is a turtle race
He can't get with me spittin this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Spickety spickety split lickety
So Im gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 mile!

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back, guess who's back,
guess who's back...
I've created a monster,
cuz nobody wants to see Marshall no more,
they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya,
a little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
some vodka that'll jumpstart my heart quicker,
then a shock when I get shocked at the hospital,
by the Dr. when I'm not cooperating,
when I'm rocking the table while he's operating
you waited this long now stop debating,
cuz I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney,
but your husbands heart problem's complicating
So the FCC wont let me be or let me be me so let me see
they tried to shut me down on MTV but it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips fuck that,
cum on your lips and some on your tits,
and get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck YOU DEBBIE!)
Chorus (X2)
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cuz we need a little controversy,
Cuz it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
they start feeling the prisoners helpless,
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells ""bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution,
pollutin the air waves a rebel so let me just revel an ask,
the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
and it's a disaster such a catastrophe,
for you to see so damn much of my ass you ask for me?
Well I'm back (batman sound) fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna
enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and nesting
""Testing Attention Please"",
feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me?
Chorus (2x)
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talking this shit that shit. Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards, and Moby
you can get stomped by Obie, you 36 year old bald headed fag blow me
You don't know me, you're too old let go its over, nobody listens to techno
Now lets go, give me the signal I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting, but its just me I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley, to do Black Music so selfishly
and use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
there's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
but no matter how many fish in the sea it'd be so empty without me

To seize everything you ever wanted, one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?  Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin' how, everybody's chokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking, make me king
As we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post-mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows he's grown farther from home
He's no father, he goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partner
But the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin' roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my nine to five
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life, and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my seed, plus
Teetertotter caught up between bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go with my shot, feet fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)

That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out

now shorty momma in the precinct hollerin rape,
i'm convinced man something really wrong with these hoes,
I thought Lil' Kim was hot then she start fucking with her nose, (God Damn)
used to listen to Lauren Hill and tap my feet,
then the bitch put out a CD that didn't have no beats, (uh-huh)
that boy D'Angelo he determined not to fail,
that nigga went butt-ass for his record to sell,
my back shot to help Ashanti hit them high notes,
and Big Ben taught Charlie B'Mor to deepthroat
[CHORUS]
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life,
I wanna hold you in the morning, (I luv'a burnish the monies, the bunnies)
hold you through the night(I just wanna hold you
I just wanna love you for the rest of my life,
I wanna hold you in the morning,
(I just wanna love you)
hold you through the night

You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, ""Bitch you got a sick kid""
Arrested, molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll, disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
""Murder Murder Redrum""
Brain size of a bread crumb
Which drug will I end up dead from
Inebriated, till my stress is eleviated
""How in the fuck can Eminem and shady be related?""
Illiterate, illigitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out (Ahhhh!) killed the bitch and did her
Use to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was little'er
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fuckin Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler
Didn't Ya?  Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
Chorus: Eminem + (Redman Sample) - 2X
[E] I'm low down and I'm shiftee!
""And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
and ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from..""
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like Space Moons
With a bunch crazed loons dismissin brains like braze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits, passed out like Sanford snippits
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'ma let your grandpa hit it
Mix it up with cocaine so her can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb or any alcoholic beverage
Losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
Smoked out like Eckridge
Band just making my neck itch
What the fuck? Gimme the tech bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap hips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitches ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking, is Dirty Dozen's really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
Chorus
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Lit it like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got my swinging
Bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent, toking microphones with Broken English
Make your mama be like ""Ohh! This is good! Who sing this?""
""Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit.""
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic
Living off liquid Triametic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anasin
Frozen Manaquin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for and IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon come is Tupac
It's politics, it's all a fix
Setup by these white blue collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
With a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks

Damn, why don't u ever go away , huh?
(Hook)
We need to stop this shit
And realize what u spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick and i'm gonna respect u
And leave hip hop alone
go promote wack rap
(Eminem)
When i turn on the radio, I get nauseous
annoy your commercial garbage, And make sure i turn it off quick
u make me so sick, It's pointless to even dis
but i do it for the lute and MP3 page hiss
I try to teach kids
but their steady rocking, Eyes bopping heads to Ludacris
swearing that he's nice, Come on he sounds like the newest sensation
to get the party dancing, And bitches asses shakin
making hits faking quick, ? like music
I'll slap u with your own rhyme
o there's your greatest hit
lazy kids with dope beats, And a lot of babbling
in reality you get beat like Eric Estrada battling
but it's not your fault completely
i blame promoters to, hyping up your cd when they got 3 or 4 interludes
companes lute you, Cuz ur making them lute
but when your one hit wares out, They'll drop you for good, your replaceable
(Hook)
Pretend u like Hip Hop, That's a no no!
show your appreciation donate a Volvo
o no, That be to much to ask
actin like Alaskans with that rented ice u flash
I'll come down to your street carrying burners
now your block is hot! hot!
like a heat contained thermos
your nerves now
i see your eyes twitching, doing ? to females
coming out sounding like bitches
retards spiting disses
a bunch of carbon copies
You must of failed the road test, Learning how to write beats
My street, only bumps but it's unreleased
fuck self declared kings of hip hop, There all weak
My rhyme shines brighter then any ice u rock
rhyming in the hook 9 times, ?
lame ducks running on stage with makeup, It's crazy to us
Real Mc's take and get big cuts, Your finished
(Hook)
Stop this shit
And realize what u spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick and I'm gonna respect u
And leave hip hop alone
go promote wack rap fool
Stop this shit
And realize what u spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick and i'm gonna respect u
And leave hip hop for me
go promote wack rap fool
Stop this shit
And realize what u spit
It's me and this garbage
Just shake some ass and tits
Don't act like ur sick you'll be out of fashion quick
leave hip hop alone , you annoying piece of shit

You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody
This year I'm sellin records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin
What the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars
fuck out of here
Chorus One: Eminem
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm just a regular guy,
I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me)
Nobody ever gave a fuck before,
all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me)
Now everybody wanna run they mouth
and try to take shots at me (take shots at me)
[Eminem]
Yo, you might see me Joggin, you might see me walkin
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin(grrrr, ARF ARF)
Or leanin out a window holdin a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car they shot 'Puc in
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been thier's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
The instinct to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick
Boy and girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public
I'ma love it.. (hahaha)
Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh)
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me (yup)
Then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe)
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
and run around screamin,  I don't care, just bite me  (nah nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
and call themselves clowns cause they look queer
Faggot 2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away
I;m not a wrestler, I'll knock you fuckin back and the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and punked out(AHHH!)
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus,  you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!
Chorus Two: Eminem
Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)
[Eminem]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blond mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop? (pop)
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter your attourney Fred Gibson's a faggot!
Talkin about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 Some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off, I walked to the news stand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much troble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

Denaun: Can I speak to Maxine?
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?
Denaun: What up?
Maxine: Who dis?
Denaun: Denaun
Maxine: Yeah what's up?
Denaun: What are you doing?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why?
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do
Verse 1: Eminem
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it  (Maxine!!)
Verse 2: Denaun Porter
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it..  just.. slows.. down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
Verse 3: 3
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said ""Oh it's like that?""
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said ""Maxine check this out,
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things""
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""
I said ""What is it, another nigga?  It's ok""
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""
I got up out
Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money,
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit.
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
Denaun: AIDS
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
Denaun: My nigga Kyu, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit,
so he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me,
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see..
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you

Its such a wonderful feeling, but its always followed by pain.
I feel this for you garion, and you'll never feel this for me.
In fact, you pretty much hate me.

[Intro: Eminem (Fergie)]
Yeah
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you? (daddy's here, here to hold you)
Straighten up little soldier (through the night, through the night...)
Stiffen up that upper lip (through the night...)
What you crying about?
You got me...
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more crying, wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy, aint he?
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
I know it's confusing you
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have gotten so bad between us
I don't see us ever being together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream
[Chorus: Fergie]
Now hush little baby, don't, don't you cry
Everything, everything's gonna be alright
Now hush little baby, don't, don't you cry
Everything, everything's gonna be alright
[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time every house that we lived in
Either kept getting broke into and robbed
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre
And flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it
And you and Laney were to young to understand it
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah
It's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment

this is.. what you thought it wasn't
It beez.. the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G *coughing in background*
And check out the man he goes by the name of er...
Verse One: Eminem
Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm a M80, you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin, Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin at you players worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we comin out in the open
I'm doin acid, crack, smack, coke and smokin dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic (Hi Marshall)
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet cause I'm comin up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm comin out swingin, so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You gettin knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The +Proof+ is in the puddin, just ask the Deshaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfuckin throat worse than Ron Goldman
Chorus:
So when you see me on your block with two glocks
Screamin _Fuck the World_ like Tupac
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Talkin that shit behind my back, dirty mackin
tellin your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
Cause I just don't give a fuuuuuck!!
Verse Two: Eminem
I'm Nicer than Pete, but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's twenty below freezin
Flavor with no seasonin, this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat, gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (Bye-bye!)
Extortion, snortin, supportin abortion
Pathological liar, blowin shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumpin your dead body inside of a fuckin trash can
With more holes than an Afghan
Chorus
Verse Three: Eminem
Somebody let me out this limousine (hey, let me out!)
I'm a caged demon, on stage screamin like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend, shootin up while this record is spinnin
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin the jewel, I'm flippin the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of naggin bosses bitchin while I'm washin dishes
In school I never said much, too busy havin a headrush
Doin too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed
Went to gym in eighth grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin coke and smokin weed again
I'm goin up over the curb, drivin on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in
Chorus
Outro: Eminem
Hey, fuck that!
Outsidaz..
Pace One..

[chorus]
monkey see monkey do

cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do

if they really want it bad enough well then they gunna come
now here they come as we expected now we just set em' up
check-mate motherfucker
games over

tweedle-de-tweedle-dum
[body]
it doesnt take much
for me to raise such a stink up
when motherfuckers hate your guts
you aint even gotta say much
for me to put a pen to a blank sheet of papers
like smearing blood stains with a paint brush
i cant explain what it is my brain does
but however it works its insane
its plain nutz
and it aint just my brain thas dangerous
its a whole combination of things
it takes nutz
and im not affriad to raise the stakes up
i got a million bucks in the banks and 8 trucks
for anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
im patiently waiting for the day
im anxious
to see the look on ya fake mugs
when you thugs go bankrupt
ya drunk
ya aint tough
whatever you drank musta just turned ya into some gangstas
this is me talking motherfucker
this aint drugs
you wanna pop, shit wake-up, then make-up
FUCK THAT
its too late chump now face up
i pray for the day that someone who spits with the calliber that nas and jay does
opens up his jaw to say something or rattle my name off
or rattle the first thing from the top of his brain off
so i can blow the fuckin dust off of this chainsaw
and give him the surgery that he came for
till i pull the paint off
i never been shot
but i think me and 50 musta been cut from the same cloth
cause ive always came off
like ja's chain
when they try to rush him and lost
and came back and gave him a watch in exchange for it
i dont stop
the only thing i wait for
is day that i dont gotta report to probate court
cause ima give ya all the reason to hate more
cause ive been holding my tounge till i got a sprained jaw
alot of rappers on my list that just aint ja
and ima read that motherfucker off from april
you pussies think i went soft since 8 mile
when i come back ill be shootin more than just paint balls
trust me
[chorus]
monkey see monkey do
dont ever make the first move
just let em' come to you
cause they always gunna see and do what the other one do
so let em' come to you
the rest of us follow suit
monkey see monkey do

"251","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/mosh-lyrics-214733.html","eminem","Mosh ","I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
And to the Republic for which it stands
One nation under God
Indivisible...
It feels so good to be back..
I scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel and re-energize and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as I'mma whip someone's ass
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-task
And in juggling both perhaps mastered his craft
Slash entrepreneur who has held onto few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure moving past that
Mr. kisses ass crack, he's a class act
Rubber band man, yea he just snaps back
[Chorus:]
Come along follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need to proceed
Carry on, give me hope, give me strength
Come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel
We gonna fight, we gonna charge, we gonna stomp, we gonna march
Through the swamp, we gonna mosh through the marsh
Take us right through the doors (c'mon)
All the people up top on the side and the middle
Come together lets all bomb and swamp just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause don't matter the weather
If it rains let it rain, yea the wetter the better
They ain't gonna stop us they can't, we stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yea, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell we gonna let em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, Fuck Bush, until they bring our troops home (c'mon)
[Chorus]
Imagine it pouring, it's raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the oval office
Someone's tryina tell us something,
Maybe this is god just sayin' we're responsible
For this monster, this coward,
That we have empowered
This is Bin Laden, look at his head noddin'
How could we allow something like this without pumping our fists
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice in your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify the times it, and multiply by six...
Teen million people, Are equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach alqueda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an Ak-47, let him go, fight his own war
Let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare, to trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes its all lies
The stars and stripes, they've been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, Mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight you know why,
Cause I told you to fight.
[Chorus]
And as we proceed,
To Mosh through this desert storm,
In these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this Weapon of Mass Destruction
That we call our President, for the present
And Mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Do you guy's hear us...hear us...[laughing] (Hailie)

I'm just calling to say hello
Hows the weather, how my father
Am I lonely, heavens no
Mother, mother are you listening
Just a phone call to ease you mind
Life is perfect, never better
Distant making the heart go blind
When you sent me off to see the world
Were you scared that I might get hurt
Would I try a little tobacco
Would I keep on hiking up my skirt
I'm hungry,
I'm dirty,
I'm losing my mind
EVERYTHINGS FINE!
I'm freezing,
I'm starving,
I'm bleeding to death
EVERYTHINGS FINE!
Ya I'm working, making money
I'm just starting to build a name
I can feel it around the corner
I could make it any day
Mother, mother can you hear me
Sure I'm sober
Sure I'm sane
Life is perfect never better
Still your daughter, still the same
If I tell you what you want to hear
Will it help you to sleep well at night
Are you sure that I'm your perfect dear
Now just cuddle up and sleep tight
I'm hungry,
I'm dirty,
I'm losing my mind
EVERYTHINGS FINE!

I'm bleeding to death
EVERYTHINGS FINE!

I love you.

It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
[Eminem]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin ""Freeze""
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in ""Set It Off"" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: ""Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!""
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
and collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin ""TRUCE TRUCE""
and surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me!  It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps

Chorus: repeat 2X {Eminem singing}
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
[Eminem]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)
I said, ""Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here"" *knocks on the door*
""Who's in the den?""
[R] ""It's me and Kelly!""
""My bad, (sorry) let's try another room""
[G] I don't trust you!
""Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods
[G] Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab
""Oh dag!!""
[G] What?
""I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!""
[G] Huh?!

2nd repeat same as original Chorus
""Yo Sue!""
[G] Get away from me, I don't know you
Oh shoot, she's tripping..
[G] I need to go puke!! (Bleahh!)
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
[G] Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!
I said, ""I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt"" (Let go!)
""Would you calm down you're startin to scare me""
She said,
[G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate
Chorus: 1st repeat Em says ""Whoops!"" after first line
and ""It was an accident!"" at the end
2nd repeat same as original Chorus
Susan (wait!) Where you goin' You better be careful
[G] Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
""John, where's Dave at before I bash you?""
[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!
""Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance

of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?""
[D] Well it depends on how may you had
""I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol""

Yeah!
So much for first single on this one
[Verse 1]
Shady's the lable
Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as ms. Butterworths syrup
It's the mr. picked on Christopher Reeves
Just for no reason other than the just to tease him
Cause he was as big as ?? He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin liquor on the crib in his name for him
Eminem you wait till' we meet up again
Fucker I'm kickin your ass for everything you've ever said
It's one for the money two for the fuckin show
Ready get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco stompin and stampedin up the damn street
Like them buffalo soldiers, I told ya I'm bout' to blow
So look out below, geronimo, motherfuckers is dominos
I'm on a roll, around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryna pick up where the Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game
That shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team
I'll get away with murder
I'm Michael J. he's like my Cochran today
We keep the mark furman  tapes
In a safe, locked them away
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to god you was playin
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh I wish I coulda told you to not do the same
Cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single
But I just fucked that up so,
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle
Slap a bitch and smack a ho

Erra Erra Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derick bare naked
chicka chicka chicka ..
Janine just turned 16 and used a fake id
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hehehehehe, to be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and care free
Paris and Nikki's parents must be so tickled to cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory Dickory derr digga
Look at me work wizardry with these words
Am I a jerk or just jerk chicken
Or Chicka chicka chicka chicka jer jer jerkin the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle
Or is it a circle jerk or wait a minute
What am I sayin, allow me to run it back and rewind it
rrrbb lemme ask you again
Am I just jerkin the chain
Am I bizerk or insane
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs
Workin the damn camera filmin one of them
Paris Hilton home made pornos
Who keeps tiltin the lens at an angle
Chicka Chicka
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of them fuckin
When they were just mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse club
And dusted them and went straight to The Source with them
Cause they coulda sworn someone said Nuh-
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
Uh Uh and then they come-to-find-out-it-was-Justin
Sayin 'I'm gonna cum!'
And this was Su-

Any opinions or somethin you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm a dick sucker I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back
As soon as there comes a day that I fall off with Dre
Wake up gay, make up with Ray (Hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken,
Beat a chicken, eat a chicken like it's a big cock(?) bawka-bi-kaw
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick and eat a dick
And stick a dick in your mouth

Hello boys and girls
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy?
I'll bet you do
[Door opens]
who's your daddy?
[Hailie:]
Daddy, what're you doing?
[Beat starts]
[Eminem:]
Haha
[Eminem & Hailie:]
Ok then! everybody, listen up!
[Eminem:]
I'm goin to hell, who's comin' with me?
[Hailie:]
Somebody, please help him!
[giggle]
i think my dad gone crazy!
[Verse #1:]
There's no mountain i can't climb
There's no tower too high,
No plane that i can't learn how to fly
What do i gotta do to get through to you, to show you
There ain't nothing i can't take this chainsaw to
[Hailey Makes Chainsaw Sound]
Fuckin' brain's brawn, and brass balls
I cut 'em off, i got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall, with my framed autographed,
Sunglasses with elton john's name, on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, i been lying my ass off
All this time, me and dre been fucking with hats off
[Dr Dre:]
Suck it marshall
[Eminem:]
So tell Laura and her husband to back off
Before i push this motherfucking button and blast off
And launch one of these russians, and blast off
[Hailie Makes Explosion Sound]
Blow every fucking thing, except afghanistan on the map, off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
[Knocking]
Hailie, tell 'em baby

My dad's lost it

It's like my mother always told me
[Eminem Impersinates His Mom]
Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana Rana,
and codeine and goddamit, you little motherfucker
If you aint got nothin' nice to say then don't say nothin'
uh..
Fuck that shit, bitch, eat a motherfuckin' dick
Chew on a prick, and lick a million motherfuckin' cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy-lips glued to my face with a clit-ring in my nose
Then quit bringin my flows, quit giving me my ammo
Can't you see why i'm so mean? if y'all leave me alone, this wouldn't be my
m.o.
I wouldn't have to go eenie meenie minie mo
Catch a homo by his toe, man i don't know no more
Am i the only fuckin one who's normal any more?
[Hailie:]
Dad
[Chorus]
[Verse #3:]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
And at the same time, make you dry your eyes with the same rhyme
See what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work, so it's easy to misinterpret it at first,
Cuz when i speak, it's tongue in cheek
I'd yank my fuckin teeth before id ever bite my tongue
I'd slice my gums, get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as vanilla ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit, every time i sung
Like R Kelly as soon as ""bump n' grind"" comes on
More pain inside of my brain, than the eyes of a little girl inside of a
plane
Aimed at the World Trade, standin' on Ronnie's grave,
Screaming at the sky, till clouds gather as Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And thats pretty much the gist of it,Parents are pissed, but the kids love
it
Nine millimeter, heater stashed, in two-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, i wouldn't let hailie listen to me neither

compassionate leave
But when I got back was not

Still my daddy died and my heart feels broken inside
He used to say don't you worry
'bout that
Cause I'm worried enough for the
both of us
And then he'd smile
He said just remember what you are
A Mariani with your head held high
You can set your mind to just anything
And don't you let troubles get

Pants, cause I'm white, and he's white, so he's like
My competition I mean, right?
Nope, Paul Wall is dope
And so's Bubba, so BLALALALAPFFTTTTT
B-b-b-b-b-but, I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali
Shuffle, and dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometime's I just play possom, Like I'm asleep that's awesome
I'm like a sleeping Giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite Prey
Sink my teeth in him and fill him, full of poison
And make a noise like snake before I kill him
And let him know that I just don't feel him
And smack him with the backward E, the Eminem emblem
Always thought if you was gonna murder somebody you should face em
Tell em why, look them dead in the eye, then waste em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
And swallow the shell of the hollow who dwell
And the shadows of all who are willing to sell
Their souls, for this rap game, and it g-g-goes
123, 123, 123, that ain't the hook, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers ""Come nearer""
Chorus
My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, And if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
""Shady, I know you're in there, so where? Come here
Talk to me, sit here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? Hahahahaha
Dye it back, come on, try it"" AHHHHHHHHH
No, I told you, leave me the fuck alone will you?
""But I'm here to rebuild you"", But I already killed you!
""But Shady, we were meant for eachother
Think about your mother"", yeah so what of her?
""Well think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes..."", fuck you motherfucker!
I had you beat ""No I was playin' possom, remember?
I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your souls mine
I'm taking it back"", you fucking bitch WHY!
""Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster? haha""
Chorus
My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
""Shady, listen... ""SHADY!"", you hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back""
But I don't want it back! ""Yes you do...""
No I don't! ""Yes you do, you're gonna regret it later!""
No I won't! ""I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the doctor""
Go ahead, I already talked to, Dre yesterday
""Well I got him on the phone right now!""
You're lying, ""yo slim"", HOW, WHY NOW!
Whatup Dre? ""Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to ya
I don't know, it just seems every since you got off ya
Drugs, you became a lot softer""
But Dre, all Shady is is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
""Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back, and let me know what's up""
Fuck this mirror! AHHHHHHH
""I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you""
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch
""Put the gun down"", BYE BYE!
Ok I'm still alive, ""So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit, even if you tried to
Haha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night you, prayed to god
You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right through
Look at this house, look at these cars, I'm so nice, wooo!
Oh, but you didn't know, fame has a price too
That you're just now seeing the downside to
Lose your best friend from highschool, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without Nyquill
Become a valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle
Marshall..."" WHAT! ""no one's gonna love you like I do!""
Chorus
My Darling, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

I don't ever want you to leave me

My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my
My Darling, cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I said, I don't ever want you to leave me
My Darling, you and me were meant to be together
My Darling, and if I cannot have you, no one can, you're my

Chorus: repeat 2X {Eminem singing}
I never meant to give you mushrooms girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
[Eminem]
I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
with first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin
who love booze and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was goin back into usin again (Nah!)
I said,  Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here   *knocks on the door*
Who's in the den?
[R]  It's me and Kelly!
My bad, (sorry) let's try another room
[G] I don't trust you!
Shut up slut!  Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods
[G] Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab
Oh dag!!
[G] What?
I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!
[G] Huh?!

Oh shoot, she's tripping..
[G] I need to go puke!!  (Bleahh!)
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said,
[G] Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!
I said,  I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt   (Let go!)
Would you calm down you're startin to scare me
She said,
[G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello!) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talkin to the plant, look!
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate
Chorus: 1st repeat Em says  Whoops!  after first line
and  It was an accident!  at the end
2nd repeat same as original Chorus
Susan (wait!)  Where you goin'  You better be careful
[G] Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of gettin my hair pulled
I'm not your dad, quit tryin to swallow your tongue
Want some gum?  Put down the scissors, 'fore you do somethin dumb
I'll be right back just chill baby please?
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
John, where's Dave at before I bash you?
[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's takin a crap dude!
Dave!  Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talkin to plants
choppin her hair off, and there's only two days left
of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off?
[D] Well it depends on how may you had
I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps
Now she's upstairs cryin out her eyeballs, drinkin Lysol
[D] She's gonna die dude
I know and it's my fault!

This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?
I float like big spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now
[Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
and make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggaz be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Heard you so long, you be up to get the pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, hoe say my name
[Xzibit]
Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
all the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK?! (Who the FUCK?!) you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I ""Square Dance"" cause I'm sick of rappin circles
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ""Ether""
(Not) I shoulda crossed your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly

Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup  (Wsssshhhhh...)

I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide

This motherfucker man, just won't shut up will you?
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me
I'm promoting you right now
Man lets put the nail in his coffin
[Chorus]
I dont want to be like this
I dont really want to hurt no feelins
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap
Old men have heart attacks
and I dont want to be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
[verse 1]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
an 83 year old fake Pachino
So how can he hold me over some balcony
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me
Please dont, youl probably fall with me
and our asses will both be history
But then again youl finnally get your wish
cuz youl be all over the street like 50 Cent
Fuckin punk pussy fuck you chump
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont fuck you up
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin
You sit behind a fuckin desk at The Source butt-kissin
and beggin motherfuckers for guest appearences
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists
dont even respect you or take you serious
Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn
last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand
Now hes a busta? What the fucks with that?
Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me!
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man
ready to take whatever sentence he hands
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I dont know shit about no shoppin rocks
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots?
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos
Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers
What you know about bein bullied over half your life?
Oh thats right, you know what thats like, your half white
Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, Im eaten you alive inside
Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down
You should be out killin motherfuckers right now
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill'em dead bitch
Shoot'em in the fuckin head, go ahead bitch
Slap my mom, slap the f*ck outa her!
She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you
Cuz your broke as fuck you suck your a fuckin joke
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the fuck
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap
You never had no security, you'll never be famous
You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it?
Raymond, here, let me break this shit down in lamens
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this
and Canibus they usin too many complicated fuckin words for you
Here then let me slow it down for you
so you can understand if I say it slower:
Let it go dawg it's over
[Chorus]
[Eminem talkin]
Haha
Talkin bout I have motherfuckers callin your crib
bitch you aint even got a fuckin crib
You aint even got a fuckin phone, fuckin Bum
Threatened to shut me down at your little fuckin Source magazine
if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first
take it like a man and shut the fuck up
and fuck your little magazine too
I dont need your fuckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz
And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall
oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs?
When you was watchin me from whatever fuckin TV you was watchin me from in Boston
The mean streets of Boston, fuckin sissy
Like you got us scared in the motherfucker, suck our motherfuckin dicks
Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, the Source has a white owner

What up god?
Ya heard?
Chillen, cold as hell
Yes it is, hey Busta didn't come here did he?
No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
Nah, look..
You should just, how much you got there?
I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar know what I mean..
Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
You gotta make some moves or something
I know look, I'm trying to get rich,
I got a baby on the way, I don't even got a car,
you know what I'm saying?
I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something,
you know what I'm saying?  Cause I'm tired of being broke
Verse 1:
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D, this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the brisk of the tea
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a mission less course
When shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh
You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's it
Yeah
A million dollars ain't even that far away man
Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Yeah I hear what your saying,
look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
I can't live like this for the rest of my life man,
bumming rides everywhere I go
Yeah, what's up with Lexus' and Land cruisers'?
Verse 2:
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
The 5 Elemantz for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star
Chorus:
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
>From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player,
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be President
Yo forgot that President man I'm trying to be king,
making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Getting money anytime I want owning my own businesses and all that,
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionare man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once

There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers finally wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I maybe a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
Cuz I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
[Chorus x2 - Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I end up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough
[50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
The spot my talk, it blaze a direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag of the chocolate
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that 'presents me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it I love
Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!
[Verse one: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
""Stomping in my Air Force Ones""
But you won't be able to tell
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the [Eminem vocal scratch]
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy
[Chorus: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We gon' kill your label fa' sho!
[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's real
[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2x]
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!

Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months [gun cocked]
[Verse three: Notorious B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop Watertown
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo Chief, pass the Buddha
[Chorus: 50 cent]
[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass ""catch me if you can""
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me [gun cocked] hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch!
[Chorus: 50 cent]
[Outro: Eminem]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do and we see y'all
We just gon' sit back for a minute
While I see what the FUCK y'all do

Still on probation for stranglin' my boy Jason
Should be takin' my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facin'
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cuz he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eatin' like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure lookin' good!
Rob this little boy in his fuckin' paper route
Throwin' bottles at day care centers and yell ""EVERYBODY GET OUT""!

Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic

Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters

Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg

Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it...""

Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits

They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady, ain't nobody iller than me
[Fuzz]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standin' on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rockin' the most classic threads
Flashin' bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumpin' the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screamin' GET THE COPS QUICK!
And got drop kicked, now she screamin' ""Stop it...""
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scooter '97 crop pick
Sick a-ya'll niggaz lookin' at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggaz still don't know the top pick?
I got bricks, lose my foot in your ass
And have you shittin' socks bitch!
We rock shit, leave your fuckin' knot split
Grab the green from Al by showin' him hot grits
(No one...)
Ain't nobody iller than me
[Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast...

But honey ain't nothing, nothing
Can ever change this love I have for you!
You're the apple of my eye
You're cherry pie
And oh you're, cake and ice cream
Oh you're sugar and spice
And everything nice
You're the girl of my dreams!

Let you inhale the glock smell, while I'm rippin your wallet off 
And slippin a Molotov in your Cocktail (take that)

Smash his glasses and turn em to contacts

Naw(Naw)
We ain't done
I love bein? hated, it's great it
Let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only lets me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers
That hate you in this buzz
You keep fuckin? with us
We keep fuckin? you up
And keep pullin? the rug from up under you
And what's even more fucked up
Is we enjoy what were doin? so much
There ain't nothin? that we love more
Than pullin? your skirts up
And exposin? you hoes so much
People are startin? to wonder
What's up with the fuckin?
Wonder Woman underoos?
Do onto others as you will have done onto you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to?
When someone runs up with a mask
And puts a gun to you
You will ask yourself how come your mans
Didn't enter the last round that he had
In Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin? us to keep it on wax, but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension
Start buildin? soon as we enter the 106 and Park Building
Someone's gonna get killed
And I swear to God if someone so much as even
Touches one of my people I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I rather rap than get into this gangster shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's cause I ain't a bitch
I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general
I ain't Bush
I don't send my soldiers to war if I ain't there
In the middle of this shit with em
So when I do get em
Orders to storm your head quarters
You be fuckin? with a
[Swifty]
A beat keeper, so you ain't eager
To greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggers wanna keep speakin?
Like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a nigger's streets
So ya wouldn't fuck with me neither
Only heaven can help ya
I be searchin? for ya longer
Than The Legend of Zelda
Without a failure
It's gonna be Hell to tell the
Captain that a basset hound
Couldn't even smell ya
Body wanna hide ya
I'll be on that mob shit
You another hopper
Under the Renaissance, bitch
You get bombed like Lebanon with
On tactic
I'll snatch your head like one Saddam's men
[Obie Trice]
Motherfucker, I'll handle you
We can have it out on any avenue
An Average Man, flipped into an animal
Shoot out ya mandibles
Cannons and ammunition reload
With precision, nigger know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down you should see them handles
The streets taught the child no read up manuals
Pushin? crack valves, young Nino Brown
Chasin? green is the dream
When you're young and brown
Bound to be a problem child
Look what I'm involved in now
A Dozen Dirty niggers and they all get down
I'll solve any problem that enlarge
When I was on revolvers
We all get down
[Kuniva]
While you punchin' and tacklin' punks
I'm handlin' chumps, packin' the pump
That's longer than the elephant's trunk
On the streets I'm the beast, I'll feast
Upon the weak, so speak beef
I'll shoot you and scream
Increase the peace
The monster, pistol packin'
Pushin' niggers off they Hondas
Stomp ya, get it crackin'
Yankin' bitches for they Ganja
Sneaky as fuck
I don't think mamma beat me enough
When she was sleepin? and stuff
I was stealin? the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up
Before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin? a nap
Bleedin? and locked up
You want what?
Like M Bleak with this heat
If your ten deep, then fuck
It'll be ten asleep
[Proof]
Don't mess with my alasnke
Don't tussle with my aspe
Clutch your burner
Bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast, don't host us
Approach us
Through heat straight from the shoulders
We the soldiers, you're the youngster's
Youngster's among
Aren't ya dead in the dumpster?
Say to the monster head full of drama
You scared of the trauma
Vomit to monster
(Woof!) I'm back nigger
(Poof) I reappear
Shoot like, you ain't seein? clear
Blackness, carcass, cover with catfish
We mercers with no purpose
Other than practice
[Bizarre]
Theirs three things I hate
Liars, fakes, and cheaters
Alcohol, and sluts, and fuckin? wife beaters
I guess that describes my life
I don't even know whose song this is
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck
About no Hip-Hop
At my release party
In a pink tank top in Reebok's
This Ja Rule beef, I'm not gettin? in
I need an R&B singer
To sing at my weddin? (Say yeah)
I'll turn your face into a fuckin' meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy
And go fishin? with your granny
I'll shit on you
I'll pee on R Kelly too

These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I don't care I ain't afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You won't spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I don't care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now we'll end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I don't really give a damn I'll kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot

And rappers always stuck to me and tried to lie

When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there's none left

And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she don't want none of me

That I'm from the friggen D
Ya'll don't get my point I'm from Detroit
Smoking fake grass like a joint
That's the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night I'll still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really don't care your style needs to switch
Cause you ain't rich, that's why you ain't rich
Remain underground, can't come off the top
You can't drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
I'm a motherfucking landmine
Ya'll don't understand mine
I'm Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but I'm nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldn't have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, I'm on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp unheard, no its not

I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck [crash]
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Gotta have it, I hold Tylenol in his hands
Til it melts in his fuckin palms and dissolves in his glands
[So who is it?] The fool who visit the playground

Wit a pistol grip and fed pitbulls shit
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits

Got the drugs stopped inside the lunch box [uhh]

Popped the trunk and pulled out the shotgun pump

Wit a automatic callin me up there

Stakin my house out in a tan tinted Sedan
He pull your mouth out til you can't finish a damn

Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey ma, maybe I'll give you a call
Sike you fuckin bitch, suck a dick and two balls

[Intro- 50 Cent]
Shady Aftermath
G-Unit!
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off
Right let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on the right swing one last time
Get ya ass up for the doctor
One more time get ya ass up for the doctor
Come on here we go cliff hanger
It's another club banger got ya hangin on the edge of ya seat
Get on down
[Verse 1]
[Dr. Dre]
Time's up game's over you lose I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yea new year next phase begin
Look who's got you goin crazy again
I'm a trend I set one everytime I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you're somethin that we already had
But once you're gone you don't come back
[Eminem]
Too bad you're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind you slip we out grind you
You walk around mad you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin and moanin, whinin and bitchin
Sittin observed, listen you'll learn if you pay attention
While 10 multi-platinum albums lay the three diamond
World wide we on the charts with a bullet we're still flyin
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off
Right let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game
Without atleast sayin good-bye
So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time
When Dr. Dre says crunk you will get it crunk
Get it crunk (Crunk crunk crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump
You will get on one foot and (Jump jump jump)
[Verse 2]
[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous we drop you all just sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know the Doc is off the benches
[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin off the hinges
We ain't showin off, we just goin off popular concenses
[Dr. Dre]
But critics say the Doc is soft, Doc is talk
The Doc is all washed up knock it off
Who the fuck is Doc impressin
Doc is this Doc is that you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc cuz Doc left you all guessin
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record
We gonna have this mothafucka hoppin in a second
Thats why we always save the best cut last
To make a scratch and itch to it like fresh cut grass
[Eminem]
Cause we just playin with the sharks wrestlin with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers whom if it wasnt for rap
Embraced the gat or maybe raised to be racist who may have never
Got to see our faces, graced the cover of Rolling stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races, just call on the
Cape crusaiders and leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day like the hot potatoe game
Thats why we
[Chorus- Eminem]
Cause we came here to set this party off
Right let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't wanna ever leave the game

So all my people on my left
All my people on my right swing one last time
50 Cent come on!
[Verse 3]
[50 Cent]
Bounce now hands up you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret everybody know when Dre's involved
There's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honies involved and sunny sunday's and palm trees
Cali everyday is just another party from the vallies
All the way to them 8 mile alleys
[Eminem]
Let's ralley hands up for the grand finale now raise up your seat
Dre's about to speak blaze a pound of weed six days about the week
[Dr. Dre]
You can catch me in the studio bangin out the ??
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin out ya speaker

So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit records presents the return of the

[Intro]
I told ya'll mothaf**kas I was comin back
What now ***** what now what
You's the projects *****
[Chorus- Eminem]
One shot two shot three shot four shot
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off
[Verse 1- Bizarre]
You bitches is gone I'm dropped in the club
And I'm tryna run and get my mothaf**kin gun
(***** what about your wife)
***** f**k my wife I'm tryna run and save my mothaf**kin life
Oh shit the shoot is comin
Bitches, hoes *****s is runnin
People shot all over the floor
And I'm tryna make it to the ?? door
Thats the sound of the glock
Even DJ ?? f**ked around and go shot
I done messed around and forgot my tec
I don't see no body but Fab Five and Hex
[Verse 2- Kuniva]
(Kuniva you aight)
These *****s is trippin
(Where's Bizarre at?)
I'm tryna slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screamin everywhere and *****s is wilin
Two minutes ago we was all jokin and smilin
This chick is clingin onto me sobbin and sighin
Sayin she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she cryin
But its real and cats is gettin killed
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield
And she got hit now she yellin
(Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch would leave me
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my 38 I hope its not to late
[Chorus- Eminem]
One shot two shot three shot four shot
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off
[Verse 3- Swifty]
(***** I been tryna call you all day mothaf**ka where you at?)
I'm on seven mile what the f**k was that
Damn somebody hit me from the back
(With they car?)
With a gat ***** and my tire is flat
And I just hit a pole, them *****s some hoes
(Is you hit?)
Iono but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitzubeashe (sp?) wit
(Shit thats the clique we beefin wit I swear)
Man and I was on my way there
Believe me I'm leavin a carcus today
I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tuck
I'ma meet you at the club we gon' f**k these hoes up
[Chorus- Eminem]
One shot two shot three shot four shot
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off
[Verse 4- Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this is my life before
People will still camp out from the night before
Sleepin outside the door waitin in line
Still tryna get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshall no, the van houston's small
People are wall to wall three thousand and some odd vans
And some come walk from out the parkin lot
Get into an argument over a parkin spot
He's about to pull his gun out and let's a few of 'em off
Missed who he's aimin for six feet away's the door
In St. Andrew's hall not a stray slidin all over the place
Sprays one bitch in the face another one of 'em came through the
wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up by the bar havin a Mozeltoff
Bullet wizzed right by my ear damn near shot it off
Thank god I'm alive I gotta find Denaun
And where the f**k is Von he usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the f**k oh my god it was
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him haulin ass I think he left his wife
There she is on the ground bein trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand and I can't pull her
God damn there just went another damn bullet I'm hit
My vest is barely able to handle it, its to thin
If I get hit again I can't do it, I scoop deep
Follow Bizarre's path and ran through it
And made it to the front door and collapsed on the steps
Looked up and I seen Swift shootin it out
But I can't see who he's shootin it out with
But Denaun's right behind him squeezin his four fifth
[Chorus- Eminem]
One shot two shot three shot four shot
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off
[Verse 5- Kon Artis]
It's Friday night came to this bitch right
Big ass to my left and Desert Eagle to my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party I came in this bitch to
fight
Although I can't stay here to fight cuz I'm poppin *****s
tonight
Thats right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for tryna check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here so its clear that this f**ka
Shoot out the back of his truck goes up in this mothaf**ka
So one shot for the money two's to stop the show
Third's for the bartender there's plenty of shots to go
(I just wanna know who's drivin a black mitzubeashes)
He tried to run so Proof shot him in the knee wit a three piece
[Chorus- Eminem]
One shot two shot three shot four shot
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's lickin shots off

You got me spinning round and round

I here you breath
somewhere in my sleep

And when i wake from slumber see you in my dreams

I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you acting slice when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MC's, now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot, people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites

Inferior, deterior rate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when u hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason

Growing up in a suburban home

I'm Freezing (*sneeze*) I'm Sneezing
I'm breathing to much cold air

I said I'm goin on the front porch to get something!

My teacher's two faced
He went to lower all my school grades
Cuz last thursday i had a tooth ache  from kool-aid
So mom kicked me out
[D]
Get Out!!
[E]
All i had was my suitcase,
A shoelace, a tube sock
And a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool
Cuz i could go to a freinds
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather be home
In my own room, Alone
beatin my shit
And nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle till he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
""I don't know where it is..""
But as soon as mom found it
I would either get grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks
I'm still countin!
Even when I was under age......
Mom was tellin cops i was tryna run away......
I told her ""Some day bitch, you gonna pay....""
Please mom please mom please I wanna stay....
(Let me stay!)
(chorus)
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...(yo)
In the middle of the street
[E]
My brothers incoharent
Moms a single parent
Who ain't caring, Staring through me like I'm transparant
Made it clear that i was just there to run her errands
Told her friends that i was the son from her last marrage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
[D]
Please sell my stepson ciggarettes so i can smoke.
[E]
One time i tried to fake a stich to get attention..
Back fired and mom sent me to school with vengence
My life is the worst thing that could ever have happened to me
I go to class and every teachers always laughing at me
Mom says ""white rappers always get laughed at""
Not only that, she heard me upstairs and i can't rap
But I'm stupid
I'll never make it average or a D+
I need to sit on my ass
And just sue people like she does
One time I got food poisening from a hotdog
Mom sued and got $2000 from Ballpark
Hey mom you got a doller?
[D]
I don't Think so
Now keep an eye on your brother,
I'm Going to bingo
[E]
But mom you said.. you were broke
[D]
who said?
You got your ears messed up (awwww)
From that damn rap music
(chorus to fade)
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street
Our house...
In the middle of the street

Nah, we ain't done
I love bein hated, it great
It let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way
I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
by so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And is bomb, as you keep fuckin with us, we keep fuckin you up
And keep pullin the rug from up under you
And what's even more fucked up, is we enjoy what were doin
so much there ain't nothin that we love more than +Pullin Your Skirts Up+
And exposin you hoes so much, people are startin to wonder
what's up with them fuckin one dough a man under rules
Do on to others as you will have done under you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you (*gun cocks*)
You gonna ask yourself, how come your mans
didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance
You keep askin us to keep it on wax but we can't
This is past any rationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start buildin
soon as we enter the '106th & Park' building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
if someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch, I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
If I ain't there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fuckin with a ..
[Swifty McVay]
Fuckin with a piece keeper, see you a nigga that greet this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggaz wanna keep speakin, like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a nigga street (*explosion*)
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searchin for you longer than the ""Legend of Zelda""
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
captain that a bassett hound couldn't even smell ya
body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance bitch
You get bombed like Lebanon (*explosion*) with my own tactic
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's wigs
[Obie Trice]
Motherfucker, I'll handle you
We can have it out on any Avenue
A +Average Man+ flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles
Cannons and ammunition, reload with precision
Nigga know the mechanicals
Break a pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Pushin crack vows, young Nino Brown
Chasin green is the dream, when your young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggaz and they all get down
Dissolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said ""all men get out"" (*gunshot*)
(Eminem: c'mon)
[Kuniva]
While your punchin and tacklin punks
I'm handlin chumps, packin a pump
that's longer than the elephant trunk (*gun cocks*)
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shot you and scream ""increase the peace""
A monster, pistol packin pushin niggaz off they Hondas
Stomp ya, get it crackin, yankin bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleep and stuff, I was stealin the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up, before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets takin a nap, bleedin and lumped up
+Who Want What+ like M. Bleek, with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleepin (*gunshots*)
[Proof]
Don't muscle with my a land ski
Don't tustle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the shoulders (c'mon, *gunshot*)
We the soldiers, y'all the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster (*gunshot*)
Upstairs the Munster, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster (*gun cocks*, boof)
I'm back nigga (Proof), I reappear
Shoot like (*gunshot*), you ain't seein clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice (bitch)
[Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fuckin wife beaters
A gat that describes my life (damn)
I don't even know who song this is (scratched - *Obie Trice*)
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top and Reeboks (*laughing*)
This Ja Rule beef I ain't gettin in
I'll need an R & B singer to sing at my wedding
I turn your face into a fuckin meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishin with your granny
I'll +Shit on You+, I'll pee on R. Kelly too
This is Bizarre, see you ""Devil's Night 2""

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfucking P-I-M-P
[repeat]
Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce and Gabana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her cause they wanna
I spit a little G man, and my game got her
A hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look baby this is simple, you can't see
You fucking with me, you fucking with a P-I-M-P
[chorus]
I'm bout my money you see, girl you can holla at me
If you fucking with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me, if you curious to see
how it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P
Girl we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl we could have it all
We could really splurge girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up, if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch
[chorus]
I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holla at a hoe til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me I got on gator shoes
I'm shopping for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man this hoe you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin know
You saying it's secret, but you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch choose with me, I'll have you stripping in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Nik my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your hoe out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
Cause I need 4 TVs and AMGs for the six
Hoe make a pimp rich, I ain't paying bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick
[chorus]
Yeah, in Hollywoood they say there's no b'ness like show b'ness
In the hood they say, there's no b'ness like hoe b'ness ya know
They say I talk a lil fast, but if you listen a lil faster
I ain't got to slow down for you to catch up, bitch

Like a baby born dead
Destination heaven
Sittin political passengers from 911
The lords blessins leave me lyrically inclined
Shit I ain't even got to try to shine
Gods to seamstress the tailor fitted my pane
I got scriptures in my brain
I can spit at yo dame
Straight out the good
Fuck, look niggas is shook
50 fear no man
Warrior, swing swords like conan
Picture me, pen in hand write lines
Knowin The Source will quote it
When i die
They'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops
Should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white mans world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin for a slut wit a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringin again

I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin? mayhem u stayin? wit me?
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin to confuse you
When I let loose wit this uzi and just shoot through your isuzu
You get the message?
Am I gettin through to you?
You know its comin
You motherfuckers dont even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got tha realest and illest killas tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin? like survivin? the shot
Y'all know what time it is
As soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats?
Cause I get a lot
Shady records was 80 seconds away from the towers
Them cowards fucked wit the wrong building

And tap your man back be like:

Oh yes, comin' from the mother friggen mid west
Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day three times a night

Jumpin' out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a benz jeep
Girls be like: Eminem changed his style up
Shut up the hell up i'm still seven mile slut!
it's 97 so get witt it
Peep that back in the day stuff on the Infinite tape resetin'
Listen, must we forget it

Peace to all my outsiders and jers

Pull my nine milli you gon' die with your fist out
Henemous is over with

Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober bitch
My bite on phonics, demonish your lonic, demonic can't stand the chronic impossible to hold on like vomit
Mics I palm it, cause they the bombit
Like terroristict Islamic I enter your atma, feel like a comet
The new god of rap, call me Bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in a figure 4
From miles around they can feel us, lethal

Make your heart beat for your tryna' get down with us

Hand me an .8
Beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white person trapped in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people will feel me
Cause I'ma still be the Madd Rapper
Whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off
Even the No Limit Tank looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No damn I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?

Yah need to run for cova'

Yes, yes in the flesh

Oooooooooooooooh, shit, that's how we do it baby
""Every day like this?""  Seven dayy-ayyys

Uh, hear me out now

The Mayor of Nellyville and I won't resign, watch me recline
Cause you wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You really wanna put your feet on my rug, don'tcha?
You're in a hurry - SLOW DOWN - bitch I got all night
Matter fact, stand on my left boo - I know you ain't right

(O trice common)
Yeah niggas got me
I'ma get em, it aint over
[Chorus - Obie Trice]
You can catch me in a wip with a fifth of pimp juice
And I'm popin a clip, bout to fix this issue
You pray that I don't hit, I'm not equipped to miss you
Your gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue
Or either have a bag on your hip to shit through
You seen us on the ave, aim just to get you
But my penis is a mag when I lift it hit you
Cause I don't go anywhere without my pistol pistol
[Verse 1- Obie Trice]
I, solemnly swear on my daughters tears
The nigga that got em in the head, and feel it before the year ends
Hope you inconspicuous my friend
Cause once the word get back, your in a world of sin
Bullets will hurdle at him
For try'in to murda whats been determined as the first solo African
And go platinum with an accident, happened that
But maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back
My momma blood pressure was affected from that
My little girl need her daddy on the phone at a certain time, exact now
Them nigga act wild
But when the mac come out, you niggas X out
Now I don't wanna hear X, Y , Z
im X'n out your whole entity for try'in to kill meFilthy mother fuckers I'll show you what real be
When these HTB‘s light up your kidneys

It's not a verse it's a curse from burse
And whats on your purse
And over hear, this is Obie here I'm clear
Niggers bewhere I'm commin at you with firearms an here
And your purpose on suprefinous, how can I be merciful
When mercamies is a mercenaries gold
Nigga I got paper, I'll have your urgently exposed
No emergencies bringin back ur souls
Slugs shatter your bone for pat pat me in the dome
Learn is powderin
We catch him at home, he rome
That when automatics sporadically catch him in the abdomen
Another dirty mother fuckers gone, YEAH!

Smith and Wesson's the weapon in case you just guessing, (God Damhn)
these straight busters kept-in, kept-in my benz, hop-in the end's,
watch the 22 spin , my hoes they perfect 10
I got shot up but I got up and i'm back at it again,
motherfuckers they thought I wouldn't win, pretend to be friends,
at first you fail, try, try, try, try again,
i'm the best don't you get it, forget it, when I spit it, its crazy,
you love it, admit it, you like it, I live it, its Shady,
aftermath in your ass bitch, if its not a classic,
When it's dumped, trash it, flow I got it mastered,

I'm a drink til I get to that bitch in the ghetto,
Introduce me to the burbs they gonna listen to my words,
In the hood they feel my shit...

Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me start shit, picture me busting my gat,
picture police mad they ain't gotta picture of that,
picture me being broke, picture me smokin the sack,
picture me comin up, picture me rich from rap,
picture me blowin up, now picture me going back,
to my momma basement to live, shit, picture that,
where I'm from its a fact, you gotta watch your back,
you wear a vest without a gat, you's a target jack,
hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack,
sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, Holla back,

I like Eminem because he can rap better then me
I know I'm no movie star or rap star

be able to produce my own alubm or have a demo of something
I like Dr. dre and vanilla ice can kiss my ass
This is Pretzel's freestyle i may suck but i can a least try
My friend derek is a punk but he is the coolest guy i know not!
just kidding
I had a great life going up not like Eminem but he likes to rap about his life
and i think that is cool
That cleaning out my closet is a great song and i like it
This is Pretzel's freestyle i may suck but i can a least try

my momma used to tell me these crazy things.
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man,
she used to tell me he hated me.
But then I got a little bit older and I realized,
she was the crazy one.
But there was nothin? I could do or say to try to change her,
cuz that's just the way she was.
They said I can't rap about bein? broke no more.
They aint say I can't rap about coke no more.
(AHHH!) Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
?till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?!
(AHHH!) These motherfuckers are thinkin? I'm playin?
Thinkin? I'm sayin? this shit cuz I'm thinkin? it just to be sayin? it
(AHHH!) Put your hands down BITCH, I ain't gon' shoot you.
I'ma pull +YOU+ to this bullet, and put it through you
(AHHH!) Shut up slut, you're causin? too much chaos
Just bend over and take it slut, okay Ma?
?Oh, now he's rapin? his own mother, abusing a whore,
snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?""
You goddamn right BITCH, and now it's too late,
I'm triple platinum and tragedies happened in two states.
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
vain Vicodin, vrinnn Vrinnn, VRINNN! {*chainsaw revs up*}
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Danglin? from his neck, while his head barely hangs on.
Blood, guts, guns, cuts.
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts.
Chorus: Eminem
Bitch I'ma kill you!  You don't wanna fuck with me.
Girls neither- you ain't nuttin but a slut to me
Bitch I'ma kill you! You ain't got the balls to beef.
We ain't gon' never stop beefin? I don't squash the beef.
You better kill me! I'ma be another rapper dead
for poppin? off at the mouth with shit I shouldn'ta said.
But when they kill me - I'm bringin? the world with me.
Bitches too! You ain't nuttin? but a girl to me.
..I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady, ('cause why?)
'Cause Shady, will fuckin? kill you. (ah-haha)
I said you don't, wanna fuck with Shady, (why?)
Cuz Shady, will fuckin? kill you

Bitch I'ma kill you! Like a murder weapon, I'ma conceal you
in a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and film you
Buck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up!
I'm tryin? to develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't acid rap, but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added.
WHOOPS! Is that a subliminal hint? NO!
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? NO! Eminem'll assault.
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
to do it again, THEN, if he does it again
you'll probably end up jumpin? out of somethin? up in the 10th
(Ahhhhhhhh!) Bitch I'ma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus.
I ain't even drugged you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
in the tub but that's normal ain't it, Norman?
Serial killer hidin? murder material
in a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine,
out of our minds, and we want in yours, let us in.
Chorus (first line starts ""Or I'ma kill you!"")

Eh-heh, know why I say these things?
Cause ladies? screams keep creepin? in Shady's dreams.
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
these eighty G's a week to say the same things TWEECE!
TWICE? Whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots! I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
just to argue with 'em cuz their ratings stink?
FUCK THAT! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer,
from fat bitch to all seventy-thousand pounds of her.
From principal, to the student body, and counselor,
from in-school, to before school, to out of school.
I don't even believe in breathin?, I'm leavin? air in your lungs

OKAY, I'M READY TO GO PLAY
I GOT THE MACHETE FROM O.J.
I'M READY TO MAKE EVERYONE'S THROATS ACHE!
You faggots keep eggin? me on ?till I have you at knifepoint,

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fuckin' sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But ? would probably be a little more, more suitable for this type of song--whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars, this ain't enough to put some ink ta
So fuck it, I'ma start right here by just be brief-a
Bout to rattle off some other reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
On my arm, but what do I go and do
I go and get another one, now I got two
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm sittin' here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim

For every motherfuckin' thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you

Every time I think of you
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta, a stupid piece a
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fuckin' hate you in a freestyle
You're a fuckin' cokein' slut, I hope you fuckin' die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fuckin' guts, you fuckin' slut, I hope you die
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna
gag-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ag
What else can I do, I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now, I'll I wanna do

Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valiums inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch
And stomped the foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
(Shooting)
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumb ass sit down

Get her ass on the couch before she crashes out

You see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It's gotta be acid cuz the X is gone
Ya I took them all dog with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
Think I'm about to die when I just got on
So stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit

And date each other
And somethin, somethin, somethin, somethin
Somethin, somethin, somethin, somethin... ehh

Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was Incredible I killed the Hulk
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for dope to smoke
I overdose
When I pack up my nose with coke
(cough cough cough)
Am I suppose to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle it (You're crazy!)
[Swifty]
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin mine
Hey you got any shrooms?
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs
Cuz our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
I do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like smack, then I might too (Swift, chill)
I just wanna get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they're white or blue

Even smoke weed outta vacuums

That's all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like i look familiar
You wanna battle?
You beat around the bush
Like you scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push

You need to take your white ass back across 8 mile

[Eminem (Dr. Dre):]
You find me offensive? I find you offensive
For finding me offensive
Hence if I should draw a line on any fences
If so to what extense if
Any, should I go? 'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say that I cause extensive
Pshycological nerve damage to the brain when I go to lenghts this,
Far at other people's expenses
I say your all just too god damn sensitive
It's censorship
And it's down right blasphomous
Listen to shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Chirs-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me
I even believe I, had one of those 25 cent stickers on my re--fridgerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must have put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luther
I killed Superman, I killed Super--man
And how ironic, that I'd be the bad guy
Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
[Chorus:]
Cause I ain't got no legs!
Or no brain, nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name!
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil my new name is....
Rain Man
Now in the Bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed,
Have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course, it's intercourse
And it's bi-sexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during or after peforming the act of that which
Is normally referred to have such, more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids
In a more derogatory way but
Who's to say, what's fair to say, and what not to say?
Let's ask Dr. Dre
Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I gotta question if I may? (Yeah)
Is it gay to play Putt-Putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But, ut! I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hutt-hutt
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney but he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't mean to go in into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a females butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
Til then i'll just walk around with a manly strut because...
[Chorus]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit, this is the same verse I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenceses
My spider senses telling me Spiderman is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whip ass canister
God damn it Dre where is the god damn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, Kryptonite: The Green Chronic
Demonic, yep yep, don't worry I'm on it
I got it, high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pen in Jessica's head and walked away
And she blew around the room like a balloon-a
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can and screw my
Head is straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter, jelly, chicken, tuna sandwhich
And I don't gotta make no god damn sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
[Chorus]
Cause IIIAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHAHAHAAA AAAAAHAHHHHHHHHHH
Yo, Rain Man
Definately, definately Dr. Dre super dope beat maker two thousand and
Two thousand four hundred and eighty seven million
Nine hundred and n seventy three thousand four hundred and sixty three

        Look, I was gonna go easy on you and not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
If that means, what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble,
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
You were just what the doctor ordered
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)
This slickety, gibbedy, hibbedy hip hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap
Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac, pack backpack rap, yep, yackidy-yac
The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing
That I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a Maxipad
It's actually disastrously bad
For the wack while I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece as
I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid, did nothing but shoot for the moon since
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N-
-W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off of planking, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay looking boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
You witnessing a massacre
Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
I got a ""hell yeah"" from Dre looking boy
I'mma work for everything I have
Never ask nobody for shit, get outta my face looking boy
Basically boy you're never gonna be capable
To keep up with the same pace looking boy
'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to,
Censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Marshall Mathers LP
One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I've
Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
You're like normal, fuck being normal
And I just bought a new Raygun from the future
To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad
Singin' to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
""Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you""
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, (JJ Fad)
Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
And take a vacation to trip a broad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not, why be a king when you can be a God?

How impossible cream manifest in the games that be comin with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
and losin some of your peers
And losin some of your self

Sign a deal emcees wanna make a mill
But never will
Till he crosses over still
Feelin no hate
But fantasies come wit these
Just to sacrifice the taste of makin cheese
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz
And take shit from people who don't know what it is

And some can't pay to play

Tell me what happened when you lost clout

May I have your attention please,
Will the real Slim Santa please stand up.
I repeat will the real Slim Santa please stand up.
We're gonna have a problem here.
You all act like you've never seen Santa before,
Toys all over your floor, who the hell ya think brought them?
It wasn't your drunk dad or your mother that whore,
It was me and now I'm skinny and I'll tell you the score.
Its the return of Christmas but not the jolly fat elf,
my ass got so big I couldn't wipe it myself.
My doctor said, ""Santa you've never looked worse, lose 200 pounds
or your heart's gonna burst.""
Everybody loved me big and fat
ho-ho-ho,
Big ass Santa look at him walking around,
his belly like jelly, have some more eggnog.
They didn't give a *fuzz* if my arteries clogged,
So I said *fuzz* them and I joined a gym.
Started eatting low-fat cookies and drinking milk that was skim.
I lost so much weight I can see my candy cane,
and Mrs. Clause is happy I can *fuzz* her again.
(Your name is on my list) x2,
and if your nice, not naughty I might give you a little gift.
But here's a message for you if your a big fat slob,
If your gut is in the way your girl won't bobble your knob.
You can't expect a hoe to gobble your goo,
if you just sit there eatting twinkies,
watching Scooby Doo.
If you ain't nothing but chubby,
no girl wants a fat hubby, you'll end
up working construction.
Your love life lies in ruins and destruction,
by the time your 30 you'll be asking Santa for liposuction.
But if your thin you'll get seduction,
underneath the mistletoe.
Sing the chorus and it goes!
I'm Slim Santa, yes I'm the real Kringle.
All you fly girls like my balls cause they jiggle,
so won't the Real Slim Santa please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up.
Cause I'm Slim Santa, yes I'm the Saint Nick.
All you other fat Santa's can suck my fat *fuzz*,
so won't the Real Slim Santa please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up.
Ho-Ho-Ho I guess theres a Slim Santa in all of us.
On Donner on Blitzen lets get the *fuzz* out of here!

and stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets?
FUCK THAT!  PBBT!  Tou faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
and re-appear in hell with a can of gas, AND a match

Don't you remember me?!
Remember me?!!
Remember me??!

Remember me? (""I'm 'High Powered'"")
Remember me? (""I drop bombs like Hiroshima"")
For this one it's the X, you retarded?
Cause I grab the mic and get DOWN, like Syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses, without boundaries
which qualifies me for the term ""universal""
Without no rehearsal, I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not, the one you wanna contest, see
cause I'll hit yo' ass like the train did that bitch
that got ""Banned From TV"" -- heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco-is-the-motion, we comin through
Hollow tips is the lead, the .45 threw

Niggaz that take no for an answer, get told no
Yeah I been told no but it was more like, ""No, no, no!!!""
Life a bitch that'll fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor

The shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead-a the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta one metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence? NOPE! Never leave a shred-of

Want beef, nigga? PBBT! You better dead that shit
My name should be ""Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit""
Probably sayin, ""He ain't a killer"", but I'm killin myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'ma do to you, have done to you
Got niggaz in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do, cocksuckers? We glock busters
'Til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us

I'm tryin to clear up my fuckin' image,

I wouldn't say ""fuckin"" for six minutes
(*click* Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde

Motherfuckers -
say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels (bling bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin
what I do through and through and
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade; you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters, and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crossed over
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?
I help them see they way through it - not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt
[Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!
(Ha ha!) And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go - he's {*Jigga joint Jigga-chk-Jigga*}

Never been afraid to say
what's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a RENEGADE Never been afraid to holler
about anything anything? Anything ANYTHING!
(jay z)
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor - thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up
Raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky
Big I did it - multi before I die (nigga)
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
[Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you
What did I do? (huh?) I'm just a kid from the gutter
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin

My ass is clean, I smash your spleen

With a cell phone, now who the hell is home?
Y'all can't tell Paul how to throw me words

You get your head blown, rappers try to step, they speak in the dead tones
So I ain't trying to hear them, give me another, word to your mother

Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be drumming
Running with this shit when I kick MC's in the stomach

Off peanut butter, you see my dick and you start to stutter

That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
And coming back to get your parents, well I have it
These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole

In Times Square, I got blond hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there

I know you want it, I get plunted(?), then I

They should have never let us get off foot in this game...
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missin a screw like Bishop and Juice
I could lose it at any moment
Those who know me know it
So they probaly told you go with the flow
Just so that I don't explode
And have another episode where I let it go as far as
The one with Benzino did I'm waitin for that next beef,
I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad I'm goin bananas,
My dick's so hard Anna Nicole could use it to fuckin pole vault with
Oh shit, I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lipoed it
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name it's a game
Cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing,
People in this game try to buddy buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that
They all tryin to get that stamp
They after that Shady - Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probaly just now finally understand how to rob fully
50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery
And a damn slot machine at the same time as eachother
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
When we rhyme with eachother
In time we discovered that we have more in common
Then we thought with eachother
Both robbed of our mothers
Our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault
Cause we started thinkin god doesn't love us
Two odd motheruckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica Queens
I still remember the call up in ??
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia
Two years later me and Doc had to come and operate
That's when he popped up a number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wond-erin
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't gotta agree all the time with me
Or see eye to eye there'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is if it is I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin buisness as usual
Ego's aside, fore I bruise em' all
Swallow your pride fore I step on it with shoes you call Nike's
Earth links how do you like these you gotta love them
Look at the bottom of em' they're like cleats
Stompin, I been rompin since Tim Dogg was hollerin
'Fuck Compton'
I was whilin', freestylin back when they was still makin Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even raps Elvis yet
That tells us that any doubts in your head that seals the shit

Still with the Diggy-Diggy-Doc-Diggy-Diggy-Doc

Sometimes I just feel like
Quittin I still might
Why do I put up this fight?
Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealing with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white
Sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right
Hit the breaklights
In case of the stage fright
Draw on the blank light
(Uhh, But if I fall, It ain't my fault, Breakin eyeballs, My insides crawl)
And I clam up (SMASH!)
I just slam shut
I just can't do it
My whole manhood's just been stripped
I've just been ripped
So I must been dipped
Or the bustin split
Man fuck this shit yo
I'm goin the fuck home
Rollin my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Rd.
(Chorus)
I'm a man
I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to stand up and travel new land
Time for me to just to take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man
I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Rd.)
And I'm gone
I don't like where I'm goin
Sorry mama I've grown
I must travel alone
Ain't no followin no footsteps
I'm makin my own
Only way I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Rd.
Walkin these traintracks
Tryin to regain back the spirit I have
'Fore I go back to the same crap (SMASH!)
To the same plant
And the same pants
Tryin to chase rap
Gotta move A.S.A.P.
Get a new plan
Mama's got a new man
Poor little baby sister
She don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, bury's her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother, her mother, and dad
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset
Cuz I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I aint grownin two nuts yet
Don't gotta rap my step
Don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
I'm just tryin to do what's best
And I try
Sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell a lie
Not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky
Please I'm beggin you God
Please don't let me be pigeon holdin on regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me hommie
Wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin you dog
I'm bailin this trailor tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her
Kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby
I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there
The only way I know
And I'ma do that for you
On the second that I blow
On everything I own
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go
Back to this 8 Mile Rd.
(Chorus)
Ya gotta live it to feel it
If you didn't you wouldn't get it
We'll see what the big deal is
Why it wasn't, it still is
To be walkin this border line of Detroit city's limit
It's different, it's a certain significant certificate of authenticity
You'd never even see
But it's everything to me
It's my credibility
You've never seen, heard, smell, or met an MC
Who's incredible and on the same pedistool as me
But check
Still unsigned
Havin a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friend's who kick dumb rhymes
Go to work
And servin MC's in the lunch line
But when it come's crunch time
Where do my punch lines go?
Who must I show?
To bust my flow?
Where must I go?
Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cuz I ain't havin no luck with this little rabbit so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlit
I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin a little scepticle
Of who I hang out with
I look like a bum
Yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army
Tryin to salvage and outfit
And it's cold
Tryin to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm only stuck in this battlin mode
My defenses are so up
And one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one
The city is no fun
There is no sun
And it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just being pulled apart
Being torn in my limbs
By each one of my friends
Enough to just make me wanna jump outta my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
Sometimes I just know not what I'm doin
I just blow
My head is a stove top
I just explode
The kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the acid I don't got
But I've learned
It's time for me to U-Turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burnt
Ain't no fallin
No next time
Imeet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid
Or be immature
I've got every ingredient
All I need is the courage
Like I already got to beat
All I need is the words
Got the urge
Suddenly its a search
Suddenly a new verse of energy has occured
Time to show these free world leaders
Three in the third
I am no longer scared now
I'm free as a bird
And I turn and cross over
The median curb
Hit the burbs and all you see is a blur on 8 mile rd.

This song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And who have no idea whats it like to be broke as fuck
Verse One:
I feel like I'm walking a tight rope, without a circus net
I'm popping perkasets, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect; but I work a sweat for this worthless check
Bout to burst this tech, at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage
Especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper
That's got my ass hyper
I pray that god answers, maybe I'll ask nicer
Watching ballers while they flossing in their pathfinders
These overnight stars becoming autograph signers
We'll all gone blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters
While playa haters turn bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money will brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
Snakes slither in the grass spineless
Chorus: repeat 2X
That's Rock Bottom
When this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's Rock Bottom
When you want something bad enough you'll steal
That's Rock Bottom
When you feel you have had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
Verse Two:
My life is full of empty promises
And broken dreams
I'm hoping things will look up
But there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of working dead end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play
Cause when we die we know were all going the same way
It's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man
Plus a luxury sedan
Too comfortable and roomy in a six
They threw me in the mix
With all these gloomy lunatics
Walk around depressed
And smoke a pound of ses a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half my life and throw the rest away
Chorus
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbing, deceitful, and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune, and the fame
That Means I'll end up burning in hell scorching in flames
That means I'm stealing your checkbook and forging your name
Lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Right now I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I got problems now everybody on my blocks got 'em
I'm screaming like those two cops when 2pac shot 'em
Holding two glocks, I hope your doors got new locks on 'em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or sock's on 'em
And them rings you wearing look like they got a few rocks on 'em
And while you flaunting them I could be taking them to shops to pawn them
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch you want 'em?
Cause I never went gold of one song
I'm running up on someone's lawns with guns drawn
Chorus

Its nothin like you guys cause I recite poetry that knowone likes
This is the night for all of us to flow to everyone and not for fun
come on now Im on its real and Ima tell you how I feel
Everyone of you punk mothafuckas see us as fake
thats a big mistake cause when your fuckin with us we cant be stopped
were on top poppin off right now whilin out
fucking with us you will be dealt with your head cut off
me and my crew arent soft you will be pissed and I also promise
to leave you dismissed along with gettin your ass kicked
were from the ROCK and where Im from you cant be seen
All of you are the downfall and you dont have the balls to come at us
Im NOTORIOUS like BIGGY and I love when fake niggas test me
I came in this game with my pockets empty and left with a roll of 20's
Theres a first time for every rhyme and every line this is mine
My 1 YEAR bid in the bin it made me a man
Doing this shit crazy while half of you amaze me
If this is nonsense to you its because you aint been through
You obviously aint been threw shit
Age 16  started hating everyone and everything cause I relized that
shit doesnt always go my way unless I got money that earns say
While the consequences every year come with fear
Cause around here you never know when death is near
This shit is really how I feel doubt me and it makes me stronger
I ts an adrenaline rush when I touch the dutch along with the mic
Around here I am well liked so fuck all of you that think Im shit
cause if there really is a real nigga Im it
I aint gonna stop till I know me and my crew are on top
of the charts and ahead of our rap game
Maintain by gettin our words of stress
Str8ght to all of your heads so you know we dont play
I pray everyday to be like me cause I know Im ready
to do this shit that I was not taught to do
My mind is my eyes that lye me to be blind
hoping to find my lyrics to make all of you fear this.

"332","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem/role_model-lyrics-10582.html","eminem","Role Model ","OK, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me!
Mic check one two.. we recordin?
I'm cancerous, so when I diss you wouldn't wanna answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangled you to death then I choked you again
Then break your fuckin legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef wit me, I'ma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer, and beat yer ass legally
I get you blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
(Ohh no!!)  So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie AND get fucked more than the President does
Hillary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fuckin tonsils out and fed her sherbet (Bitch!)
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blonde dreads (Fuck you!)
Every girl I ever went out wit is goin lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says:
smoke weed, take pills, drop outta school, kill people and drink
And jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white, I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I slap women and eat shrooms then O.D.
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold'
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed em both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (we did it!)
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his Rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray an Aerosol can up at the ozone layer (psssssssh)
My rap style's warped, I'm runnin out the morgue
witcha dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon wit a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm bout as normal as Norman Bates, with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother.. are you there?  I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone explain to my brain that I just severed
a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sighed; either I'm high, or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tiltin this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it, and dubbed over it
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me!
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably wanna grow up to be just like me!!!

I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Everytime I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit!
If I could just, put it all into all I spit
Instead of always tryin swallow it
Instead of starin' at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't, Call it Shit!
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of Mom's alcoholic fits
This is it last straw
That's all, That's it
I ain't dealin' with another fuckin' politic
I'm like a skillet bubblin', until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can fill it buildin' up
Blow this building up, I'm concealed enough
My cup runneth over I done filled it up
Then it explodes and bust, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well.. Imma show you what, You gon' feel my rush
If you don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the dutch, Im about to tear shit up
Goosebumps, Yea Imma make your hair sit up, Yea sit up
Imma tell you who I be, Imma make you hate me, Cuz you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you close-minded Fucks were to Blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee,
Out this world, there ain't no one out they mind as me
You need piece of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line, Sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feeling at that time, Yes
Sometimes, Sometimes, Sometimes
Its just sometimes is always me
How dark can these hallways be
The clock strikes midnight
1, 2, then half past 3
This half-ass rhyme, with this half-ass piece of paper
I'm desperate in my task
If I could just get the rest of this shit off my chest, Again
Stuck in this slump, Can't think of nothing
Fuck, I'm stumped, Oh Wait Here comes something, No!
Its not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzling out, thought I figured it out
Balls in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid? Why am I a slave
To this Trade? Sign not to spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up, Want me to flip it? I can rip it
any style you want. Im a switch hitter bitch Jimmy Smith aint a quitter
Imma sitter till I get enough finally hit a fuckin ' boiling point
Put some oil in your joints, Flip the coin, Bitch come get destroyed
And MC's worst dream, I make them tensed, they hate me
See me and Shape like a Chain link Fence
By the looks of em you would swear that Jaws was coming
By the screams of them you would swear Im sawin' someone
By the way they runnin', you could swear the law was comin'
Its now or never, And tonight is all or nothing
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, He said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock! Imma make them Eat this watch
Don't believe me watch! Imma win this race
And Imma come back and rub my shit in your face, Bitch!
I found my niche, You gonna fear my voice
Till your SICK of it you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream till I have half a lung
If I have half a chance, I'll grab it, Rabbit Run!

Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?

May I have your attention please,
Will the real Slim Santa please stand up.
I repeat will the real Slim Santa please stand up.
We're gonna have a problem here.
You all act like you've never seen Santa before,
Toys all over your floor, who the hell ya think brought them?
It wasn't your drunk dad or your mother that whore,
It was me and now I'm skinny and I'll tell you the score.
Its the return of Christmas but not the jolly fat elf,
my ass got so big I couldn't wipe it myself.
My doctor said, ""Santa you've never looked worse, lose 200 pounds
or your heart's gonna burst.""
Everybody loved me big and fat
ho-ho-ho,
Big ass Santa look at him walking around,
his belly like jelly, have some more eggnog.
They didn't give a fuck if my arteries clogged,
So I said fuck them and I joined a gym.
Started eatting low-fat cookies and drinking milk that was skim.
I lost so much weight I can see my candy cane,
and Mrs. Clause is happy I can fuck her again.
(Your name is on my list) x2,
and if your nice, not naughty I might give you a little gift.
But here's a message for you if your a big fat slob,
If your gut is in the way your girl won't bobble your knob.
You can't expect a hoe to gobble your goo,
if you just sit there eatting twinkies,
watching Scooby Doo.
If you ain't nothing but chubby,
no girl wants a fat hubby, you'll end
up working construction.
Your love life lies in ruins and destruction,
by the time your 30 you'll be asking Santa for liposuction.
But if your thin you'll get seduction,
underneath the mistletoe.
Sing the chorus and it goes!
I'm Slim Santa, yes I'm the real Kringle.
All you fly girls like my balls cause they jiggle,
so won't the Real Slim Santa please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up.
Cause I'm Slim Santa, yes I'm the Saint Nick.
All you other fat Santa's can suck my fat dick,
so won't the Real Slim Santa please stand up,
please stand up, please stand up.
Ho-Ho-Ho I guess theres a Slim Santa in all of us.
On Donner on Blitzen lets get the fuck out of here!

Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
{Hollywood}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
{Why do I feel this way}, sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
Sayin' goodbye, sayin' goodbye to Hollywood
[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself layin' on my knees in cuffs
Which should've been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff and just leave
How come I couldn't see this shit myself, it's just me
Nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell, to catch me
The minute shit was heated she just bailed
i'm standin' here swingin' on like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimetere when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down
Try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now i'm...
[CHORUS]
[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look
At nothin', this world's too much
I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of tylenol I would, and end it for good
Just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think i'm bottomin' out
But i'm not about to give up, I gotta get up
Thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father
So not a lot of good, i'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps of my dad
Cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass, man
If you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans, when I tell 'em i'm...
[CHORUS]
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fuckin' dick
Fuck the guns, i'm done, i'll never look at gats
If I scrap, i'll scrap like I ain't never whooped some ass
I love my fans
But no one ever puts a grasp on the fact i've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt i'd get to the level that i'm at, this is whack
This is more than I ever could of asked
everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood, or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt, i'm trapped
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, i'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' a no one to seein',
everything blow up and all you did was just grow
up emceeing
It's fuckin' crazy
Cause all I wanted was to give Hailie the life I never had
But instead I forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'...
[CHORUS]
[Outro]
Goodbye, goodbye Hollywood, {Goodbye},
please don't cry for me, when i'm gone for good, {this shit is not for me},
so goodbye, goodbye Hollywood,
{i'm not a fuckin' star}, please don't cry
for me, when I'm gone for good, {i'm goin' back home}...

[Eminem]
Yo Dre, we ridin
[Dr. Dre]
Whatever
[Eminem]
Well I'm witchu homie
[Dr. Dre]
Ok, Let's handle this small shit
[Eminem]
I was born to brew up storms 'n stir up shit
Kick up dust, cuss til I slur up spit
Grew up too quickly been through too much shit
Corrupt and now they pour it on like syrup, bitch
Thick in gritz, sick and twisted Mr. Buttersworth
Dre tole me to milk this shit for what it's worth
Till the cow just tilts and tips 'n stumbles to earth
And if I fumble the verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches, pull no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit if I ever take shit, I eat shit
Was it for him Wouldn't be shit
[Dr. Dre]
Creep wit me, as we take a little trip down Memory Lane
Been in longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
[Eminem]
But what about Jermaine
[Dr. Dre]
Fuck Jermaine, he don't belong speakin mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what your sayin
I'ma giant, and I ain't gotta move till I'm revoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
Ya midget, Mini-Me, with a buncha little Mini-You's
Runnin around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't had to do it with 10 or 11 year olds
[Chorus:]
Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh
Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it
So who you playin with huh huh huh huh
[Eminem]
Second verse, it gets worst
It gets no better than this
Amatuers drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup, if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
Will rub it in, every club your in, we'll have you
Blackballed and make sure you never rap a fucken again
Dre ain't havin it as long as Im here, play Devil's Advocate
[Dr. Dre]
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the indusrty that could save it when I'm gone
And bury to make sure the tradition carries on
I would
[Eminem]
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't, not even if I could
[Dr. Dre]
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
[Eminem]
And I'ma only sucker punch or swing without warnin
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off
Cuz I know, when they get up, I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch, I'm punk-rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white pop, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up
And sell a mil or grow up to be a tiller
Go nuts and be a killer
[Dr. Dre]
And I'm somethin of a phenom
One puff of the chron
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive, I'm on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (Come On)

Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars and alize, partyin all day
But I handle my business cuz it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I serve you gourmet
However you want it, you could have it your way
You fuck my night up, I'ma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name, sendin it your way
That goes for anyone who walks thru that doorway
Cuz this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it and you die tryin to violate it
Fuck around and you'll get anahilated
Eyes diliated
[Eminem]
Ha, like my old lady
Cuz what you say is what you say
Sometimes what you mean is 2 different things
Depending on your mood, if it swings, think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact, then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed write and my loose leaves my lanch pad
[Dr. Dre]
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything
Catch a contract on your head
You headed West, talk shit about Dre
You better get a vest, then invest in something
To protect your head and neck
[Eminem]
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth
I joke when I say I'm the best in the booth
But a lot of truth is said injest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'ma die a sudden death, 5 mics in The Source
Ain't holdin' my fuckin breath
But I suffocate for the respect
Fore I breath the collect the fuckin check
[Chorus:]
Cuz what you say is what you say
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin it

Ain't no one special, special like you (4X)
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)
Verse 1: Eminem
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving, you all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I'm imagining just us alone at last with a
touch
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me, I Love You (I love you baby)
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody Like you no where to be found

Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sex'es
We'll start it out with caviar, Don Parigne
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the herbs the Bacardi and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the Neglicie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine
She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation
You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you step away son, she got her face done
Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it
While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!!)
[Verse 2: Denaun Porter]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night
You say it's gonna stop but it.. just.. slows.. down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch..
Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said ""Oh it's like that?""
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said ""Maxine check this out,
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out""
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things""
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass""
I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok""
She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS""

"344","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem-shady_cxypher","eminem","Shady CXYPHER ","(My name is Marshall
I'm repping that motherfucking Motor City, bitch)
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet
Began to trend-set, murdered a friend's pet
Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth
Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
I'm already covered in sweat and I wasn't even ready to come in yet
AHH, let me set this drink down
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile
And ""Rap God"" was a freestyle
Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch
And I'm freestyling now
I need a towel, sweat leaks from my brow
It's burning my eyes, my cerebral is foul
Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal
I need my head banned like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio
And went to South Beach with his talents
Scream ""fuck you"" on the way out and wink with a smile
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground
But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out
Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
What the fuck is this Klusterfuk of busters
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
One swing and you're crowned
Knocked one out the park, one catchy jingle and now
You think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
Reach up, swing from a cloud with 3 thousand people around
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
And heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo
When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
Mardi Gras beads in a towel
I just made that up
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off
Between just these two amigos
Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
But I sure as fuck think I know how read body English, no doubt
Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?
Royce, he came up in the shit with me
Never spit that hustler shit, it wasn't a fit for me
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
So what in the fuck is a list to me?
I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em
Heck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out
But I could put a chain around my second album
And wear it as a neck medallion
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there
Became civil, office swivel chair, sterling silverware
Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career
The fuck am I gonna do until then? This job is too fulfilling
Two ga-jillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville
Into some children at the food pavilion and Build-A-Bear
Warrior's mind, I’m pro-hydrocodone euphoria
In the Drug Emporium line, I'm soaring
I'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler riding
Gory and violent and horrifying
You surely won't find no one more abhorring
Than I am with this retaliatory of rhyming for Gloria Steinem
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
I usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like Toucan Sam
When I said I could use the sample cause you's a tramp
But look how you react to this trigger like
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam
You're playing right in Lex Luthor's hand
It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed
In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try
Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride
And say that I'm sorry, sorry I can't apologize
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines
And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
Then I'm like dollar signs
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
Is more of a knockout than Janay Rice
Play nice, bitch, I'll punch Lana Del Rey right
In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance
Til her head is banged on the railing
Then celebrate with the Ravens
Never date an assailant who self-medicates with inhalants
I'd meditate, but I may need a better way to escape
The aggression, rage and the anger
Cause leg restraints on the ankles
Heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
This ain't just enough to contain it
But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on
Stage in a fucking negligée everyday and Liz Claiborne
Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson
Wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
Cause makeup ain't gonna cover
That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
Peppersprayed with your face cut
Made my bank like a lay up
Off these effing skanks on the way up
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven-sent
It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
Yes, I said seven, I measured it
Seven inches from the floor
While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
At the Sheradon when I'm stretching it
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
So if she's hesitant to get the hint
I'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with
Hella quick when I tell a chick not to ever use sex as a weapon
When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a crescent wrench
Existential detriment to a lesbian devil
And the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
The separatist like a Chechnian rebel
Impressionist with a pencil
A pessimist, with his lips pressed against
The edge of this Red Bull
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
SHADYXV as perplexing as
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears
And these little Disney queers
Who use chicks for beards?
Just made that up too...
Oh and the Shady 2.0
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls
Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
The flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
2 year old when I go to the studio
It's only music but don't be foolish though
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
In my homie's Buick
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do
And I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart
In one take, if I fuck up and I don't redo it
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
The day I don't say fuck you (w)all, you can throw me through it
Rootinest-tootinest, shootin' this from the hip
With the sentiments, Eminem isn't penning them for the women
I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
They tryna get rid of me gadzooks
But I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through
And if I catch you doing anything
Hindering or prohibiting that after I give me the
Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally
Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!
Fuck it
Got it somewhere in there probably, I don't know

Thinking they gon' put me in the position to pick at me

Niggaz is so gangsta, Niggaz is thugs
Niggaz'll spend their whole life peddlin drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day bein able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggaz came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggaz'll get money and pay niggaz to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cuz them niggaz just gone keep coming back

I'll punch your daddy not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you with it across your chest
[Kuniva]
It's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat your peeps down worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(Hey, hey, hey!)
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
Thats like D-Bo fightin Peablo Bryson (I'll Shit On You)
So what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out
Niggas get hit with a two piece, ""Bling Bling""
With a poisonous sting
I'm such a violent thing
Chorus
[Eminem]
Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'Till I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(C'mon, I'll Shit On You!)
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
and puts five more zainiac than maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
and spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too {*Bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misoginistic which is true
I can't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy girl dog woman man child
I'll Shit On You!
I will Shit On You I don't care who you are
I'll Shit On You
I don't give a fuck about you or your car
I'll Shit On You
Fuck your house, fuck your jewelry and fuck your watch
I'll Shit On You
I will fuck you wife if you fuck with me
I'll Shit On You
You heard me {*Eminem laughs*}
Bitch, I'll Shit On You
D-12 will Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
Your life
Your wife
Your kids
Your car
I'll Shit On You
Your house
Your spouse
Your rings
Your things
I'll Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
I'll Shit On You
I'll Shit On You

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing, it's so scary in a house that allows
no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child
And what bothers him all comes out, when he talks about
His fuckin' dad walkin' out
Cause he just hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him, so he socked him back, and broke his nose
His house is a broken home, there's no control, he just let's his emotions
go...
[Chorus]
{C'mon}, sing with me, {sing}, sing for the years
{Sing it}, sing for the laughter, sing for the tears, {c'mon)
Sing it with me, just for today, maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you
away...
[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck
can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
was a fist that hit you...
[CHORUS]
[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well can it load a gun up for you , and cock it too
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and i'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they want to get one cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves, we entertainers
Of course the shit's affectin' our sales, you ignoramus
But music is reflection of self, we just explain it, and then we get our
checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it
How we can come from practically nothing to being able to have any fuckin'
thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids, who don't have a thing
Except for a dream, and a fuckin' rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on their walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in their lives
Till they sit and they cry at night wishin' they'd die
Till they throw on a rap record and they sit, and they vibe
We're nothin' to you but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it, squeeze it and
hold it
Cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our
songs and we can...

Steps off stage, didn't think I saw her.
Creeps up behind me and she's like, you're -
I'm like, yeah I know, let's cut to the chase.
No time to waste. Back to my place.
Plus from the club to the crib's like a mile away.

And plus I got a pal. Every gal is game.
In fact he's the one singing the song that's playing! (Akon!)

Yo', never was a thug, just infatuated with guns,
never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one,
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin',
took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin',
willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death,
never live to regret what I said,
when you're me, people just want to see,
if it's true, if it's you, what you say in your rap's, what you do,
so they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill,
when they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real,
in confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation,
any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it,
if you conceal it, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you full of bullets,
pull it, squeeze it, till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies,
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze...
[Chorus:]
I'm a soldier, these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge,
i'll never fall or fold up,
i'm a soldier,
even if my collar bone's crush or crumble,
I will never slip or stumble,
i'm a soldier,
these shoulder's hold up so much, they won't budge,
i'll never fall or fold up,
i'm a soldier,
even if my collar bone's crush or crumble,
I will never stumble...
I love pissin' you off, it get's me off,
like my lawyer's, when the fuckin' judge let's me off,
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off,
i'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bet's be off,
i'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitche, it's news,
pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncers, six-two,
who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets,
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully,
it's actually better cause instead you murderin',
you can hurt em' and come back again and kick dirt at 'em,
it's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued,
you can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room,
everybody halts and stops, calls the cops,
all you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops,
runnin' and duckin' out the Hard Rocks parking lot,
you'll all get shot whether its your fault or not, cause...
[Chorus]
I spit it slow so these kids know that i'm talkin' to 'em,
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em,
i'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence,
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it,
you motherfuckers could never do it like I could do it,
don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it,
don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest,
I spit the illest shit, ever been dropped to two inch,
so ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock,
listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock,
listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen,
motherfuckers know that i'll never be Marshall again,
full of controversy until I retire my jersey,
'til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty, and
Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me,
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity, i'm a...

Aight listen ?. Sometimes you've got to turn the beat up cuz its sick
Listen ? fuck it , just let me spit?.
Yow??
Here goes ?.
Sometimes I feel like hurting the people who hurted me
Or even murder them, see
am a renegade ,revenge is what I need
am not the type who smokes weed to impress
I would smoke it cuz am depressed
But I don't need drugs to make new friends
Like all the rest of you fagots think
Sometimes am starting to scrabble shit
But just can't finish it of
And when it looks ready am trying to spit it
But keep forgetting the words
Sometimes we've got to see the difference between
Real life and music and what's on our mind
Sometimes we've got to leave the misery behind
And read between the lines
Sometimes we even got to drive trough red lights
And kill mic's we might wanna answer some questions right
Sometimes when am alone am starting to think
Why do I even exist I've got nothing to bring
And in class am the weakest link and then am starting to sing
But I want ya'll people to realize and starting to  see
that somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
sometimes when am alone I feel like quitting this life
but then I realize that it aint right
some shit reminds me of the dad I never had
why do I keep running from what I needed so bad
Sometimes I think life's a game
And everybody's a player who got
Something to bring or something to say
We got prayers, cops, waitresses even snobs
Who stink in there jobs but still get paid a lot
Sometimes life's fucked up?.
Sometimes we've got to see the difference between
Real life and music and what's on our mind

thanks a lot, next semester i'll be 35,
I smacked him in his face wit an

stapled his nuts to a stack of paper. (aaaggghh)
Walked in a strip club, had my
jacket zipped up flashed the
bartender and stuck my dick in the
tip cup.
Extra-terrestrial runnin' over pedestrians,
in a spaceship while they screamin
(let's just be friends).
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was
lied to I just found out my mom does
more dope than I do.
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous
rapper make a record about doin drugs
and name it after her.
You know you blew up wit the women

We clutch it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder
what's in store for us,
It's lust, it's torturous,
You must be a sorceress
Cause you just did the impossible:
Gained my trust,
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
Cause if I get burnt
i'ma show you what it's like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt
Before you and love is evil,
Spell it backwards I'll show you...
Nobody knows me, I'm cold,
Walk down this road all alone,
It's no one's fault but my own,
It's the path I've chosen to go,
Frozen as snow I show no emotion
Whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love
For these mufuckin hos,
Bloodsuckin succubuses,
What the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department
But I ain't had no luck with this,
It sucks but it's exactly
What I thought it would be -
Like tryin to start over,
I got a hole in my heart but
Some kind of emotional rollercoaster,
Something I won't go on
Til you toy with my emotion
So it's over,
It's like an explosion
Everytime I hold you,
Wasn't joking when I told you
You take my breathe away,
You're a supernova and I'm a...
[Chorus:]
I'm a space bound rocketship
And your heart's the moon,
And I'm aiming right at you,
Right at you...
250 thousand miles
On a clear night in June,
And I'm aiming right at you,
Right at you, right at you...
I'll do whatever it takes,
When I'm with you I get the shakes,
My body aikes when I ain't,
With you I have zero strength,
Theres no limit on how far I would go,
No boundaries, no lengths,
Why do we say that until we get
That person that we think's
Gonna be that one
And then once we get 'em
it's never the same,
You want them
when they don't want you,
Soon as they do, feelings change,
It's not a contest and I ain't
On no conquest for no mate,
I wasn't lookin but I stumbled
Onto you, must've been fate,
But so much is at stake,
What the fuck does it take?
Lets cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face,
Promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open
That I won't be makin a mistake...

I'm a space bound rocketship
And your heart's the moon,
And I'm aiming right at you,
Right at you...
250 thousand miles
On a clear night in June,
And I'm aiming right at you,
Right at you, right at you...
So after a year and 6 months
It's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts,
Never mistreated you once,
I poured my heart out to you,
Let down my guard, swear to God
I'll blow my brains in your lap,
Lay here and die in your arms,
Drop to my knees and I'm bleedin,
I'm tryin to stop you from leavin,
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm tryin to stop you from breathin,
I put both hands on your throat,
I sit on top of you squeezin
Til I snap your neck
Like a popsicle stick,
Aint no possible reason
I could think of
To let you walk up out this house
And let you live,
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks
Then I let you go and just give,
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this...
(Gunshot noise)
And I would've done anything for you
To show you how much I adored you,
But it's over now,
It's too late to save our love,
Just promise me
You'll think of me
Every time you look up in the sky
And see a star,
Cause I'm a...
[Chorus:]
I'm a space bound rocketship
and your heart's the moon
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you

And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you...

If there's any bitches in this room, then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from
[Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you outta control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates to soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more or so the chalant type, I chose
To more shows, haunted you nights I suppose
That's how it go, with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning, friends we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches the gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So whats required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire
[Chorus]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right cuz you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
[Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
Till you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you as a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who woulda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
Till you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
[Chorus]
[Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is fuck-a-bitch
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in public, we sufferin' because of this
Shorty on some whole 'notha other shit
Tryna play sick thinkin' i'mma trick off rick
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feed you the best of me, I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who coulda predicted to know, your triflin' ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I ask myself, do I love these hoes? NO!
[50 cent]
Em introduced us, ""50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
[Chorus]

I'ma clean this whole shit out like colonics,
With words put together better than Sony Electronics,
King of the jungle, humbly stay honest,
Eat with the lions, swim with piranhas,
Gasoline the seem, strike the match,
Inferno, I'm too thorough nigga so stand back,
I spit shine, get mine and rip rhymes
and make my career take an incline
I'm strict with knives, straight with razors,
Good with grenades and great with gauges
Been around the world in a million stages
Watch niggas bitch up and go through changes
I had guns before thugs was in fashion,
I mashed out before niggas knew mashin,
I knew terror before the plane started crashin,
I got punch lines and niggas ain't laughin,
[Chorus: Xzibit]
I'm gon be here after the smoke die down
Insomnia style, I won't lie down
Fight the good fight, don't need no help
Keep your hands up, defend yo self
Move like I move and live life long
Can't move up if ya heart not strong
Get'cha own shit cuz this shits mine
Every time I spit I shine
[Xzibit]
Cocksucka I preach what I practise, back shit up,
Wrap this rap shit up, still actin up,
Get found in a trunk of an Acura,
Y'all suck like jail and Dracula,
X turn up the heat, increase the hatred,
Straight stone faced don't fuck wit gay shit,
So I guess that means I can't fuck wit you now,
Two down, let off, vacate to new town,
It feel like Bishop and Juice now
Got a flame thrower that'll burn big holes through your goose down,
Rough sound, same strong background,
Been on black, the big boys layin chips down,
My whole train of thought is
to bully any mothafuckea wit problems and not get caught
I was blessed with life but I curse ta death
I'ma spit ta my very last breath - Fuck y'all!
[Chorus]
[Xzibit]
Let me give this a three second look, I hit a million dollar target
You ain't came up yet, well nigga let me show ya,
Come across dope like planes and boats,
Like balloons filled with coke down a Mexican's throat,
You ever seen a man get smoked, they shit on they self,
Their body shake for a second then it gets dissected,
For evidence of the weapon and the people involved
Let one nigga talk, everybody gettin caught fa sho',
I say that to say this (what?),
If you can't handle the time then ride the bitch,
Might as well touch ya tail and jump the fence,
Castrate ya self, expose the bitch,
X go head up, but fuck, never ran from it,
I got a gauge with buck shot that you can't stomach,
You ain't a killa, you a album filla,
You ain't a soldier, you a rap promoter, game over!

Ladies and Gentlemen,
introducing the new and improved,
you know who
Verse 1
Never been the type to bend or budge,
the wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece, you're a Maltese.
I'm a pitbull off his leash,
all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo,
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple,
Can-a-bitch don't want no beef with Slim? Noooo!
Not even on my radar,
So won't you please jump off my dick,
Lay off and stay off!
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos,
from séance to séance, aw-a-aw-sh-a-aw
Chorus (X2)
C'mon now,
Let's all get on down,
Let's do-si-do now,
We gon' have a good ol' time
Don't be scared,
Cuz there ain't nothin' to worry 'bout,
Let your hair down,
and square dance with me!
Cause you can't handle the track,
Yeah get on back,
The boogie monster of rap,
Yeah the man's back,
With a plan to ambush this bush administration,
Mush the sentence facing,
Push this generation of kids
To stand and fight for the right
To say something you might not like
This white hot light
That i'm under, no wonder
I look so sunburned
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, won't go nowhere
do-si-do oh-yo-ho hello there
Oh yeah don't think i won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till' yo muthafuckin azz gets drafted
When you're in bandcamp thinking the crap can't happen
Till you fuck around get a anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in saran wrap wrapping
Open the plastic and then you stand back gasping
Fucking assassins are jacking amtracks crashing
All this terror america demands action
Next thing you know you got uncle sam's ass asking
To join the army or what you'll do for the navy
You're just a baby getting recruited at 18
You're on a plane now eating their food and their baked beans
I'm 28 they go' take you fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy
When I say Hussien you say shady
My views ain't changed to lend humane weight
But rained two days late
The date's today hang me
Chorus x2
fuck everybody who likes this song becuz i gotta go wit my girl in
a thong. SUCK IT!
Chorus (X2)
Outro
Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me
Can-a-bitch, won't square dance with me

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad...
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn You must not have got them
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'm-a call her? I'ma
name her Bonnie.
I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him.
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan.
I even got the underground shit that you did with Scam.
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man.
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat.
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain drops on my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, with your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote,
I hope you have the chance.
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans.
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
you didn't have to, but you could have signed an autograph
for Matthew.
That's my little brother, man. He's only 6 years old.
We waited in the blistering cold for you for 4 hours
and you just said no.
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more
than I do.
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to.
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I write you
You would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way.
I never knew my father neither,
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs.
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on.
Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps
when I'm depressed.
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds.
It's like adrenaline. The Pain is such a sudden rush for me.
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you
'cause you tell it.
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7.
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does.
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up.
You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan
you'll ever lose.
Sincerely yours, Stan. PS: We should be together too.
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all

Dear Mr.  I'm too good to call or write my fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass.
It's been six months and still no word. I don't
deserve it.
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the
addresses on 'em perfect.
So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it.
I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. hey slim i drank
a 5th a vodca dare me to drive? you know that song by phil collins in
the air in the night about that guy who could've saved that other guy
from drowning but didn't and phil saw it all and at his show he found
him thats kinda how this is you could've rescued me from drowning
but its too late i'm on a thousand  gallons now i'm drowsy and all i
wanted was a lousy letter or a call i hope you know i ripped all your
pictures off the wall I loved you Slim, we could have been together.
Think about it.You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it.
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it.
I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me.
See Slim, {screaming} shut up bitch, I'm trying to talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk.
But I didn't slit her throat,
I just tied her up, see I ain't like you.
'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more,
then she'll die too.
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now.
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?
My tears so cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
the morning rain drops on my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be grey, with your picture on my wall
it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy.
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flatterd you'd call your daughter that.
And here's an autograph for your brother: I wrote it
on the Starter cap.
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you.
Don't think I did that shit intentionally, just to diss you.
but what's this shit you said about you
like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin' dog,
c'mon, how fucked up is she?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the
walls when you get down some.
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other.
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other.
Or maybe you just need to treat her better.
I hope you get to read this letter.
I just hope it reaches you in time.
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin'
just fine
If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want
you as a fan.
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit.
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago
that made me sick.
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was
pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who
it was to
Come to think about it...his name was...it was you.
Damn.

Santas loading up the sleigh
He'll come slide right down my chimney
To give some gum an? treats
I love silvers bells, and Santa's elves
It's my favorite holiday
They remind me that it's Christmas time
It's Christmas time?
Dear Santa.
How's it going? Yo it's Stan. What's up?
I wanted to send you my letter earlier
You know, to beat the Christmas rush.
I know we already spoke when I saw you at the mall
But I thought you might forget
So just bring me what I wrote on this list,
And we'll be all set.
First off, I want a Sony Playstation 2
And a bunch of games, I don't care which ones
I'll leave that up to you.
I want that Teenage Dirtbag CD by Weathus
Some hilfiger jeans and a new pair of Adidas.
Bring me a TV and a home computer.
A fat leather jacket and a razor scooter
I don't want no books I don't want no socks
I don't want none of that stuff.
I trust you Santa I know you'll hook a brother up.
Hey and listen: after delivering all those gifts
I think you're ready to party
So instead of cookies and milk
I'ma hook you up with a forty
Well, I know you got a lot to do and a lot to plan
So just beep me if you got any questions.
Yo I'm out. This is Stan.
Chorus
Dear Fat Man.
You didn't bring me nothing I asked you to!
I guess this is all some kind of sick joke to you.
Does messing with me bring you some kind of joy?
I asked you for a Playstation 2
You brang me a gameboy!
And what's up with this chemistry set that wasn't on the list g.
And what in the world makes you think I'd want Britney Spears CD?
I think you've been in the cold to long it must have froze your brain.
I specifically said no socks, I got 14 pairs, are you insane?
And where's my racer scooter, did you leave that on the shelf?
JeezeLouise Santa. Do I have to do everything myself?
You better bring me my stuff by New Year
Or next year I won't leave you none of my daddy's beer.
Do we understand each other Santa?
Good, that's what I thought.
P. S.  Tell Mrs. Claus, I think she hot.
Dear Stan.
Don't threaten me you snot-nosed little punk.
There's a very good reason I left you all that whacked junk.
I make two lists each year to separate everybody
I got one list for the nice and one list for the naughty.
In February this year you stole some cash from your mother
In March you beat the crap out of your poor little brother.
In April you skipped 3 days of school
And in May you started smoking 'cause you thought it was cool.
In June you stole a bicycle with no hesitation.
July and August, hmm? you where ok.
What, you take a vacation?
September my goodness, you made quite an impression.
Burglary, assault, misdemeanor possession.
So you see you little scumbag, there's a reason you got this.
You were at the very top on my naughty boys list.
So complain all you want about your lame Christmas gifts.
You got what you deserved.
P.S. Thanks for the Schlitz.  *burp*

Lalalalala! I love my job. Whoo! Makes me feel like Superman!
Can you fly? I can. Wanna see?
[Chorus]
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate, making you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partying
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic
So let me entertain you...
[Eminem]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought - see how long it takes to digest
Feeling good when I should be ashamed
Sh*t, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe, cause
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Just trying to seperate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it? I get sick of trying to explain it
See I could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
Cause I came here to uplift; let your woes be gone,
Tell 'em to get fu*ked and just mosie on
Constantly moving, constantly using the constitution
As a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothing less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuilding,
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids'll copy? Probably millions,
But I'ma do this as a fu*king hobby till then, cause
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fu*ked up young kids
At an alarming rate; common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate,
And mimmick every move you make - ""Slim, you great!""
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced but pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but you're jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but
[Chorus]

When I'm not at home, beating my shit to death
I'm listening to the Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff, and I'm still mad as hell...fuck you)
(Eminem)
I'm crazy with this razor with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed I'm crazy!
(Ok I'm Re-Loaded!!) Go Bring Jay-Z!!!
(Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him!!) Over Dre's Beats!!!
Ran in the ladies room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (AHHH!!)
Came in the bank with a tank, fired a blank
At the clerk and handcuffed her ankles to the safe and thanked her
But I didn't take nothing (Thanks!)
Every bullet came from the same gun
Just from different angles, cause I was pickin' strange places to aim from
(Mad Rapper: Man, I bet you 50 bucks you won't jump out the window
Shady)
(Crash) (Ahhhh!!) Pay me
(Madd Rapper)
Psych, no way fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed (Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy mothafucka might shoot me a fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go
I go loco, see me pumpin gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro mixed with cocoa
Jump turnstyles, then run from po po
Life stinks, we dont give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild ho's and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy, Slim Shady is (CRAZY!!!)

Yo yo, i wish I'd been aborted
My pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm tryin to sell a O', my pops tryin' to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs (God Dammit Spike!!!)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like...
(Eh.... Oh... Dude... That shit's crazy man... oohhhh..... This is incredible... ohhh....)
Fuck that Slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy Withe dude and u need some help, word
(Eminem)
I got a beautiful wife, kids and a gorgeous home
What would make jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight viscious I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you eight stitches, what I'm gay cause I hate bitches?
Slut dont be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And i'll still be mad at the world, even if it apoligized to me (Sorry!)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fuckin' brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch 
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George picturin' Michael Jackson 
In little boys' drawers shoppin' at toy stores **whistling**
Shady said it, Shady meant it, I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at u, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fuckin' pill mom, dont vacuum!!!

*talking gibberish*
""translation""
so you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote so suck my dick.
Two pills i pop till' my pupils swell up like two pennies
i'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
a young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew trough the last pants
I'm like a mummy at night,fightin' with bright lightnin'
frightened with 5 little white Vicadin Pills bitin' him
i'm like a fuckin' was in the hospital lost
stingin' the fuck outta everything i came across in the halls
i light a candle and place it up on a mantle
grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin' handle
so when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin'
[Swifty]it's just to late
[Eminem]Cause once you're hung from the drapes,it's curtains
[Swifty McBay]
I'm an instigator, 380 slug pentrator
degrading, creating murders to kill haters
accused for every crime known thru the equator
they knew i did it, for having blood on my gators
my weed 'll hit you're chest like a double barrel gauge
i'm like a black grenade,that 'll blow up in you're face
with a fifth of me, when i guzzle Remi, i do shit on purpose
you never hear me say ""forgive me""
i'm snatching every penny
i gotta be that way nigga, face it
that weed i sold to you brigade laced it
you high and i make the president get a facelift
niggas just afraid, handing me their bracelets
chilling in the lab,wasted
i'm the type that 'll drink Kahlua and Gin-throw up on the mic
your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
and even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight
[Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.
Cause i don't give a fuck if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick
[Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive lier, setting my preacher on fire
slash you're tires,flyin' down Fenkel and Meyers
plates expired, soon as i'm hired, i'm fired
jackin' my dick off in the bed of barb wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?)
Bitch can't you read the flyer?
special invited guest would be Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?)
Nah bitch, i'm retired
fuckin' you're bitch in the ass with a tire iron
i'm ripped, i'm on an acid trip
My Dj's in a coma for lettin' the record skip
lettin' the record skip
lettin' the record skip
(Damn!)
*Dj's schratching*
i'm fuckin' everything when i'm snortin'
it's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my Pit Bull an abortion
some bitch asked for my autograph
i called her a hore, spit beer in her face and laughed
i drop bombs like i was in Vietnam
all bitches ares hoes,even my stinkin' mom
[Kuniva]
Ay-yo flashback,2 seats,2 deep up in that ass crack
weed laced with somethin' , nigga pass that
in Amsterdam we only hang out with that hasj rats
at a 'Stop The Violence' rally i blast gats
be you're momma publishin', get you're ass capped
The Kuniva, divide up you're cash stack
raid you're motherfuckin' pockets,ASAP
i don't need a platinum chain bitch, i snatched Shaq's
born loser, half thief and half black
bring you're boys and you're guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rapper and their Jag's jacked
and find chupped up in a trash bag
[Dirty Harry]
Strangling rappers to the point they can't yell
cause their crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Wreckless, come from behind and snatch you're necklace
gruesome, and causin' more violence than 9 hoodlums
i grapple you're adam's apple until it crackle
run right past you,turn around, grab you and stab you
get executed, cause i'm a loony
i got a yuck mouth and it's polluted
i cock it back and shoot it
i love snatching up players, thugs and young ballas
shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
brigades barricade to bring the noise
while the bullets break up you're bones like Christmas Toys
if a go solo, i'm doing a song with polo
a big chinese nigga, screaming yo,yo!!!
i leave ya face leakin'
run up in church and smack the preacher while he's preachin'
take a swing at the deacon
[The Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats i sold weed and weights
i was straight until i got caught sellin' them shaped
i'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch you're rent
i got kicked out of summer camp for havin' sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
i've bin a con artist since i was swimmin' in water
in Cahoots with this nigga called Fall Out Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin' to send you a bomb (special delivery)
i signed to a local label for fun
say i got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
ride by you in the rain while you carry you're son
call you house and hang up on you for not givin' me none
born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
got a reputation for havin' niggas run up they funds
used to be the type of nigga that was full of someone's
'Til i met you're fat mama, now i'm rollin in dough
[Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.
Cause i don't giva a fuck if you don't like my shit,
cause i was high when i wrote this so suck my dick.

into a pile of elephant shit.
My lungs fell out, and stained your carpet
in the cracked mirror.(ugly bitch!)
Soft porn star,
killed with a stream of  nipple discharge
Danny hall is a tramp!
If we could wank, nob in hand,
I'd want to go
to your toilet, (your bedroom), in your basement.
I dream of being
against your mom,
my body in your nan
disappearing into you.
Words halted by the sound of breaking wind,
a gentle illusion.
A t-shirt torn by clowns is
the price of a custard pie fight.
My heart that had been in a surgical tray
in a remote part of walsall.
Those stars that hit me repeatedly in the pancreas.
cannot hide my kidney stones.
Isnt it time that you went to bed?
If i could walk,if i had legs
I'd want to go home

Look at this car, THANKS A LOT, MOM!
Here, happy birthday Rabbit,
Here's a brand-new car, you can have it
A 1928 Delta
The shit won't even get me to the shelter
And I can't even stand for MOTOWN
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now
Cause, I live at home in a trailer

Met uw handen tegen de muur, gat in de lucht,

Et er misschien iemand te veel dope gepakt?
Up't gemak, voor dat we eighties hits gaan beginnen zingen
Voor dat we de laatste druppels ut de flesse wringen,
Voor dat we alle drugs in een cocktail vermengen,
Zie je d'r gereed voor meiske
Ga je mee op stap met de pornoking?
Ei ei doe geweun uw ding.

I try to fall asleep
Sister Mary
Walking on the wall

Heading for a fall
Sister Mary
Waiting for a call
Sister Mary
Pride before a fall
So many moments
All I really neede was the one
So many moments
I have been mistreated
Playings done
Pretty soon I'm gonna run
Sister Mary
Walking on the grass
Sister Mary
Breathing on the glass
Sister Mary
Looking at the past
Sister Mary
You've got peace at last
So many moments
All I really neede was the one
So many moments
I have been mistreated
Playings done
Pretty soon I'm gonna run
Take it or leave it
'cause I don't care
you better believe it
I'm down there
Take it or leave it

Bringing dark days for you

[King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the WOOOORRRLLLD FAMOUS Wake-Up Show!
[RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue-twist, piercin holes in you
You can't escape, 70,000 kilowatts blast through your box
Woke wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in your face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP!
[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke-Up, I got the mic and never chocked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds, Killer Clown is comin
Look around, your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the midwest, leavin MC's lipless
On The Wake-Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cipher? Potna, you can't fuck wit the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirt diaper
Mic heister, psycho, alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo-gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway   Tech heard me flow and its sealed
Now I got Swedish women yelling  Tech N9NE's filled
[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit Withe-out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climped out of a nice house, 
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
Hey that's my couch, bitch!
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than flippin a convertible
Nose first wit the top off landin upside-down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway   Tech, two disk jokeys 
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject
[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum or gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, locked loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech   Sway so you can Wake-Up
The X-man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting, from high-noon to the full moon
[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assualts in small interims
As horrid as Borris Kolaf was
When I cut your neck, leave a little piece of flesh
So the head won't fall off, hauled-off
Sawed-off shotgun blast, he asked
Why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake-Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution
[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tech wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake-Up Show for those slept away
Niggas that the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the heck-AK
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit bloody decora'
Until the head of jake investigate
[Jayo Felony]
What? Sway can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you, but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!
[Chino XL]
Yo yo Chino makes the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrel did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
What flow will I destroy wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in a midst of sibling rivalry
For instance, there's nothing in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Rand-all
Wit style filed for sexual harrassment like Tisha Camp-bell
You're wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like JonBenet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg? Your demo gets passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a Withe cast on your leg
I'm Wake-Up Show reppin wit Sway   Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in
[KRS-One]
De de de de de de da di day, KRS-One comin wit the Tech   Sway
Yo, I rock up the littlest set, and on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway   a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway   Tech do
I'll be back but for now just sackle!
FRESH, FOR NINETY-NINE YOU SUCKAS!!!

He ain't got money to eat

And bought one ho-ho

Don't even risk it

Someone get him a biscuit
I don't know what they told you...Mike
You must have those corn-rows rolled too tight
This job you want to quit
but you can't
You work at this plant so long your a plant
Look at your god damn boots
For christ sake
They're starting to grow roots
When this mic can be faded
You look like a pissed off rapper who never made it
And why you fucking with the gay guy G?
When your the one with HIV
Man I'm done fuck it

u think ur hot, u think ur cute shit,
but the thing is, ur just a new kid,
I got 130 seconds to spit at ur face,
not too fast though, I gotta keep a steady pace,
ill smack ur face way back to last place,
u better try hard, this'll be ur last race,
the last guy, shit man I licked him,
u better watch out, ur my next victim,

u could probably eat a fag, whole,
u walk around, with ur pants sagged low,
ur lifes over, time to put it in the bag bro,
when its ur turn I know ur gonna freeze,
all of a sudden, it's a hundred degrees,
theres been a forest of chokers, u'll just add to the trees,
feel so bad u'll wish u were overseas,
wheres southwest when u really need it,
I come wit a warning label, bitch cant u read it,
u'll wanna stand up, ill keep you seated,
don't understand? Want me to repeat it,
u cant touch me, im too hot to handle,
u see that, I burned u like a candle,
the words gonna spread fast like the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
any word I say, it's the work of a vandal,
man Randle listen to wut I say,
u panhandle and ur gay, its ok,
urs shits so gray,
ur words r dead,
maybe itd be better if u'd just shoot urself in the head,
fill ur brain with lead,
but don't say I led ur brain to it,
tell em u finally thought ?im insane, screw it,?
tell em before u did it everybody already knew it
would happen,
so dude just stop rappin,
when ur on the mic, everybody's laughin,
and by the time ur off, everybody's nappin,
and when im on, everybody's clappin,
this shits almost done, I just gotta cap it,
this battles a tall fence, u cant hop it,
my raps off the wall, u cant top it,
so good bye nice try, im outta time,
I left u behind with a whole mountain to climb
(Chorus)

battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,
my words keep hittin,
if u like pain,
then that's wut u getting,
Wit one rhyme I terrorize a mind,
get rid of their ego and carry out a crime,
wit one line I lead one to demise,
bury their lives,
and watch them, as they internally cry,
externally die,
leave them eternally scarred, eternally marred,
and after its all over, I send them a card,
as soon as im up on the stage im fulla rage,
like a tiger in his cage,
ready to engage,
in a fight, ready to bite,
ready to turn a page,
and ready to do it every night,
ready to burn his rage, im ready,
just gimme the mic,
and watch me strike,
my words are like magic,
some endings are tragic,
they remember me for years,
my lines are classic,
u don't wanna battle me,
ur shakin,
so go home and bake urself some bacon,
I got three breasts under my chest,
but I don't understand why im under arrest,
im on a quest, to destroy everything in my way,
and if ur with me, than lemme hear u say...
(Chorus)
If I cant shoot you,
ima have to kill u by spittin,
battlin mothafuckers my ruckus aint written,
when my bullets miss,

In between the village and the

Love those characters, they're
so hard to believe
There's pretty Dick in his leather
skirt with ten Pekinese
The Brighton lights they make me feel so free
I'm driving down the London Road
To where I want to be (in Party Town)
Nothing here is quite like what it seems
Two hundred thousand people but
a million dreams
The barman's not a barman,
he thinks he's Keats
And I'm the greatest songwriter
you'll ever meet
The Brighton lights they make me

I'm driving down the London Road
To where I want to be (in Party Town)
Clubbers club round doorways hit
by strobes
Diners dine in heaven under big fat
neon globes
Gaudy bulbs on the pier, then grand chandeliers
Others sleep in doorways,
wrapped round candles and tears
Chasing love in Peter Pan
land by the sea
Hove ladies call it a dirty den of
iniquity (I agree)
Wedding cake mansions host parties

this song is for the gay one.. fuck it Just shut up and listen,
aiyyo..
I sit back with this pack of dur-ex,
and this bag of these balls,
it gives me the shit needed to be the most gayest MC,
on this...on this Earth,
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just blert,
And just blurt up this ass and bizarrea ass at work,
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension,
dispensin this constapation,
Gettin this stress that's been me eatin recently and gettin hairs on my chest,
and I rest again peacefully (peacefully)..
but at least I have the decency when Im in you to be good to ur hole,
when you freaks see me up in this hole,
when I'm eatin out or bonin your daughter to not come and speak to me (speak to
me)..
I don't know you and no,
I don't ho you are a mo-therfuck-in ugly thing I listen to N'Sync,
I am what your friends think I bum Mr. Friendly,
with my big dick after u bum me my tank is on empty (is on empty)..
No cum is in me and if you dont pleasure me I'm penetrating with my 10 feet
(with my 10 feet)..
in the air I don't care who is there and who saw me just bum you
Go call you a hooker,
file you a blow job I'll smile in the whorehouse and buy you a lap dance I'm

then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the gay I am
Sometimes I wanna feel my birds father,
I hate to feel bothered with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content thats all the songs with 'Elton' has gotten
such rotten responses""
And this penis circles me and it seems like the media immediately sticks a
finger up me (finger up me)..
So I point one back up 'em, but not the index or pinkie or the ring or the
thumb,
it's the one you put up when you just wanna fuck,
when you won't just give up till this guy just screams stop,
cause they full of cum too
When a dude's gettin bummed and screams in his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin Where were the
parents at?
And look where it's at
Straight America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper ass i-t-y havin this happenin (this
happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I cock slap this gay (cock slap this gay)..
But I'm glad cause they bum me an feed me the fuel that I need is just fired to
burn and it's burnin and I have returned

I'm so stiff and hard off bein admired that I wish that I would just fly or get
fired in

I'm not gonna be able to top  'Elton's gayness'
And bum-holed into sensation by a cockney sensation at rock'n'roll stations And
I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cockney caucasians who think
I'm some queer who just tries to hump blacks cause I talk with an accent, and
grab on their balls, so they always keep askin the same fuckin questions

The why, the up what when, the where, and the how

And everyone should get along..
Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!)
Good luck Mr. Shady
[Eminem]
Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?)
Say hi Bob! ( Hi Bob ) Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a  Dr.
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana,
and what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you
[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
[Eminem]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?)
Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
and spinal fluid is vital, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}
His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you
[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
[Eminem]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
problems among young people today, is fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off,
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee
and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't,
cause I'm bad for you
[Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]
See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)
and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)
and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
So kids say no to drugs (say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman)
Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!)
Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (Kiss my motherfuckin ass!)
so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
(So, fucked up, right now..)

Packin this third eye, pursue a cyclops
They trade in they high tops for nice sized white rocks
(excuse me) words in my right, that pass my left ear
Your style is ass-out like the bulls are next year (you're gone)
Fear this veneer, you get stung like virgins
Who that cat splurgin instead of rehearsin?
Tough guys, degentrify your high rise
Lookin more like ronald than them fuckin fry guys
Go on uptown fuckin senoritas
In taco bell screamin, ""viva gorditas!""
Bring all your dogs - I give em rabies
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies (waaah!)
Got pope john paul the 2nd, prayin to satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cookin up bacon
On barbituates with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliffs withcha, cause spinal bifida
[eminem]
My nine is liftin ya, six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended, just hop out of your whip
And leave it un-attended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
Cause I can leave your infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen, while I'm gravediggin with marilyn man?
Chorus: mr. eon, eminem
If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, i'ma take your last hit
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
I'ma snatch it outta your hand so fast i'ma detach it
So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, i'ma take your last hit

Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it

I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez
The quickening, did a bris at the christening
I'm exercisin, doing liftings and twistings
Instinct's the nicest, I keep tellin you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been sellin you?
[eminem]
(here - buy this) I'm e-mailin you, at the wrong website
And mispellin you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you
Escaped bellevue, stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim shady, a perverted version of birth
Drivin off, leaving a murdered virgin at church
The first person who searchin the earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they shoulda alerted the surgeon first
(kill his ass) get thrown curves, and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm takin off both shoes and stickin each middle toe up

These ideas are nightmares for white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
Its so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he dont care
He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin out
Cos he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
But if he ever saw him again, he'd prolly knock him out
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, 2 rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
Come on...
[Chorus:]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me,just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Verse #2]
Entertainment is danger, intertwine it with gansters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or Unholy, only have one homey
Only this gun, lonely, cuz don't anyone know me
But everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrate, or even worse, they can teach hate
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphasis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you

The whole damn world has gone insane
Half dosed up with atropine
The rest prepared to get gangrene
All made out to be routine
By politicians and magazines
Saying 'we're gonna smash an evil
regime'
'Evil regime, Saddam Hussein'
And millions stuck in-between
Shots and bombs and fusilenes
And Tony Benn's our go-between
But what the fuck hope can Iraqis see
Jesse Jackson:
'It's hope time, it's healing time
It's hope time, it's healing time'
The only Gods that we adore
Are love and peace and plenty
We're better pleased to make one more
Than be the death of twenty
Come on baby, let's make 1 more
Tony Benn:
'It must be about democracy'
Dear God, where's your
miraculous deed
You've got to act now, don't mess
around no more
The world's heating up for a badass
war
And the deal is they trash the poor
While dictators hide and the rich
get more
And it's so awful but it's not unlawful
Cause the resolutions are sealed n signed
And the world feels like it's down
upside
And singing raps is so naive
War is sick; Bush is thick;
He's a hick; Saddam's a prick;
Let's cause a war,
ie mass destruction
That's the so called sane instruction
To remove the weapons of mass destruction
To me that's just some mad corruption

Than be the death of twenty
Come on baby, let's make 1 more
So Dear God, get your ass down here
You've got to murder hate and
kill the war
You've got to burn intolerance
and impose peace
So God, this could be your
masterpiece
No more scorn for things gone wrong
You can live up to the hype
and redress the wrongs
Fight the good fight with all your might
And let the puppet world leaders know who's right
So Dear God, whatever you are
Jesus or Allah or a superstar
Share out the oil and save the poor
Spare the kids and spoil the rods
You could start again and set
new laws
Get some rappers in charge with
morality
Tougher than rhinos but sane, you'll
see
All they'll murder is some crass old rhyme
But they won't curdle the milk of humankind
Until we're all turned into rivers
of slime
No
The new wars would be battle raps
A new world order of baseball caps
American and Islamic too
The new world language would
start with booo
Boo hoo hoo hoo, boo hoo hoo
That's where we are heading to
The only Gods that we adore
Are love and peace and plenty
We're better pleased to make
one more
Than be the death of twenty
Come on baby, let's make 1 more
So Dear God, you've got to intervene
I think I've just gone insane
I want to fight war with my bare fists
I want to kill hate, do you get the gist'
And I'm ****** off with pacifists
'Cause what have they been doing all these goddamn years
Letting bullies and puppets
walk over us'
So God, have you had your fill
Thou shalt make love
Thou shalt not kill

Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who, yeah, but he's so cute though
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?
We ain't nothing but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the anecdote
Women wave your panty-hoes, sing the chorus and it goes
1-    I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up?
Please stand up, please stand up

So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear them argue over who she gave head to first
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee
I should download her audio on MP3 and show the whole world
how you gave Eminem VD

I just get on a mic and spit it and whether you like to admit it
I just shitted better than 90 percent of you rappers out there
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums
It's funny cuz at the rate I'm going when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerkin'but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King spitting on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming  I don't give a fuck!
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta ya mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

Its all bad now man, its all bad
But yal done fucked up now
Yeah ha ha, new shit, hey yo
I just want the whole world to know:
That I did not start this, but I will finish it
[Verse]
Comin up it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit then you could spit, thats it, thats what it was
Back when, motherf*ckers was straight back packin
Cypherin, fightin for life in this rap
for the mic to get past and you psyched and you gasped
and you hyped cuz you last and you might whoop some ass
If you lost then you lost shake hands like a man
and you swallowed it, when the unsigned hype column
at The Source was like, the only source of light
When the mics used to mean somethin, a four was like
you were the ****, now its like the least you get
three and a half now just means you a peice of ****
four and a half or five, means you Biggie, Jigga, Nas,
or Benzino I dont think you even realize
you playin with motherf*ckers lives, I dont watched Dre
get ****ed on The Chronic, probably cuz I was on it
Now you f*cked me outa my mics twice I let it slide
I said I wouldnt hold my f*cken breathto get a five
Sh*t I was right, Ida f*ckin died already tryin
I swear to God I never lie I bet thats why
you let that b*tch give me that bullsh*t review
I sat and took it, I aint look at the sh*t we knew
You'd probly try to f*ck us with Obie and 50 too
F*ck a relationship we through
No more Source with street cred, them days is dead
Dre's got A-Ks to dave mase's head
Every issue there's an eight page Made-Mens spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid, hes just a f*ckin waste of lead
on my pencil, for me to write some sh*t this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This old Gs bout to get smoked like raw weed
You dont know me or my motherf*ckin mother you motherf*ckin punk
Put me on your motherf*ckin cover to sell your little sell out mag
I aint mad I feel bad, heres an ad, heres a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some sh*t that you dont know about? ya
Lets talk about how your puttin you own son out there
To try to eat off him, cuz you missed your boat
Your never gonna float b*tch your just too old
No wonder your sore now lordy your bored now
Im pushin thirty your kickin fourty's door down
B*tch this is war now, and youl never beat me
all you do is cheat me out of quatables but you know
that youl always see me on your TV
Cuz you gotta stay up till three in the mornin
To see your video played once on BET
So he-he-he who gets the last laugh?
Aftermath ya so on behalf on our whole staff
kiss our ass-hole cracks we'll never fold or hold back
Just know that Benzinos wack
no matter how many times I say his name, hell never blow jack
Your better off tryin to bring R-S-O back
Look at your track record thats how far it goes back
Its extortion n Ray own's a proportion
so half of the staff up there is fresh outta jail from boston
Bullyin and bossin, caged like a slave they've completely brainwashed him
And forced him to stay locked in his own office afraid of the softest
fakest, wannabe gangster in New York
And its pitiful, cuz I never woulda said sh*t to you if you'd kept your mouth shut
B*tch now what? Hit a clue, spit it slay
New sh*t, exclusive ?? whoo kid
You know what to do with this: use it
Im through, this is stupid, I cant believe I stooped to this
bullsh*t to do this...
And who you callin a b*tch? B*tch. You owe me.

The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide..
[Dr. Dre]
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
I got a {blunt} rolled
Feelin bold, gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
but I'ma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
[Eminem]
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
but I know you - the name's Slim - you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
Chorus: {unknown singer}
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
[Dr. Dre] + (Eminem)
He was ""Shady,"" I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces {shit} I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My {shit} went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
(Eminem)
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin]
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
[Dr. Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a ""G Thang,""
and a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin""
I said ""It's Dre's Day,"" and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way
(Eminem)
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a {blunt} that's rolled
Chorus 2X
Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide..

Spittin like I don't care

Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the hoe now
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk

Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up Withe rappers like im throwin gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room

When your pukus, turnin to yellow with orange mukus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally
I'll take it back before we do each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started
Cock block your fathers game
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle

she gives you a raw beating for leaving

then shit gets heated hotter than a hot oven
cos you've broken bonds
kissed others with open tongs
being disloyal
like whats been planted in this soil
but this is all i've herd
how they cheat and end up dead from their bird
so if you blare a word of cheating
you havent put one foot in
you've stook both feet in
then you start watching your back from day one

Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts

Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like Tupac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after i do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two rotts
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizza's, now i got twelve visa's
So tell jesus I'm gonna quit sinning when hell freezes
[chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
Yo I use to be to heavy in that cruising rap shit crap
I think i fucked my head up listing to acid rap
I go to party's bumping nasty nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and i stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced aint, it taste tainted
Your whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like sci-fi t.v
Fuck ICP buy my cd
cause while I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Aint no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth
[chorus]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probley why my nights are getting colder and my day seems shorter
But as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and i keep growing older
I be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
Uh, uh uh uh uh

[Intro:]
Cause sometimes you just feel tired.
You feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up.
But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you and get that motivation to not give up
and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse.
[B/W Intro:]
Go left, go left, go left right left
Go left, go left, go left right left
Go left, go left, go left right left
Go left, go left, go left right left
[Verse #1:]
Till I collapse I’m spilling these raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop you’ll never say that I’m not killing them
Cause when I am not then I am stop pinning them
And I am not hip-hop and I’m just not Eminem.
Subliminal thoughts when I’m stop sending them women are caught in webs spin and hauk venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illing to stop. Amoxacilin is just not real
enough.
The criminal cop killing hip-hop filling minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners.
Your coming with me, feel it or not you’re gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of god
lives in us.
You hear it a lot, lyrics the shock is it a miracle or am I just a product of pop fizzing up.
For shizzle my whizzle this is the plot listen up you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a
fuck.
[Chorus - NateDogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I’ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can’t shut my mouth.
Till the smoke clears out and my high wear out
I’ma rip this shit till my bone collapse.
[Verse #2:]
Music is like magic there’s a certain feeling you get when your real
and you spit and people are feeling your shit.
This is your moment and every single minute you spend trying to hold onto it
cause you may never get it again.
So while you’re in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end.
Cause I’m at the end of my wits with half this shit that gets in.
I got a list here’s the order of my list that it’s in.
It goes, Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie, Andre from Outcast, Jada, Kurupt,
Nas and then me. But in this industry I’m the cause of a lot of envy,
so when I’m not put on this list the shit does not offend me.
That’s why you see me walk around like nothing’s bothering me.
Even though half you people got a fucken problem with me.
You hate it but you know respect you’ve got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney. Nate hit me.
[Chorus - NateDogg]
[Verse #3:]
Soon as a verse starts I eat it at MC’s heart
what is he thinking I'ma not to go against me, smart.
And its absurd how people hang on every word.
I’ll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I’ll never be served my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave earth that would be the death of me first.
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse.
That’s why I’m clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I’m an addict
I rap like I’m addicted to smack like I’m Kim Mathers.
But I don’t want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bump some rappers.
So this is like a full blown attack I’m launching at them
The track is on some battling raps who want some static
Cause I don’t really think that the fact that I’m Slim matters
A plaque of platinum status is whack if I’m not the baddest.
[Chorus - NateDogg]
[Outro:]
[Eminem & Natedogg Echo:]
Until the roof
The roof comes off
Until my legs
give out form underneath me
[Eminem:]
I will not fall,
I will stand tall,
Feels like no one could beat me.

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight
[Verse 1:]
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Druggling thugs, smuggling drugs, juggling jobs, guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts, huh
We travel in packs and ravel in facts and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max, gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab in the backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet, I carried on my back
Butterfingers is here and it's necessary to scratch it
Baby all I wanna do is swallow one and two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience
[Chorus:]
[Women Singing:]
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)
[Eminem:]
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[Verse 2:]
Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandealous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this, I'm the rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think a living never meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread interamentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Come battle me and you get smacked as hard as you act
When I rap I represent it and will never referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented, come up with funk, I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly said it
[Chorus:]
[Women Singing:]
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)

We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feeling uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
Till the morning light hope that everyone's feeling alright
[Verse 3:]
Eminem is heading skyward
For those who thought that I would make you bored and treat you like a piece
of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a dis, cause you don't posses the pizzazz as this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire
I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantic
Freaking the vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here, just be like
[Chorus:]

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight (blends in with lyrics)

step into my clique the wrong way
and get your motherfucking dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shooting niggaz
we buckin bitches
[Bizarre]
My fully loaded nine will shoot throguh your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores(AHHHH)
Battle bizarre and its just to deadly
Even a rapper with a legion who met me still could forget me
If i don't get all my fucking dough
Ya'll gonna see more fights and spits then the Jerry Springer show
Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
But ????? even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his polo
I'm the reason nigga's come ten deep and end up leavig solo
Meet losing ya'll nigga's must be bugging
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns
[Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill greasy and heated
smothered in hot mustard
so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated while you breathin
or you'll be leaving the recevin room this eveing with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin on eight corners swarmin ya hood
With a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a jeep and slam on the gas and charge you
and bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Flotin around drowned face down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up
to the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and piledrive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he drives by me at 90 mph
This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out
cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
[Fuzz]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips, yeah, she get it
The same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passing clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has more whores then ????
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin foes
Telepathly harrasing foes
I know your little sister is four-teen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titantic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they asking for
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show you passing one blunt
Bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to keep his head up
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like bitch come and pick this bitch up
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb

Fred Durst: Check! Slim Shady, do the mic. kid
(Eminem)
I don't do black music
I don't do Withe music
I make fight music
For High School kids
I pull side full grips 
When I drive like this {screech}
With a slipped disk
From a Limp Bizkit diss
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs
Don't attempt this shit 
Just step back
While I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I said to the girl, I'm like
""What up girl?""
""Shut up girl!""
And showed her a cut-up squirrel
She screamed bloody murder so loud everybody heard her
Slapped me in the mouth and called me a nutty murderer
I moved on to two blondes 
And kissed 'em on a futon
{Ay yo baby!}
{What do you want?!}
I looked at 'em both and I was like
""Look, check this out toots, I'm lookin' for cookie pus""
I need to speak to 'em immediately
They played my video on MTV last week
And just when I was thinkin' I was all that and then some
In comes Fred Durst
(Fred Durst)
Yo Shady let me get some
Who knows what galaxy I came from
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair 
Now I'm a nightmare
You stay right there
I got the diva 
Hold the flavor of a single
See me and Shady?
I think we got a lock down
Shocked by the sound
I got you cruisin' with your top down
These two blondes
I offered 'em both a drink
And this you would think
Could get the party started
But instead them girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouths
Smelt like somebody farted
So if it's time for me to move on
Shady said the livin' room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick
Bumped into this dude who was drunk
And a prick 
Ramblin' on about how
He was gonna kill me
Wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no- He insisted we should go
Before I could drop 'em
Shady had to clock 'em
The music stopped
The party stood in shock
So I looked around
Grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
But don't you 
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
This party's goin' my way
Or no way at all
(Eminem)
Turn me loose
You better tell 'em to come re-shingle the roof
Just keep feedin' me free drinks till I puke
And Fred'll ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sick at the barn
I'm not bein' approached
Cuz Fred's over there stealin' all of my hoes
{Yo Fred save me some}
I walked up to these saimese twins
And asked to have a threesome
Told 'em two heads are better that one
Plus I respect how y'all roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin 
Stood up like ""Ay wait, where you goin"" {bye!}
Oh well
Three strikes and I'm out
I struck out and stood tied to the road {ouch} 
I ain't tryin' no more
Fuck it- I'm chillin'
Get a shot of yable {ahhh}
Fell asleep on the ceiling

I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it

[Eminem]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!
[Chorus Three]
{Just let it gooo!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it

My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a ""Role Model,"" I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that ""Just the Two of Us"" would make you hate me this much
And ""Just the Two of Us,"" that ain't got shit to do with us
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!
[Chorus Two]

Translation
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick - ha ha!
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can strapped to the back of his ass
so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin with bright lightning
Frightened with five little white Vicadin pills bitin him
I'm like a fuckin wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fuckin handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurtin
[Swifty] Bitch it's too late
[Eminem] Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
[Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degradin, creatin murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it (uh-huh) for havin blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit yo' chest like a double barrel gauge an'
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in yo' face [*BLAM*]
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say, ""Forgive me""
I'm snatchin every penny - it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggaz just afraid, handin me they bracelets
Chillin in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin - throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight
[Chorus: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit

I'm a compulsive liar, settin my preacher on fire
Slashin your tires, flyin down Fenkel and Meyers
Plates expired, soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jackin my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing?) Bitch didn't you read the flyer?
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer?) Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fuckin your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for lettin the record skip.. [*needle pops*]
Lettin the record skip.. [*needle pops*]
Lettin the record skip.. [*needle pops*] (Damn!)
[*DJ reverses the record and scratches it back on beat*]
I'm fuckin anything when I'm snortin
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pit bull an abortion
[*dog whines*] Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin ass mom
[Proof]
Aiyyo flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with somethin [*gun cocks*] nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a 'Stop the Violence' rally, I blast gats
Be your mom on publishin, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain, bitch I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half theif and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers get they Jag jacked
and found chopped up in a trash bag
[Kuniva]
We stranglin rappers until the point they can't yell
cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cuz I'm a ""Luni""
I got a ""Yukmouth"" and it's polluted
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatchin up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin ""Kuniva yo yo..""
I leave ya face leakin, run up in church
and smack the preacher while he's preachin
Take a swing at the deacon
[Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught sellin em shake
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for havin sex in my tent
with the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery!) I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Driveby you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not givin me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggaz runnin they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was foldin some one's
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rollin in dough
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Haha.. suck my motherfuckin dick
D-12.. Dirty motherfuckin Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre kid
Swifty McVeigh
The Kon Artis
The Kuniva
Dirty Harry
Haha, and Slim Shady..

How can I explain this?
How can I swing this, in English language?
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
do I do it in vein, or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water
Woady on my daughter I told you I love this culture
don't let em insult ya, I'ma tell you one more ?gain

to get rid of some frustration, or should I say shon
this is just another one of my subliminal ways to racism
you're face is numb, you're stunned you look as cold
like that of a man who's 70 some years old
and it only gets colder, which is why I understand
it can't be mad at a forty four fan
with a chip on his shoulder
who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
is to put me on the front of it again
only think that makes him grin, is to see me frown
papa can't stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
in his new chair that goes round and round
that he bought from new money of his bank account
that I get him every issue when the thang comes out
sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
and let his black side arm wrestle his white side
yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
he might find someone dumb enough who might ride
but aint nobody over here buying two white guys
disguised as pro-black there's no slack for a Hartford college grad.
In a fitted hat and a hunch bag, standing by the clearance coat rack
And some RSO throwbacks, yeah

Still knockin' a K to these punks, fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips hatin' mixed cunts!

To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip
His plams are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now
The clocks run out, times up over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy
No
He won't have it , he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It dont matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, thats when it's
Back to the lab again yo
This whole rap city
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
HOOK: (x2)
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order
A normal life is borin, but superstardoms close to post mortem
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
HOOK (x2)
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, theres no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonnor caught up bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama screamin on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salems lot
So here I go its my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got

to fight for your country will you fight
or will you go down with no honor
oh his palms are sweaty
guns slippen all ready
there nervous but on the surface
they look calm and ready to drop bombs
While looken at the flag
the whole land goes so loud
everybody openthere ears right now to go check it out but
clock's run out times up over blow
snap back to reality op there goes everybody
they now there whole life is on the line
but it don't matter
the front line goes to the ground
they now there going so down
everybody is screaming now
so the better go capture this moment
and go kill every man they got

Ha ha! [echoes]
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
It's like a throne that he dont even own
He wont sit down, given the crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport
Runnin suckaz with the competition round the court
He appreciates your support but he aint beggin for it
And you cant love it you can hate it but you cant ignore it
You cant be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you cant fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It

He's straight outta the neighborhood but Niggaz hate
They see you go and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Your stomachs ache while he's loungin at the big estate
And he hops in a 100 thousands with a Nigga's gate
House with just a bigger gate , houndin him's a big mistake
He wont surrender he'd rather give up a rib to break
Cuz he remember when they wouldnt lend a helpin hand
So he was sittin on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz so when you gotta mention his name
When you discuss him the illest playa that's in the game
And he's ridin with Em, 50 cent, Doc and them
G Unit records aint no motherfuckin stoppin them

I hit harder
Than Forman
Landing both both gloves to a low blow
With no cup
Leave you Speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls
Through helmets
With the penetration of a screw nailed in
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles, we pour blood
And toast, death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps
Slaughter lamb
And boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness
And mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure
Language unfam-i-liar
Art through a flooded air brush
??? leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands
It's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landing
In exact time flight leaves
Watch this
Watch this
Watch this
Don't watch that, watch this
(Eminem):
Who's arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
And refused to resume my severed prescription of ???
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich
And just ate the knife
My mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ'
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice
Bugs fallin' out of my head
I'm wishin' I was dead
While I'm crawlin out of my bed
Found it red
And my rash is returning
I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine
Screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'
These pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'
The devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me

Whatever...
Dre, just let it run
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit
Aiyyo... this song is for anyone... fuck it
Just shut up and listen, aiyyo...
I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this - on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)...
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
Do not come and speak to me (speak to me)...
I don't know you and no,
I don't owe you a motherfucking thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tick me my tank is on empty (is on empty)...
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet (lifting you 10 feet)... in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you (of all you)...
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me
[Chorus:]
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
Sometimes I just feel like my father,
I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content -
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses""
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)...
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn)... and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city
Having this happening (this happening)...
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)...
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned
[Chorus:]
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name is... ""
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
That got me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)...
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'cause I talk
With an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep asking
The same fucking questions (fucking questions)...
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how
'Til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they driving me crazy (driving me crazy)... I can't take it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit, in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad
[Chorus:]
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam
'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news everyday I am
I don't know it's just the way I am

Ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength
Of Aftermath straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game b!tch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go
[Verse 1 - The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'em erases
They say shit but fuck them,
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was
We started throwin cinthi and decided to chase 'em
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say, step in the booth in one take and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit, Em they ain't gon' like this

So they callin us
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you

Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Your mind's lost, you are not ready to make that flame switch
You will end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waiving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass, and if that's the case, then we ain't going...
[Chorus:]
[The Game]
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you

Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Eminem just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'ma do Shady numbers, I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody on my under the pennalton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimmy Hendrix, I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
>From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a glock that don't phase me,
I'm crazy why you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me, I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks
[Chorus]
So I'm gone bitch
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you

This day the game won't ever be the same

Niggas Know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
but if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day
[Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna look
like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes
everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
O's an animals skirts get mirked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
trust in guard it cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
keep this a secret right by the nuts
a 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck
[Chorus]
[Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
and make my cash stretch longer than giraff necks
poverty will make your ass bet on words
touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
they say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
if that's the case then get a bigga one
you don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the hood
that's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I where a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
living lavash, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going back and forth
your boss and your captain's soft
[Chorus]

We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gonna get it
name em we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out
too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose
my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assasins
ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning
disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs

we are not killers, my vato will have you shot-o
drag through the varrio and fucked like Kim Osario
litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real

with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs

I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hindoff
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sindoff
Nobody told you that I'm loco essey?

have you gasping for breath after that shit under your vest
fear me like you fear god cause I bring death
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
I watch gansta flicks and root for the badguy
and turn it off before it ends cause the badguy die

so what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
you can raise your voice like you fending to touch something

Niggas Know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You can run your mouth I don't care
but if you get too close I'm gonna clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga is gonna do whatever he has to
A man is the last thing you should fear
it ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day
[Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in the bar, faggots wanna loot
like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'm gonna stand here as a man and
let some queer ass funny looking nigga get the upper hand
I got issues, got no time, got guns that mourn nigga's moms
shoot up clubs and destroy nigga's vibes
everybody running for their motherfucking lives
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
open up your fade, your grey brain meets motor city pave
your nervous system still twitch off Jay Z
O's an animals skirts get mirked
don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
don't ever let a nigga tell you play the bar hard
trust in guard it cause you're about to catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from who you be with
keep this a secret right by the nuts
a 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make me not give a fuck
[Chorus]
[Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
and make my cash stretch longer than giraff necks
poverty will make your ass bet on words
touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish their last sents'
they say you live by the gun and die by the next nigga gun
if that's the case then get a bigga one
you don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out of the hood
that's a stereotype like everyone that's black can jump
I where a white mink, the fabric is done
got rings that bling like Mike, Byrd, Magic and them
out in Dallas in a palace where the Mavericks is from
living lavash, I'm established, so the cabbage'll come
I'm the clouds you won't see me in the trains
I travel first class you don't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name, cause I don't going back and forth
your boss and your captain's soft
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gonna get it
man we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out
too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gonna fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum movin in my direction to lose
my shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in 'em (BROOM)
you know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie we all move like assasins
ski masks and gloves consider this as a warning
disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask Muggs
but we are fizast, fuck your litte bitch ass up
we are not killers, my vato will have you shot though
drag through the varrio and fucked like Kim Osario
litte sorry hoe ass, go ask B Real
we burn source covers like fuckin Cypress Hill
did in the 90s, when you was in diapers still
shady records you better believe the hype is real
this is no joke, I don't smoke
but I toke enuff second hand to make my fuckin P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fuckin with a GI Joe
Bia Bia, mia meo a vida loco
I'm a psycho, Mariah aint got shit on me
when I retire I'll be spittin baby food on people
a tent sieged on her ranch, huddled up next to her
with Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
you ever had your cat pealed back or your shit pushed in
I put my blade in your like a fucking pin cushion
slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Henn dogg
I'll show you how to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
Nobody told you that I'm loco essay?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm slim sha...dy and the  d  is for deez nuts
and you can get each one for free so feast up
I pee in a cup for three months, I'm having an E party for easter please come
[50 Cent]
We gonna bring it to anybody who want it
you want it? you gonna get it
man we gon hit em, chew em up and spit em out
too much venom and if you role with 'em
we gonna fuck you up with 'em
you can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a 12 gauge mossbert to pump up your chest
have you gasping for breath after that shell hit your vest
fear me like you fear god cause I bring death
Silverback gorrilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest one around you know how I get down
I watch gansta flicks and root for the badguy
and turn it off before it ends cause the badguy die
if you trying to buy guns I'm the nigga to look to
so what they got bodies on 'em, they still look new
you can raise your voice like you fending to touch something
when I raise my knife shit I'm fending to cut something
see I walk like Ron O'Neil and talk like Goldie
if the bitch think I love her the bitch don't know me
(haha Sorry Kim haha)
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Souls Assasins y'all
What up Muggs?
[DJ Muggs]
What up Em?
[Eminem]
We outta here...

There's an intruder
in my house
He cut my phone-lines
can't dial out
I scream for police
but I doubt
They're gonna hear me
when I shout
[rapping]
A couple of cocktails will send me to jail
there's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
there's a doberman pinscher and a pitbull in the seat
these pigs 'll get bit fooling with me
quit fooling with me
Bitch, you're gonna see
No pistol in the seat
why it always gotta be an issue when you're me
and which you're gonna see in the long run
Im'a be the wrong one
you wanna harass with this limo tinted glass
flashin that flash-light on my ass where was you at
last night when them assholes
ran up on my grass
rapper slash actor
kiss the crack on my cracker slashed ass
they took away my right to bear arms
what I'm posed to fight with bear palms?
yeah right
they coming with bombs, I'm comin with flare-guns
We as americans

Us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves

Im'a make Vuku bucks

Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I could've been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
but you know who
whith an ""S"" tatooed to my chest
But I've innested
Now I got the Industry pissy
eversince me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on fifty it's funny
We got a buzz spreading quicker than making paper-airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the president dead
It's never been said
but I said precedents and the standards
and they can't stand it
My name should've been bastard
the shit should've been plastered
on my forehead with a stamp
I should've been blasted
I should've been had a cap pulled in my ass
but I'm too swift and fast
for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot
Fuck that shit
I done seen a fastest rap shit
and turning into some pap-pap shit

I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two Nina's under my jeans either side of my penis
under my Long Johns
under my Sean Johns
when running with the long arm or the long long gone
Im'a do five years or less than that
no questions asked
it might be a good idea to stop right here
and quit while I'm ahead
already in the red
already got a steady infrared nipped on my head
A target on my back
bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass
he probly gone send a task
I ain't gone even ask
they ain't gone let me pack
they ain't gone gimme my semi but I got my Whizz at

I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit sooner or later
You little haters are too jellous of us to love us

You sick to your stomach

Don't even consider takin our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't tryin to get too intriqette into it
I'm just tryin to give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cuz then it's gunna get to the point where it escalates into some other shit
Then Im a flip
Then Im a get to stompin in my Air Force One's
Won't be able to tell if it's two pairs or it's one
It's gunna feel like there's so many feet kickin you
You think that Nike just made these into cleat tennis shoes
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussy's try to push me
Thinkin they gon' put me in the position to pickle me
Ya'll tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have pink tiggle me

Mixed with a little bit of the ???

Teats and Thurston Howell, and yelling Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves
You wanna be the one to step up and get served first
99% of aliens prefer Earth
Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters, runnin together and blurs spurts
Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts
I point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers
My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse
Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert
Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse!
You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse!

So who am I gonna call on when I ain't got them boys with me
And the situation gets a little sticky
I'ma dial 911 like a motherfuckin' punk, fuck that, bla bla
I'ma call that rude boy from Detroit, Trick Trick
Quick come pick me up, bring them guns
Come to the club, meet me out front
There's some chump up in this bitch
Poppin' some junk cause he's drunk
And we may have to fuck his ass up
Cause uh, somethin' smells a lil' fishy
And I don't like the way his boys keep lookin' at me

Elected to be the villain and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game, I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house

Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it

I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes

Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
**sounds of steps**
Hey yo Stick, Stick
[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmah..
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dreah..
Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
Verse One : Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes
The whole shibang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin me
(Can I get your autograph?)
Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
I wouldn't need caladeral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)
Chorus: Eminem
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was
white, white, white, white, white,(STICKyyyy what if you were white?) white, white,
white, white, white?
Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, prepi or high class?
YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILERPARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!
In any case that be ill shit right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad out of being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight
(What's UP MY BROTHER?)
True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
Even if I was white
Plaque still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)
Is it a minfo
Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white
I would probably listen to hardcore rock
and covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (What if he was white?)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white

Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
Yo,yo,yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
I be serice sippin vadka and tonixs
Smokin on them all on a marboral
instead of a nueport
I live in Long Island
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk
Cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the trees spots
Cuz all the niggas trend think I was a cop
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?(Yo you can't say that)
What if he was white
What if he was

What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?

What - If - He - Was - White?

Back when Cube - was rollin wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business; but sometimes
the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cuz you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein real wit you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool wit
Then I got these fake-ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin that they non-violent, talkin like they *voice sample*
Spit venom in interviews, speakin on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speakin your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
Chorus: Phish (repeat 2X)
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one - but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin big dog style and straight coastin
[Xzibit]
Yo I stay wit it
While you try to perpetrate, play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (YEAH)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick
(Yeah!) Come and get it, shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid - never come down
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference
Chorus
[Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up!
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE!! I got somethin to say
Dre; I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin weed is in me
(The fuck?!) I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin back, just know this shit
[Dre] Riiight? .. Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
[Em] I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed - who's throat is it?
[Dre] Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
[Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (Hi!) Then drop her off on the corner
at the police station and drive off honkin the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
and they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even THINKIN of havin them thoughts thought up!
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up!!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it!

"451","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/eminem-when_im_gone","eminem","When I'm Gone ","[Intro]
Yeah
It's my life
In my own words, I guess
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
""Daddy look what I made"", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
""Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?""
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby
[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
""You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?""
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, ""Daddy you're lying
""You always say that, you always say this is the last time
""But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine""
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
""Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!""
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, ""this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'""
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying ""You've got one more chance to do right"" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
""Daddy it's me, Help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding""
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
""I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
""You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin""
""I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone""
But baby wait, ""it's too late Dad, you made the choice
""Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us""
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream ""Die Shady!"" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
[Hook]
*Curtains Closing*

Music, reality, sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psyche!
[Eminem:]
If I were to die murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
Or would it matter
Can never be the lead-off batter of things
Shit for me to feed off
I'm see-saw battlin
But theres way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
And I came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for a joke you smokin crack
Before I do that, I beg Mariah to take me back
I get up 'for i get down, run myself in the ground, 'for I put some wack shit out
I'm tryin-a smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Ya'll steady tryin to drown the shark
Ain't gonna do nothin but piss me off
Lid to the can of whoop ass, just twist me off
See me leap out, pull the piece out, fuck shootin i'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you're really feeling froggish, leap
Yo slim, you gonna let him get away with that
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that
Man I hate this crap, this ain't rap,
This is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
[Swift:]
There ain't no getting rid of McVeigh
If so you woulda tried
The only way I'm leavin this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemy's crib with hennesy,
Got drunk then I finished he
I'm every nigga's favorite arch-enemy.
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark dilligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up
Mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigger had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres
I murder you
Danger had me turned into a mad man, son of sam, bitch, I'm surgical
I'l allergic to dyin, you think not you got balls We can see how large
When the music stops
[Kon Artist:]
I was happy having a deal at first,
Thought money would make me happy but
It only made my pain worst,
It hurts when u see ur friends turn their back on u dawg
When u ain't got nothing left but ur word and ur balls
N ur stress full of cause
Of ur new friends they beggin with their hands out
Checking for ur record when its selling
When it aint, that's the end, no laughs
No friends no girl
Just the gin u drink till u car spin u then
[Screech]
Damn!
[Crash]
U slam into the wall and u fall
Out the car, trying to crawl with one arm
About to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow, wonder if they would even call when the music stops
[Kuniva:]
Let's see how many of your men loyal,
When i pull up looking for you,
With a pistol sipping on a can of pennzoil
I'm revved up, who said what would lead bust ur head would just explode
With red stuff i'm hand cuffed tossed in the paddy wagon
Braggin about how u shot it like a coward, bullets devour you showered you
Niggars, if i was u niggas, i'll run while given the chance
Understand i can enchance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me, just the thought of dying alone that really
Hurts me, u ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop trying to walk how g's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we plan to the war with ur life, fuck the tour and the mic
I'll rather fuck a whore with a knife, deliver that shit the coroner's like
You high hype poppin' shit in broad day light nigga ur a gonna at night
When The Music Stops
[Proof:]
Instigators,  pits in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbours
wrist to razors
Ya'll don't want war, you want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like woof
Proof nigga I'm a wolf, get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomped the roof shake the floor tiles loose
The more ya'll breach, the more I moves
This hell street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap checking all our jewels (nigga)
Or make the news betcha all ya'll move
When the uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
[Bizzare:]
Music's changed my life in so many ways
Brains confused and fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
NWA said fuck the police
Now i'm in jail
93 was strictly RNB
Fucked up hair cut
Listen to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who go tell me i'm Mike
Ass cheeks painted white
Fucking Presilla at night
Flying down sunset smoking crack
Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
MOP had me grindy and griddy
Marilyn Manson, i dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bowls
Now i'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, i'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops

Transvestite in the front
Eddi Murphy in the back
MOP had me grindy and griddy
Marilyn Manson, i dyed my hair blue
And grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bowls
Now i'm in the hospital
Broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, i'm going in shock,
I'm reaching for the glock but the music stops
[Bang]

""no...you hear me! you go to hell"" -> mr. garrison
[eminem]
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Moms wouldn't take it, the bitch still hates me
One day she said, ""go rake leaves,"" I said, ""make me!""
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, ""please fix me!""
Back then, when will smith was still the fresh prince
And him and jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta the fake school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
Break shit!
(scratched) (4x):
""no...you hear me! you go to hell!""
[parl yams]
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in an air lock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than james evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like kool keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a fruitful hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper life bushwick bill fucker leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin?
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin?
And moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin?
So boy just slow your deck, I've been stealin?
I wet rappers cause it's me and em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like (? ? ? ) and bustin? your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggaz what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the dutch
(scratched) (4x):
""no...you hear me! you go to hell!""
[eminem]
I ended my last show with a horse swingin? a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two zantacs I give a fuck if I sound whack
Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm happy gilmore, you slip me anything in pill form
I'm in to mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 thursday; six more birthdays
And I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats i'ma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So ""i'm the rapper, he's the dj""
I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin ""f/u/c/k""
So jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: ""no!"")
Y'all can kiss my ass until your lips stick to my pants

Everything that matters..yes..in this room
When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak just be
Loves a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day or one more minute
Without you in it
Life is sooo sweet
When you lie next to me
My heart is yours
Every part of me still wants to give you more
More time...to love
Cause you never know where life will lead us
I wanna take in all the beauty here...oh

country of our's, the stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect,
the women and men who have broke their neck's for the freedom of speech the United States
government has sworn to uphold, or so we're told...
Yo', I want everybody to listen to the words of this song, I never would've dreamed in a
million years i'd see, so many motherfuckin' people who feel like me, who share the same views
and the same exact beliefs, it's like a fuckin' army marchin' in back of me, so many lives I
touch, so much anger aimed, in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays, and straight
through your radio waves it plays and plays, 'till it stays stuck in your head for days and
days, who would of thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair, with some peroxide,
reachin for a t-shirt to wear, that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this, how
could I predict my words would have an impact like this, I must've struck a chord, with somebody
up in the office, cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nuthin' but problems, and now
they're sayin' i'm in trouble with the government, i'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life,
and now I'm dumping it on...

White America, I could be one of your kids, white America, little Eric looks just like this,
white America, Erica loves my shit, I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get, white America, I
could be one of your kids, white America, little Eric looks just like this, white America, Erica
loves my shit, I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get...
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself, if they were brown, Shady lose, Shady
sits on the shelf, but Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimple's would help, make ladies swoon
baby, {ooh baby}, look at my sales, let's do the math, if I was black, I would've sold half, I
ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that, but I could rap, so fuck school,
i'm too cool to go back, gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at, when I was
underground, no one gave a fuck I was white, no labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was
like, fuck it, until I met Dre, the only one to look past, gave me a chance, and I lit a fire up
under his ass, helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got, was probably his in
exchange for every white fan that he's got, like damn, we just swapped, sittin' back lookin' at
shit, wow, i'm like my skin is it starting to work to my benefit now, it's...
[CHORUS]
See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids, who otherwise would of never knew these words
exist, whose mom's probably would of never gave two squirts of piss, 'till I created so much
motherfuckin' turbulence, straight out the tube, right into your living room I came, and kids
flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre, that's all it took, and they were instantly hooked
right in, and they connected with me too because I looked like them, that's why they put my
lyric's up under this microscope, searchin' with a fine tooth comb, its like this rope, waitin'
to choke, tightening around my throat, watching me while I write this, like I don't like this,
nope, all I hear is, lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working 'round the clock, to
try to stop my concerts early, surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston,
after it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom, so now i'm catchin' the flack
from these activists when they raggin', actin' like i'm the first rapper to smack a bitch, or
say faggot, shit, just look at me like i'm your closest pal, the posterchild, the motherfuckin'
spokesman now for...

So to the parents of America, I am the derringer aimed at little Erica, to attack her
character, the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns, sent to lead the march right up to
the steps of congress, and piss on the lawns of the White House, to burn the casket and replace
it with a parental advisory sticker, to spit liquor in the faces of in this democracy of
hypocrisy, fuck you Ms. Cheney, fuck you Tipper Gore, fuck you with the freest of speech this
divided states of embarassment will allow me to have, fuck you, [vocal melody],

Whose arm is this?
I must have cut it off at the pharmacist
Who refused to ret roll my servitude scripts in the derby sets
(sorry)(correction: who refused to renew my seventh prescription of Darvisetts)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
That never leaves his house, cos he thinks his car's possessed.
I hate my life
That's why I degrade my wife
Grab the paper plate to make a sandwich in the state of night
(correction: grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich, and just ate the knife)
My mother screaming ""Please hear me, that it straight to Christ!""

Meets are in the streets and slap me just to break the ice (What up my man?)
(correction: meet u in ht estreet an slap you just to break the ice: what up ?

Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice
pistol whip u and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbing my head to some bullshit you were spitting
I was probably just trying to shake the lice (UUURRRGGGHHH)
Bums falling out of my head
(correction: bums falling outta my head)
I'm wishing I was dead
While I'm falling out of my bed
Pissing violet red.
And my raps are returning
I feel the sensation of burning.
The purple use of the germ with the painful release of my yermin (correction:
painful release of my urine)
I'm screaming in my saddle ""PLEASE QUIT FOLLOWING ME!!!!!""
(correction: i;m screaming at my shadow: ""please quit following me!"")
These pills keeps screaming, ""Please quit swallowing meeee!""
The devil keeps screaming, ""Please keep telling on me!""

I took the drugs before the cops or they found them on me

?Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks??
Refrain 1
2 trailer park girls go round the inside, round the inside, round the inside
(Repeat Refrain 1)
Refrain 2
Guess who's black, black again? Smiley's black, tell a friend. Guess who's
black, guess who's black, Guess who's black, guess who's black, Guess who's
black, guess who's black, guess who's black
Verse 1
I've created a monster, cuz nobody wants to see Shady no more
They want Smiley I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Smiley, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of seeds mixed with some hard liquor
Some binaca that'll jumpstart my heart quicker
Then a shock when I get shocked at the Hospital
By the Dr. when I'm not cooperating
When he's rocking the table while I'm masturbating (Hey!)
You waited this long so stop debating
Cuz I'm back, I'm on a fag and ejaculating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me leave, or let me be me so watch me flee
They tried to shut me down on EmTV, but it feels so empty with Smiley
So come on you prick, jump on a dick rotate, on the dick and suck some dick
And get ready cuz this shit's about to get heavy
I just got in all cop pursuits, ?FUCK YOU DEBBIE!?
Chorus x2
Now this ain't like a job for me
So everybody just let me be
Cuz we need a little penis envy
Cuz it feels so empty with Smiley
Verse 2
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoner's pelvis
?Till someone comes along a mission and yells ?dick?
A missionary, vision is scary, could start a resolution
Pollutin? the air waves a rebel
So let me just revel and tact, in the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass
And it's a disaster such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass you ask Smiley?
Well, I'm black
(Batman sound) Fix your bent antennae tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of perfection, back for the winter I'm interesting
The less thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kids ears and resting
Testing ?Attention Please? feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents and my ass cheeks are free
A nuisance, who sent, you sent Smiley?
Chorus x2
Verse 3
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's taking this shit that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick you can get your ass flipped
Worse than ?em little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby, you can get bombed by Dolby
This 36-year-old bald headed fag sold me
He don't know me, he's too old, let it go, move over, nobody listens to Techno
Now let's go, just give weed the signal, I'll be there with a whole crew full
of new imbeciles
I've been doped, suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince turn himself into
a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems, everybody only wants to disgust me
So this must mean I'm Smite Smiley
But it's just me I'm just smiling
Though I'm not the first queen of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black Music so selfishly
And use it to get myself healthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers submerge
But it matters how many fish in the sea
When it will be so empty with Smiley
Chorus x2
(Hum dei dei la la, Hum dei dei la la? la la la) x2 ?Kids?

I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters, runnin together and blurred spurts
Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts

Come back the next week and re-open your scab (YEAH!)
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud
I've calmed down now  I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still bein operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time
For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
But the rest of you arseholes can kiss my arse
For all the fucking drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do
To all the shitty people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
For everytime I reminisce   yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my arse
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb
Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match (""Here momma try em on"")
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,
a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives
(Shittin on rappers) Causin hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
For everytime I reminisce   yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spend a million a track and went over my budget (Oh shit)
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a click   I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me
From the second I was born, my momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage?
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake
For all the weed that I've smoked   yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
To all the friends I used to have   yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done   yo I'm still gon' do
To all the people I've offended   yeah fuck you too!
For everytime I reminisce   yo I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can kiss my ass

What we have to do is deal with it when these idividuals are young enough. If you wish to be
saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or
which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. We all have this idea that we should
move up from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better.
[Verse 1- Eminem]
Come on, let's cut the bullshit enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to bassmint
And we can disscuss statements thats made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music that we all enjoy the music you all accuse me of tryna destroy
Let's rewind it to 89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossin 8 Mile in the border in the hate territory
I'd like to share a story, this is my story and cant no body tell it for me
You will well inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear, I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
>From Bel-Air shopping center just for stopping in there
>From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side a day that I might slide
You may call it a past I call it haulin my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious oh well known tracks
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 2- Eminem]
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitch hike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 mile and van dike
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the half way mark
To meet Kim had to walk back to her mama's them dramas after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
Thats about the time I first met Proof when poof he'd carry on the set
Set eyes born in and out some flyers, he was doin some talent shows
At center line, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
I spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit that Big Daddy Kane shit with compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 3- Eminem]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool till your man MC Sham came through
And said that Boom was the brain cuz the clan makes troops
It was rumors but man god damned they flew
Musta been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones the Cool J, Ice land swayed too
And we just through them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next, X clam debut
Professor X and glorious exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key sissies now with this bein a new trend
We don't fit in crackas is out with Cactus albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represents black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showin 'em off not knowin at all
We was bein laughed at you ain't even half black
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that
And that Flavor Flave clock we gon' have to snatch that
All I remember is meetin back at Manix's basement
Sayin how we hate this, our races wit dope the x clan take this
Which reminds me back in 89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was tryna two time me and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool cuz I rapped so she was kinda eyein me
And oh the irony guess what her name was ain't even gon' say it plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school if I could pull it
Not only would I become more popular but I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And thats the last I ever seen or heard or spoke to the oh foolish pride girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong cuz no matter what color a girl is she still a (bitch?)
[Chorus x2]
Come on lets go back
Follow the yellow brick road as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home

Welcome back, to the stage of history
[Eminem]
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you,
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
to fill it full of explosive gasses
and close it back with a lit match in it
while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
Chorus: J-Black (repeat 2X)
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'ma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'ma be so high
that I'ma get up and walk, leavin the concrete bare
with the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearin a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist, God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
Chorus 1/2
[Announcer]
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
[Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like usin the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fuckin with some niggaz like this who just don't care
Chorus
[J-Black]
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
Haha..

You lose!

Krush Groovin', Body Movin' (Body Movin') [8x]
[Fat Boys]
Now we came a long way, and now we're here
The hot house rockers, crushers of fear
Three bad rockers, who gain recognition
And we are the ones, that are in position
To hang with the best, and if you don't believe
Check out the rhyme that we conceive
Let it be known, that there is no other
That can rock the house, like these three brothers
Prince Markie Dee, with Kool Rock-ski
And the Human Beat Box completes the three
We testify, and we'll last forever
Pumping and Jumping, to stand together
Taking and Breaking, Laying and Slaying
All you sucker mcs best start praying
Cause Run-DMC, Kurt, Sheila and us
We keep moving and grooving like the number 10 bus
Krush Groovin', Body Movin' (Body Movin') [4x]
[Run-DMC]
Krush Groove ya, Body Move ya
We gotta prove that this groove that we use ah
This is something that we don't rehearse
DMC is second, and I rhyme first
Now this is how we run it down the line
DMC is second, I'm first to rhyme
So why don't you call me uno, and D's for dos
Because I rock parties from coast to coast
I'm known to the world as chilly most
MC of the party and I'm the host
And I'm the one and only, the only one
And he goes by the name of DJ Run
You see they call me Run, but I never ran
In a B-Boy stance is how I stand
And Darryl Mac has cold got my back
This is funky fresh stuff, it's not an act
I'll pass it to D, I'll pass it back
That's the way it is, cause it's like that
Krush Groovin', Body Movin' (Body Movin') [4x]
[Sheila E]
I'm Sheila E and I want to say
that I'm a super high powered, cold-krushin' lady
and I'm here to talk about this thing called rap
to all the party people at the party that's packed
and you know that I'm precious, could never be lesser
Sheila E rocks the best under pressure
To all of you hip-hop be-bop fans
get out of your seats and just clap you hands
get down, don't clown to the funky sound
cause the beat is dropping all over the town
Kurtis Blow, you could never be weak
get on the mic and let me hear you speak
[Kurtis Blow]
Yes, yes y'all, ah yes, yes y'all
I'm Kurtis Blow and I'm the king and I'm the best y'all
And I'll tell you why, cause I'm fresh y'all
From the north, the south, east and west y'all
Now, I've rocked house parties in the B-Boy stance
and never, ever gave a sucker mc a chance
'cause I'm a rhyme creator, crime motivator
I'm chillin' on you now, but I can serve you later
Check out my crew that can never be beat
Ah Kurtis Blow, Sheila E and Run-DMC
and to the Fat Boys, and now you're down by law
Down with the best now let's even the score
Now just throw your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
And if you want to bust a move like the Krush Groove
Somebody say ""Oh Yeah"" (Oh Yeah)
And you don't stop, that Krush Groove rock until it hit the top
Somebody Scream!

You got my fire burning
Ay papi, Tu sabes, Yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burning
Got senoritas and Adidas over in Spain
The Don in San Juan, Got 'em going insane
Got chicks in Spanish Harlem pulling their brain
In San Paolo they follow, doing the same
Admiration for Run since sucker MCs
Papi, bilingual, selling singles with ease
Y'all think that I'm done, Run don't got no flow
What is you loco? I'm grande gato, papo
Run and Bo, DMC and Fat Joe
Four cats on the same track got dough
Us quatro got flow you don't know
From New York city to Puerto Rico
Ay papi, Tu sabes, Yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burning
Ay papi, Tu sabes, Yo tengo fiebre para ti
You got my fire burning
What's going on black? Going platinum and beyond that
Laying down the format, sipping on that
Cognac, where the Don at?
I'm in Hollis with the kings
Payin' homage to the things
They Accomplished in their teens,
And I never stop throwing the flame, controlling the game
I'm right here over the rain(bow)
And found a pot of gold
I already had a lot of flow
Ready to rock steady, we're runnin' make a lot of dough

You might tell from the way I talk
That sucker MCs is who I stalk
Creating a rhyme that is information
Or why I make such a rap creation
That is bound, to be renowned
Within this city as a funky sound
And to those that try to put me down
My DJ has jams by the pound
Ay papi, Tu sabes, Yo tengo fiebre para ti

Ay papi, Tu sabes, Yo tengo fiebre para ti

Hey yo I rolled up in the spot then I roved up
My ice bending like ""hold up""
All the chickens like: look at Bo
You be grown up, think he the bomb
With his beeper stayed blowed up
So with frost on my wrist look my fists froze up
The photographer is trying to get a little close up
Why? Cause I'm a star now?
Buy at the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?
I heard that you wanna spar now
So baby it's on, I spent flows
Ripped shows to the day that I'm gone
And this here hit, I'm gonna have America's soul
Cris Pack, Run's cloth pair, it's good to see ya go
I entered your home, let you down, should be a ball
The hit that I'm on got Spanish mamas singin' my song
Ay papi, Tu sabes, Yo tengo fiebre para ti

People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard, you want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
[Run & D.M.C. alternate lines for the remainder of the song]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is

To all you sucker MCs perpetrating a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack, keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girls ignore
I'm driving a Caddy, you're fixing a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle name is Lord
And when I'm rockin on the mic you should all applaud
Because we're wheelin, dealin, we got a funny feelin
We rock from the floor up to the ceiling
We're groovin, you're movin, it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin'
We create it, relate it, and often demonstrate it
We dis the sucker MC, make the others suckers hate it
We're rising, suprising, and often hypnotizing
We always tell the truth, and we never slip no lies in
No curls no braids peasy head and still get paid
Jam-Master cuts the records up and down the cross fade
Because the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail
Witty as can be, and not for sale
Always funky fresh could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of the word, thats what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm a master of the mic, thats what I say
And if I didn't say that, just say it anyway
Bust into the party, cover the place
See the first thing that comes, is the music in your face
Girls on the wall, some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this, because it can't be missed
And you can't leave til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave until we're through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme, Hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough till the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade that's not debated
Nothing to deep, and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there we got the notion
And we want to see y'all in motion
Just shake, wiggle, jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side, back and forth
We're the two MCs and we gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJs better than all these bands...huh
[This verse only appears in the Vocal Dub version of Rock Box]
It's the movement of your body when you're inside a party
Tryin to do a dance just like everybody
You keep the pep in your step
Inside of your heart is where its kept
It's the movement of your feet when you hear def beats
Silence so sweet, harmony is so neat
It's the movement of the head when a rhyme is said
That I rock the livin' dead, I get you out your bed
It's the movement of you arms, to a beat that's charred
We're checkin and respectin cause it's never hard
It's the movement of your jock when he rocks the block
Ill sucker def beats all around the block
It's the movement of the 'table when it starts to spin
Round and round, and back again
Huh...!
We got all the lines, and all the rhymes
We don't drive dimes, and we don't do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear those pants they're callin'Calvin Klein
Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
Don't want nobody's name on my behind
It's Lee on my leg, sneakers on my feet
D by my side, and Jay with the beat
...Jay...Run...
We don't...Jay...
Bun...Two...Tee...Run...
Hollis Crew...
But...
Cortina...
Ha...
My man Jam-Master...And his place to be...
Jay...The big beat blaster...
Waited...
Straight off the ground...All the way live...
Remember, you don't stop...beat...
Run rocks it well...With the clientelle...
Krush Groove...
Young ladies in place...with base...with the high space...
So let 'em...
Homeboy...
Now we're talkin autographs...
Homegirl...
Autographs...
Fly Girl...In place...
Homeboy...
High Street...
Fun...
Sing...

[Run]
Come on stand up, still-a, a nigga that's gettin iller
If you're weak and/or you're sleepin
(then what?) you get the cap I peel up
And til-I, I kill a sucker duck dope dealer
Sold to my brother but the ghetto stands stiller
Still-a, standin, commandin and demandin
From the get-go got the ghetto get a medal cause it's standin
I'm makin a buck, they takin a buck, the tax that attacks the world
A system built to diss em (who?) the boys (who) and the girls
They starvin, we're starvin, keepin a nine to five an'
Try to hold us down, keep us out but we be risin
Risin, risin, risin like the cream
Stiggidy stiggidy stiggidy still, stiggidy standin for the team
[Chorus One: Run-D.M.C. (repeat 2x)]
We put three in the head
And the little one said roll over, roll over
""Do or die!""
[D.M.C.]
I run amuk upon the sucker duck punks that I'm steppin on
The one you're bettin on you're lucky like a leprechaun
I turn my weapon on my record ?? ??
Mic checkin and I'm wreckin and I'm checkin on
So check it check it out, I'm gonna rock the house
Without a doubta I'ma shout about to turn it out
So take a step BACK, I gotta wreck TRACK
I got a rep for breakin necks, I get respect black
(Damn damn!) Darryl Mack, you're all of that
They pray they can save the crazy rat
They attack to mack to move him off the map
Could never tell I fell, to hell and back
It's beautiful - the mic makes hits
To the dirty, stinkin, son of a.... (auuuuuuhh)
I'm mad and glad and sad and highly upset
So don't do nothin that you might regret
Cause I'll stomp that ass, like a little insect (c'mon)
Clean off my kicks (c'mon) clean off my kicks (c'mon)
Clean off my kicks and then STEP!
(stiggidy-stick, step!)
[Chorus One]
[Chorus Two: Run-D.M.C.]
So they all rolled over and one fell out
We put two in the head
And the little one said, roll over, roll over!
""Do or die!""
We put two in the head
And the little one said..
[Run]
Now c'mon step to me do me pursue me you never knew me
You'll be sleepin and you slept on the step
And now your crew be sweatin me like you're sweatin the sweat
Another groupie dissin D, now you're back on the set
I'm makin em takin em breakin em all
Diss em one by one
You make the mistake of thinkin I'm soft
Thinkin Run ain't the one
From eighty-three and they be seein me and D and they front
?? the suckers from the ruckus that's about to become
Reel it back, come REWIND it's about that time
Feelin wack, ate the swine it's about that swine
In your body couldn't keep up at the end of the set
Bet ya beat ya that I teach ya and you're stuck until death
(That's what I'm sayin)
[Chorus One]
[Chorus Three: Run-D.M.C.]
We put two in the head
And the little one said

And the little one said, roll over, roll over!

But the offer that I make, it won't be made again
You don't have to write, you don't have to call
It's a one-time offer for nothing at all
And there's no red tape, I don't make it hard
You don't need cash money or a Master Card
I got easy terms, and a layaway
But I need a quick decision, and I need it today
And if you find that you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days
Now have you ever seen a man with a guarantee?
Well you're lookin at him now, cause the man is me
And if you don't believe all the things I say
I'm certified 'prime' by the USDA
Now the name that I use DJ Run
And I'm a fast-talkin slow-walkin number one
And if you don't believe all the words I say
Then you're a natural born fool who's got to be that way
I got a 50 rating and a 50 share
Every minute, every hour that I'm on the air
And when I come to town, I'm on a big marquee
It says (DJ Run) and me, D.M.C.
And if you find that you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days
A good job and lots of money might not be enough
And to satisfy your needs it may be rough
But I take some care and treat you nice
And if it ain't sufficient once, I cold work it out twice
And if you find that you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days
I'm gonna give you everything that you ever need
If you need a pint of blood, then I'll even bleed
If you're lookin for a car, I will buy you two
And if you're lookin for a pet, I'll buy a kangaroo
If you need a vacation, we can fly the world
And you'll know I'll never look at another girl
I'm a single-minded man, and my mind is set
You're the lady of the '80s that I'm gonna get
And if you find you don't like my ways
Well, you can send me back in 30 days

[From ""The Corruptor"" Soundtrack]
Yo yo brand new KRS y'all, Maximum Strength
5 Boroughs of death we rep to death
Yo Kris, set it for The Bronx..
[KRS-One]
We hit em and get em, we stick em and jig em
we pick em and kick em
Flippin them whip and I'm wing-clippin them lip
cause I'm cold sick of them
Much quicker than them lyrically trickin and my Tribe
be on a Quest like Tip and them
On every avenue puttin the full clip in em
Splittin and strippin em down while spittin a round
into them soundclash see winnin them, just begginin them
Get rid of ev-ery bit of them with them negative idioms
I don't even consider them
In the new millenium we killin them
Breeze Deep, Kenny and Will and them, KRS-One we thrillin em
Many battles we been in them now we rebuildin them
We blaze, fulfillin them, Keith ?, Jesse, Jamil and them
We originate styles, other be stealin them
[Vigilante]
You got a good rise in your rolodex, who flow is next?
Comin out to {'uck} with the best, put it in your chest
Inhale it and hold that, blow it out when I say let go; let's see
if you can hold your breath, by the time I flip to the next flow
This sho' is real, this is the deal, guns I'm runnin
Gotta make it out of town to flip my {tish} and keep it comin
Then bring it back, with another stack, of raps to blow your back out
How many of y'all wanna go for yours I keep my dogs in the crackhouse
[Buckshot]
Let's take a walk through Crown Heights
Steppin through the city at night, with the ? and two mic
Form a little lynch mob, and stomp through the five boroughs
Head back to Brooklyn in the Expo
Back on the block, I see the cops everybody clockin
Buckshot, when you see the rocks, me I got you shocked
Why not? You see the recipe
Buckshot, I represent Brooklyn and my {nigga} Biggie
[Keith Murray]
I'm from C-I, L-I, F-L-Y
Where the {niggaz} and the {bitches} stay paid fly and high
Where a slut'll get mad if you call her a {bitch}
And a rat'll get mad if you call her a snitch
Where the rich emerge, with the {niggaz} from the ditch
And it's a myth, they get {niggaz} from the suburbs, that's herbs
Yo this is for my {niggaz} on the block all day
Who don't give a {'uck} waitin for crime to pay
Put your money on it, yo we never fronted
Long Island got some of the best {niggaz} that ever done it
From Riverhead to C.I. to Brentwood to Wyndanch
{Niggaz} comin through will not stand a chance
From Roosevelt to Freeport to Hempstead to Uniondale
Comin deep from the depths of hell
I'm dead serious, even though you see me smilin
Rough enough to break New York from Long Island
[Cam'Ron]
We destroy {niggaz}, need advice, cause I heard em sayin Jesus Christ
You should see the sight, cookin ox-tail, peas and rice
Makin about a G a night, they can't read or write
But I got every creed and type, you need a dyke, babygirl I see the light
But sometime y'all get crimey crimey, grimy grimy
But those with a tiny hiney they get whiny whiny
So guard your girl, Harlem World, cock the gun, pop it son
Fila fam, illa players, Killa Cam is still the man
[?]
Uptown massive, Uptown the borough
Uptown let the ? kali, no sorrow
Uptown trestle, Uptown of course
I grab you ? they got me turn up to North
And if dem turn up North ? hurt no tell de boss
And if dem tell me off dey are a bunch of ghosts
And if dem gal are up, well den dem know da gal are boss
De rap dancehall try on de Mossinos
And if dem tie me off, dem can call me Cedro
I put a rap to singalong in all de ? crew
And if da gal a bitch ? ? the rainbow
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
[Killah Priest]
Yo, hit you with the force of an iron horse
Tear your face off the planet, leavin one-third damaged
Witcha back cracked the earth canvas, leavin mountains slanted
Rock the earth of the axle, crabs who
Polar bears beneath the sea gravel
Thoughts be runnin wild like the Lil' Rascals
Puttin dinosaurs inside of figure fours, rip you with nine inch claws
Chasin {mother'uckers} through malls, and clash in halls
Beatin {mother'uckers} through walls, stompin through floors
and jumpin down elevator shafts
Searchin for they {ass}, stayin low in the grass
Wearin a gas mask, wrappin their hands up in plastic bags
On stage like a savage goin mad
WHAT? Yeah yeah, sooooooooooooo!
[Prodigy]
Yeah, by all means you know you gotta put Queens on it
Put cream on it, Q.B. we rep often
Take over your party, slamdance witcha hood
Took your ladies back to the projects with us
Then sent her {ass} back on the Q-train home
Satisfied, she learned the words to my thug song
See we one big borough of Dons with firearms
And we never use those, til the man act
other than he's 'sposed to, {nigga} what I'm 'sposed to do?
Shots whistle, damn near missed dat
Shoes get pissed at
[Redman]
From the, tip of my Timbs, to my eyebrows
The hostile, english, Olde E widemouth
Get PCP fiends, jumpin off cliffs
And if you had the balls, you'd be walkin off stiff
My paragraph alone is worth five mics (uh-huh)
A twelve song LP, that's thirty-six mics (uh-huh)
And while you win Un Hype (uh-huh) I spit on your snipe
and tell you {'uck you} and that {bitch} on your bike
Brick City!!
[Reverand Run]
Aiyyo.. now bust it
Never try me crimey I'm grimy so don't deny me
I be Little like your Rascals and stymie to fly that hiney
Buy me keys, to my Benz and my Coupe
Like Jay and Run and D.M.C.'s, that's the name of my group
(now speed it up)
Beat to the rhythm of the rhyme
I'm givin up a dime, there go another line you figured
Never drivin by nine, never givin up a dime if you was
Never been that {nigga}
If you really wanna test me, brother don't stress me
Or you just be bowlin
It's Reverand like a Jesse, brother that's just me
and that's just my calling
The five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little {niggaz}, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot
Let's rock'n'roll, you know the M.O., it gets real
when the five boroughs of death, we rep to death
Step aside little {niggaz}, show time yep
It's goin down the moment we inside the spot

There are 8 million stories in the naked city
8 million stories [4x]
[Verse one Kurtis Blow]
There are 8 million stories in the naked city
Some ice cold and told without pity
About the mean streets and the guetto culture
The pimps,the pushers,the sharks and vultures
Things that happen when it reaches dark
And all the things you hear about Central Park
You got to be down,you got to have strenght
If you're gonna survive past 110th
Well it ain't no thing when blood is spilled
The emergency ward is capacity filled
And nothin' ever comes as a big surprise
And the naked city never closes its eyes
A new story every day
Told a thousand different ways
That's how it is and that's how it goes
The city with the 8 and six big O's
New York is a crazy city man.....
Yo, my home boys Run DMC
[Verse two Run DMC]
A young girl seemed to be gaining weight
Her parents all thought it was the food she ate
Their attitudes were all la-de-da-de
But little did they know there's a baby in the body
She tried to hide it,but they'll soon know
Because sooner or later that baby's got to show
Can her daddy just accept it as a fact
That it wasn't the meals and it wasn't the snack
Then there's another girl,her name is Vicki
The girl is fine,but sho'nuff tricky
Vicki's fine,,but then she's not very kind
She'll lay you down and then she'll rob you blind
You wake up in the morning and you're feelin' blue
Because Vicki is gone and your money is too
She's more sinister than Peter Lorre
And this is just two of 8 million stories
8 million stories [12x]
[Verse three Kurtis Blow]
Fresh kid and the stories complete
Born on a dim lit ghetto street
Father unknown,mother astray
He learned about life the real hard way
Wearin' pretty things for all the ladies to see
Funky fresh diamonds and gold jewelry
Spent all his time just counting his bank
Because he's a fly muh-ha-ha,now fill in the blank
Because he's a fresh kid and his money's long
Been the subject of a ghetto song
Poor kids admire,ladies desire
They say water can't put out this fire
Because he's a fresh kid,yeah he's alright
Grew up with the pushers and the pimps of the night
And you could measure or even treasure
The thought that cocaine became his pleasure
Puruvian rock never cut with speed
And he gets skied untill his nose would bleed
And that was just one weakness,must admit
That when he took a hit he could never quit
Because he's one slick pusher livin' day by day
When the crazy thing happened along the way
You know he started to base at a hell a pace
And now it's a disgrace,he's got the pipe in his face
For twenty-four seven a terrible Jones
Didn't take care of business,didn't answer the phone
He stayed home alone all in the twilight zone
Just bittin' on a pipe like a dog on a bone
Turnin' blue in the face,by holdin' his breath
With the white cloud bullshit stuck in his chest
But then he tried to stop,but it never worked
And then the ladies started calling him a freebase jerk
Just to break it all down,you know he's not very slick
Because he spent all his money and he spent it real quick
He lost his car,his house,his friends and his wife
And basing cocaine made him lose his wife
Because he bought some on credit and couldn't pay
And then the pusher looked for him and blew him away
In a blaze of glory in his own territory
8 million stories sad but all real stories
8 million stories [12x]

Yo, yo
Ayo I've seen Run with the chrome spinning
Watching the Knicks in the back of the 6
Pulled up on the side like who's winning?
Nigga said me since '83 get it right
Politely flashed his Rollie then dipped through the light
Next night seen him on stage with some platinum shells
With baguettes on the side that spelt 'raising hell'
I said Run the crowd yells, like you paid 'em well
Then he said to ask Burt Bodell...Who the hell?
Oh well I thought I was done being impressed
Until my man called me up and told me listen to flex
I ain't know what to do, looks like Run was sending everybody
But then again the chit was true
MCs must want him gone, hopping on thrones
Saying they the kings, please, who kept the seat warm?
Ain't nobody better than this twenty year veteran
Even as a reverend, hotter than you ever been
It don't really matter who the hell you are
From the fakest of pole cats to the biggest of stars
Trying to doubt these three, you breaking the law
They're the kings leaving y'all in awe, it's real par like:
Ahhh, Run done did it again
Ahhh, pad done hit the pen
Ahhh, man they dropping jams
Ahhh, kids 'bout stack in the end
Yo, Rev Run, run the block
Swerve the doc, flow is hot, don't need no gun to cock
I'm sick of it all, you brothers try to get me to fall
I'm kicking it raw, even in the thick of it all
Run laps around wack cats I hate DATs
Since way back, made great tracks, I lace raps, you'll face that
Before you catch aluminium bats from numerous cats
With Run-DMC on they hats
You ain't getting no show till your album out
The label don't want to spend money, yo what's that about?
No clout had to settle for a fake amount,
Well, my catalogue's bigger than your bank account
No doubt I'm the greatest all time for sure
Rev Run coming through and leaving niggas in awe
Like...
Ahhh, Run done did it again
Ahhh, pad done hit the pen
Ahhh, man they dropping jams
Ahhh, kids 'bout stackin' the ends
Ahhh, Run done did it again
Ahhh, pad done hit the pen
Ahhh, man they dropping jams
Ahhh, kids 'bout stackin' the ends
Yo Run, remember that night at the light in the back of the 6?
Yeah I was mad the Knicks lost I got a new whip
Yeah I see the Bentley Arnage with the four doors
What is that for more whores?
Naw, son, for more tours
I see you been peepin' me for quite some time (yo my bad)
Ain't a thing, Nigga I noticed your rhymes
Yo, what a nigga gotta do to be more like you?
A nigga like me ain't got a clue...
First things first, I DJ Run, all the rappers, actors they want status
But they can't have this, since Krush Groove you been making them papes
A lot of rap movies been made since, but most of them fake
Thanks for the compliment kid, now jump back in your car
It's the reverend, leaving niggas in awe, it's real par like
Ahhh, Run done did it again
Ahhh, pad done hit the pen
Ahhh, man they dropping jams
Ahhh, kids 'bout stack in the end

In San Paolo they follow, doing the same
Admiration for Run since sucker MCs
Papi, bilingual, selling singles with ease
Y'all think that I'm done, Run don't got no flow

That sucker MCs is who I stalk

You be grown up, think he the bomb
With his beeper stayed blowed up
So with frost on my wrist look my fists froze up
The photographer is trying to get a little close up
Why? Cause I'm a star now?
Buy at the bar now?
Or I press one button, start up my car now?
I heard that you wanna spar now
So baby it's on, I spent flows
Ripped shows to the day that I'm gone
And this here hit, I'm gonna have America's soul

Once again
From the dephts of hell
Run-D.M.C.

And y'all take this
[ *Jam-Master Jay cuts up* ]
(From the dephts of hell)

Comin from the one..) (where they at?) (..comin back from hell)
[ VERSE 1: Run ]
I'm comin back from hell, a jail cell tells no tales
The walls, the floors, the blinds, it never fails
To catch a little butt from a inmate's head
So sorry for you sucker, see ya, sissy, you're dead
Another rolled-over casket, tisket, a tasket
This ain't no thanks to the pussy-ass bastard
Easy for another man to laugh at his face
Like I said, his head to bed, another dead inmate
Raw to the bone and killed him for the phone
Mommy's only son, but left his mama alone
The last words he heard ""Your time is up"", the result
Caught back around, his naked face cut to a pulp
Never knew he'd go to jail doin murder and he fell
(Reporting live from Rikers Island) and comin back from hell
(From the dephts of hell)

Back from hell
But I still smell the same old shit
From the lower level
Ice Cube'll beat the shit out the devil
Nothin changed, still down with the P.E., son
But now I'm raising hell with Run
Nearly gettin done from the sawed off shotgun
Pressin they luck, didn't duck, I hauled off and socked one
Don't laugh, hoes, cause I'm down with The Afros
Ice Cube ain't The Mack, but I have hoes
JMJ drop the hammer
And I kick grammar
That's mackaframalama
Had to ask D.M.C. and the 40oz. Crew
What's it all about on the avenue
He said, ""Come see,"" gave me a swig of Olde E
Then I had to pee upon a tree
A nigga got shot by a dopefiend
Snort down my dick and unbottoned on my jeans
Then the fuckin Lench Mob had to get mean
Did a drive-by in the middle of Queens
Hot shells hit the ground
People stood around, all the niggas that I clowned
Jumped on a plane cause it never fails
Ice Cube is a muthafucka goin back to hell
(Back) (back) (from the dephts of hell)
(Back) (back) (from the dephts of hell)

Back up - they can never keep a good man down
Of course we don't fuck around
You don't know what I mean?
Don't mistake us for the Tragically Hip
Cause we're born with the trigger lip
Here's a story about the devil
And the rebel in the middle of a battle
With a crew that grew around the avenue
This devil was a federal judge who delivered us justice
Just us, up the river, but
I'm not alone and no one is, his name up against
Cause he's been runnin the hoes and the drug thing
I know he fought and runnin court, pusher of the button
Talkin mo' shit, but sayin nothin now
Cause he's seein the faces he saw sit-packin
Hardcore and all black and
Raw, and you can tell
No matter how loud he yell, he ain't leavin hell

Back from hell, now a nigga like D starts yellin
No sellin out, no tellin who's sellin
Word to the 90s, rebels still rebellin
Cube, Run and Chuck (yo, what the fuck are they yellin?)
Lyrics that I kick might just get me into pee and shit
That I'm not with and critics can get the diddick
Hits comin crazy, trips for the gravy
Played me, paid me, little lady laid me
Doooowwnnn to the dephts of heeeellllll
Now here we go, and once again
We're back from hell, so tell a friend
For all of you who thought we're through
I'm a full-fledged member of the Hollis Crew
I bust a nine or a rhyme or two
You know I grew, up on (the avenue)
I'ma sip on some brew with my crew
We was gettin illy
Niggas came through actin silly
One punk starts to yell
2 shots, then his man fell
He didn't know that Hollis Ave. was hell
Don't tell me you ain't with this
You think I fell? Chump, that is ridiculous
You missin lyrics of the microphone king I grip
Figure this, but yo, this is nigga shit
Black I.P.'s, MC's wanna-be's
Macaroni and cheese, only phoney MC's
Play the role and always try to cook up
I got tunes, room that I took up
Oh well, you know I still dwell
Go and tell everybody that I'm back from hell
(Dephts of hell)
(Back) (from the dephts of hell)
(Back)
(Back) (back)
Drop it on em, D
(Back)
(Back) (back)
(Back)
(Back) (back)

Incredible, Jam Master
Yo, back up off the ropes, punk
Beats to the rhyme, of the rhyme I just made
Party at the jam and tonight the lights fade
Scooting for the loot until we all get paid
So let's go (that was good, huh?)
Yo! D that's me, the King, the MC
Rhyme get mine on the t-o-p
Can another MC ever f*ck with me? (Hell no)
It's like the A the B to the C
It's easy as (1, 2, 3)
(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)
So hit it Run (that was good, huh?)
It's time for we to cease (So what?)
So rhymers speak your piece
Why? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)
Cause he's number (1, 2, 3, 4, hit it)
Dance to the rhythm, the rhyme I cold flow
Chance that we give em is what I told Joe
For these routines like 1983
It's just a little reminder
So those suckas is kinder
A little message from (Run-D.M.C.)
Cuts for days will amaze and faze
But will make you sad to tan all the dance aways
Got the mic, the man, the master plan
About to ram the jam
(Know I am?) Goddamn!
Spins he wins, clocking endless ends
To his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today, this is what I say
(d*ck in your mouth all day)
(that was good, huh?)
My beats were played and made rhymes laid
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)
Yes my brother I'm a do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And I'm on the throne but I'm not alone
Got chrome of steel and not of stone
I'm known to be prone and make your momma move
Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run at the front but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King
Hardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more
And like I said before...
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam
D that's me and that's who I am
Rocking on the mic cause you know I can
You gotta understand I don't give a damn
Jay here a play today I must say
Hooray to the way that is A-OK
As we wax the tracks all the DJ's play
With (gimmie your mouth)
A little (gimmie your mouth)
A big (gimmie your mouth all day)

[DMC] And this is, the hardcore raw
Lyrical law, never seen before
And I am, D.M.C..
And for all of y'all
This is the way, we reckless for rhymes
[Run]
You got to save it for David and wave it if you think that I gave it
I never gave a damn about a critic so save it
I run amuk demanding my opinion you make it
The critic'll get the didick and if you got it then stay with it
You never knew me but you flew me to your town see
By kickin dollars straight to Hollis I'm off the ground B
I never heard of such where niggaz stand and I fell
I'm doin years with this career like Patti La-Belle
And if I ever was to fall I fell upon ya
Like ?? I made my mind I come to con ya
I see females I tell them yo my word is bond huh
Like Terri Teresa Tammi Tawana Tarena and Tonya
I'm comin hard I got your head and yeah the lock's on
I threw you up, why did your daddy ?? cock strong
I rock I wreck I rip a rhyme I ??
My rap is right I write a rip-and-ready rock song
[D.M.C.]
Call on the brother to come and get dumb
Until the def drum come as they come, when they come
I said I rip some, tearin them up, a big up
A whattup? A nigga, a so what, yeah put your bricks up
I knock down the walls because I got to
The rock sound because I hip-hop new
Not the old, gold, from around the neck
And when I grab ahold you give me nuff respect
In a black BM, with my contact lens
When the track begins, I'm setting new rap trends
Lettin lyrics I lay down
You play loud I stay proud with Jay down you stay down
Get up on the truck song, the one you put your buck on
You're stuck on, you're luck on, you're sucked on
A lollipop SUCKA
I snuck ya, I struck ya, you stupid mother..
[Run]
I gotta come my name is Run and me and D we been appointed
I'm ever so clever you never TOUCH the annointed
I'm Born Again I got a friend the Lord I rearrange
But other than that I'm livin fat and ain't NUTHIN changed
Big Willie still in your grilly, you better block son
I bust you up and then I blast you with my Bop Gun
A million times rhyme risin to the prime
While another nigga's cuts get bucks, like it's a dope rhyme
Be instead I'd rather leave another brother dead
Cause yet another brother deaded from the slow dread
I'm makin papers, brothers catchin vapors
Try to lick shot, you get got, catch you later
This ain't The Cosby Show you know what it's like A Different World
We're livin inside a world where you get the cash, you hit the girl
So check the hypness, I'm not livin like this
I'm the type of guy to bust your eye, you lose your whiteness
You comin butt when you wish upon a star
But I could never be butt, so yo, bust the guitar!
[Guitar and scratches]
[D.M.C.]
Heads up my brother, here comes another
Word to the verb the urge to discover
A lover, you hover, you smother, my brother
You can't do nothin other than take the record out the cover
You get the song at it's strong and randomn flow
You sing along cause the words you heard you know
Hostyle the style that style is wild
The penile is where I goes and smile
Because I pop a lot, they try to lock me up
Because I rock the block, they try to stop me up
But I'm sly as a fox I can rocks
I got smarts when they starts tradin shots they get dropped
I pull my card I pull my card I pull my card NOT
I use the rock to be hard, I'm a hard rock
You get a speedknot, and then you bleed a lot
You better read a lot because you really need a lot of
Information, and some education
Cause I'm replacin what you hearin on your station
Darryl is a Mack, Joe is in the Public
Jason leads the nation and I know you're gonna love it, Jay!!

Can I get a witness? (Yes you can!)

By the R-U-N-D-M-C (that's where it's at cuz)
Known as the tough cats, kickin tough rough raps
In jeans, leather jackets, my Adidas and gangster hats
A ?? ?? ??, yo here we go
I'm tired of brothers tryin to front like they don't hear me though
Knowin if it wasn't for me, they wouldn't be able
Cause I'm the man with the hand that rocked the cradle, uhh
A lot of punk for the chunk baby that's a bet
Album number seven and we still ain't finished yet
I didn't get old, I got better at the craft
Sat back and watched you try to kick it but you made us laugh
So get back, you already had your chance to dance
You proved you had no waist to fit in this man's pants
Word to God, I'm back fo' sho'
Hollis Queens gettin wreck so act like you know
[Chorus]

As I spit this and get this out of my throat
I need a witness to get with this - take notes
Great quotes like boats float flowin so dope
Never givin up hope, nope, know what I wrote
I'ma saver spectator educator entertainer
You wanna ask me, can't be now or later
I'm a rough rugged person, been that way from the start
Darryl Mack got the knack to put the H in heart
(And it ain't no fun, to step to D and Run
But if you wanna step up, step up and get that ass - done)
A reporter with recorder was recordin the slaughter
As I'm peepin 'cross the border leapin water keepin order
Lit it up like a spliff, get a whiff of this hit
Cause I flick em like bits, and I bust 'em like zits
Dippin down to grip this microphone I rip this
I'm glad not sad I flipped this, now can I get a witness

Can I get a witness, can I hit a, never been ?? fitness
Don't play like I'm bitter, when you come with your best
And I make a suggestion save it David with your bull
Cause you're full of congestion
Soft? Never me, never get more hard
The King of Kings, Lord of Lords, is the one Lord God
Can I can I get a witness ?? ?? next
To my God, DJ Run and I kick it

Suckers suckers suckers
Suckers get flipped when I start to flip
Slip in a clip when they die I dip
Still spray a gun, see how DJ Run
Leave a sucker stunned, gettin ill to the drum
Mic check and I wreck and I'm second to none
Accept it don't regret it I expect to get dumb

I be signing autographs, for three months straight
I got jet-set women, who offer me favors
My face is a thousand lipstick flavors
Need a sip of lemonade, I'm a slave to my trade
From all these lights my complexion might fade
Secretary overworked, by a money hungry jerk
Got a letter and some woman wants to freak out on my shirt
Well can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that
Can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that
Huh!! [echoes]
Your ears are clogged, your head as hard as a log
My privacy robbed, let me do my job
You funny lookin slob eatin shish-kabob
You're the reason why my eyes are on the doorknob
Can you rock it like this? I think I rock it like that
But can you rock it like this? Homeboy I rock it like that
I'm straining not complaining for a casual life
Something normal nuttin formal three kids and a wife
I'm dying from the spying that you're putting me through
I perspire I'm on fire when I'm thinking of you
But can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that
Well can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that

If I think it I will say it, you might have a recorder
And then, UHH-OHH, the nation's in upheaval
Old ladies always looking at me evil
You're stepping on my heels, you're breathing down my neck
I'm not Rodney Dangerfield, so give me respect
Can you rock it like this? I-I can rock it like that

Can you rock it like this? Yo I can rock it like that
But can you rock it like this? I can rock it like that
Hu-Huh-Huh!! [echoes]
What it all adds up to, is just one thing
Run-DMC is, the king of the swing
And if you mess with us, you'll be a real short liver
You may be big but our bodyguard's bigger [echoes]

It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
When I see a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an illin' reindeer
But then I was illin' because the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man had gone
But he must have dropped his wallet smack down on the lawn
I picket the wallet up then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said ""Santa Claus""
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough's for me
[D.M.C.]
It's Christmas time in Hollis Queens
Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
In the fireplace is the yule log
Beneath the mistle toe as we drink egg nog
The rhymes that you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
But each and every year we bust Chrsitmas carols
(Christmas melodies)
[Run-D.M.C.]
Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it
It's Christmas time and we got the spirit
Jack Frost chillin, the orchids out
And that's what Christmas is all about
The time is now, the place is here
And the whole wide world is filled with cheer
[D.M.C.]
My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand
And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman
So open your eyes, lend us an ear
We want to say Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Ho-ho-hoin, what do you think, on Xmas it'll be snowin
And people get their ???, ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? for growin
You knowin, we're ???, in da Ghetto they're gettin nothin
No toys for little boys, no curls for girls, the turkey stuffin
They laugh, they have presents, ain't thick
You might just wanna ask, ""Where's my present St. Nick?""
So think, a little about people minus money
And when you get some dough, why don't you show some kind of sunny
Go 'head, get fed, and spread a little love
Get what you can afford just like the Lord from up above
A quote, a note, and when you won't believe
It's better to give than to receive (Yo!)
It's Xmas no ???, listen all you listeners
Think of all the prisoners that's in prison during Xmas
Now try and bring your ???, to try and put you up on
Layin it on the table, so you're able to put your cup on
No snow, no not a flurry, so hurry don't you miss it
Not dissin you but wishin you a very merry Xmas
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Xmas yo!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough (Here we go, here we go!)
[DMC]
I'm from the Ghetto, does this mean I get no toys or presents beneath
my tree?
I wrote my list, I made my wish, is dis what Xmas means to me?
No snowflakes droppin, can't go shoppin
Rhymes are a-poppin, to keep the hip-hoppin
Why cant-a Santa pause for the cause?
I'm gettin mine, you gettin yours, thats how Xmas is supposed ta be
A very merry Xmas for everybody, fight poverty, give to the needy
Don't be like the Grinch, cause the Grinch is greedy
Deck the malls with balls of holly, tis the season to be jolly
No presents for my tree and, I don't even know if any gifts I'm gonna
get
Happy holidays, not like a lot a days, a few here, a few there, to the
New Year
Seasons Greetings are the reasons for the cheer
If Santa Claus is coming to town, hope it's my chimney he's coming down
On Xmas, because Xmas is, on Xmas, because Xmas is
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Xmas yo!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough (Here we go, here we go!)
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Xmas yo!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough (Here we go, here we go!)
Here we go - flow!
[Reverend Run]
Have a very merry merry merry, and hairy
And if ya need a leader, Run be there for your blurry blurry sight
And write, a rhyme for the night
Xmas is a time for givin, not for the tight
So open your pocket, your heart, unlock it
Dollars straight from Hollis, I give it like I clock it
Cold is the weather, minus the humidity
Don't mistake, ??? ??? ??? ??? ???
Xmas, dis must be the time of year
Lego of your ego, rather ego amigo be there
And here, my dear, so give a kid a beer
Cause everytime you give, its coming back, lets get it clear
I'll be scopin, and hopin, brothers lend an ear
So have a merry Xmas, and a happy New Year
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Xmas yo!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough (Here we go, here we go!)
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough!
Give up the dough on Xmas yo!

I'm the epitome of royalty, you versus me, it's a joke
I'm a rage, amazing blaze, you cigarette smoke
Your video's number one and that was part of my plan
Went from Rock Box to a whole countdown jam
Took rock music, switched and flipped and made it raw
Anyway you've played it, we've played it before in '84
Every show, a hundred thousand people or more
Famous still give us tours, and we be tryin' not to take em' all
I bake em' all quicker than Sara Lee, come battle me
Imagine that, what a sight that'll be
Front page of the times, I can read the headlines now
Rev Run beat clown down, when tryin' to take his crown
The King's a ruler, the ruler rules [4x]
I'm the reason you started rhyming
I'm the reason rap sales started climbing
That's why I'm still headlining
I'm the King and before I stop, y'all cats gonna learn
Yeah, y'all niggas wanna burn, so wait your turn
Run, I'm a living legend, my suggestion is learn your lesson
I'll leave you stressing, confessing and desperate striving for a blessing
And whatever your impression..it better be,
That we the top pedigree bringing y'all energy since '83
I run this here since way back when
I picked up a pair of shells, and make y'all wear em' again
If you thought it, I done did it, heard it, I done spit it
New cats wanna pay their respect, son I'm with it
But if not, I'm a reclaim the top of the charts
Doin' shows with dough flows frip 'em apart
Other than that, I'll just be holding my own
Crown royalty up on a throne, for real

Hollowed be thy name, thy kingdome come

[Run only]
Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was def and then it went this way
Gotta story to tell about my man Big Sam
Juice unbelieveable across the land
Ill type of fella with lots of gold
Getting money, what, so the story is told
Lived in town around the way,
Up the street, 'round the corner, by the dock of the bay
Kept heads under pressure, money was livin'
Had a crib across town crowded with women
Hot for God, then it got odd
Sammy flipped his scheme for a 6 foot broad
Honey was fly, but yo conniving
Scheming on the way Sammy was riding
He had a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it read 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see him cruisin' girls move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit 'em all in the ride
it's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Sammy had girls in ill tight places
Never got gear until honey came through
This girl named Dalilah made him flip on his crew
It's with the one two three, three to two one
My man named Sam, my name's DJ Run
Honey got bold, secret told
Cut locks from his head to get the gold
Put him in jail without the bail
That's a lot to pay for a stank female
Moral to the story, don't dis God
Think with your brain, not with your rod

Not the best, not the worst, 'cause my name is Run
And I'm second, 'cause the record that you want to see
An MC (like D) is like the place to be
And have you heard that he is third, and his name is jay
I run the A to deuce, and Jay's the trey
Well the rap of the year and this is the year of the rap
And I'm never drinking beer, champagne out of a tap
And I'm cold, making money on a regular basis
Putting out, knocking out Sucker MCs faces
Travelling 'round the world with my mind at ease,
No Calvin Kleins, just wearing Lees
Got credit in places I've never been
'Cause the rhymes I write are in the top 10
The top of the charts is where I stay,
But I also chill around the way
In Hollis, Queens, is where I stalk
On the street with the beats is where I walk
When I perform, many hearts are warm
I'm better known, as the quiet storm
I don't talk too much, but I got beef
When I kill MCs I cause grief
Devastating Mic Control is my main goal
My name is Darryl, and his name is Joe
The master of music, his name is Jay
Leave us alone, and let us play
We give it up, and turn it loose
We're not like Dr. Seuss or Mother Goose
Sucker MCs like punks who are picking flowers
Go for yours, we went for ours
Start at three, end at six
Jam-Master Jay is on the mix
For all the young ladies, and all the chicks
We got all of the girls on our tips
Don't buy gold lighters, only Bics
Rock all microphones just for kicks
Sucker MCs I will be snuffin
And my pocket I'll keep on stuffin
When I say I'll beat 'em up, I won't be bluffin
They can't beef, 'cause that ain't nuthin
But it don't matter, my pocket gets fatter
I've got more hats than the Mad Hatter
I'm rapping with the mic, drive a caddie, not a bike
Drive the rhymes in your face, and end your life
D's an MC with the rhymes, no mistake everytime
Never ever going low, 'cause they only climb
And Jay's the DJ with cut, move your arms, and your butt
So D take the mic up (say what?)
I will not stop or will not quit
Because somehow at the top when I'm on the tip
That's as high on the top as you can get
And you best believe I'll be on it
So before you decide to try me out
Gonna let you all know what I'm all about
I'm a fresh MC who's on his way
To be an MC with the most to say
And to all those out there that don't know me
I go by the name of DMC
In the place to be, I will MC
The Master of a Ceremony 'cause it's easy to D
Control of the Mic is so Devastated
That all other rappers you will soon be hatin
No matter what race, creed or color
When we perform they don't get duller

Professor, compressor, impressor to the lesser

And if any, wanna get with D
I crash and bash and smash his ass for free

I educate and straight from off the streets
HARD, like a man was born to be
It just just happened in rap I was born to be

And I'm Run my son the fun has just begun
And some are slum, and make em sell til
Crumbles crumb they hum, those fools will come
And none have never done Run, Jay!

Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black ??? on in to the early mornin'

I keep it hardcore like you never saw
You be wanna be!

You wanna be...
You wanna be...
You know you wanna be...
You wanna be...
You wanna be...
You wanna be...
You know you wanna be...
You wanna be...
You wanna be C.L. Smooth,
Pete Rock,
One time.
(Pete Rock)
I'm the man you see, in the place to be
I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
and after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the Kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawnin'
Mecca? (Yo!)
You want the mecca? (Yo!)
I'll make a funky beat so we can blow, check it out
Pete Rock's the beat knock, put you in a headlock
and now all the outty out flock is down with the king

And you know about his ladies and all his babies
You just want a ride, to get inside
And run around town like Bonnie & Clyde
But see the moves you're makin' the route you're takin'
Will lead the heart breaking and I'm not mistaking
You like his money, you'll be his honey
It's truth, no excuse, you're a great big dummy
Dumb girl
Dumb girl
I wish I knew why a girl like you
Wants to do all the things that you do
I know you want a man, but you should understand
JC ain't D, shouldn't be his fan
You're not just fine you're out of your mind
And I wrote this rhyme just for your kind
Don't be misled remember what I said
The rhymes are rock, but surely not one in your head
Dumb girl
Dumb girl
Now you are the flyest girl in the whole school
But they don't call you fly, they call you fool
Because you don't go to class you will not pass
You'd like to go but you're too slow because you're going to fast
And I can tell that you're dumb when you walk in the place
Walkin' around with your thumb cold stuck in your face
Always sinning never winning cause you're last in the race
You get high into the line think that measures the ace
Dumb girl
Stupid, the girl is
Dumb dumb dumb
Now you're a stupid sex fiend with no real power
Had four guys in the bathroom, and your last in the shower
Always guys call you fast but I call you slow
Always slipping or giving somebody a blow
Giving every guy a try at the wink of an eye
There's something you're missing that money can't buy
When it comes to love you're even hated by Cupid
Just silly, dilly, silly, just plain stupid
Dumb girl
Stupid
Dumb girl
The girl is.... dumb
I hope you listen to the words that I speak
I'm not playing, what I'm saying could never be weak
You should use your brain, but you don't have one
And when it comes to sense you don't have none
YO YO you should know where I am coming from
But, you're just dumb ditty dumb ditty ditty dumb dumb
Dumb girl
Dumb with a capital D
Dumb girl
Stupid as can be
Break down
Dumb
The girl is
Dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb girl
Dumb girl

And by all means necessary
My vocabulary is very extensive and extensive
So hard t'll put you in intensive care

And the sparks fly day and night dark and light

Get outta my face don't base no race for time

Rip lip or trip and I'll test
Get out my face or we can go head up DMC
No, no, yo! You don't understand me
In this land where they always try to ban me
Type me the stereotype of a face

The way she looked that day...was sayin'
Somethin' 'bout the way my afro's growin'
Well is it funky? I don't care
Is she jackin' my 'fro or my fame?
Do she want me because of my name?
I like the ladies sweet and serious
Not those 'hos that plays the game
On every Tom, Dick and Harry
Shawn, Jerry, John, Nick, Curly, Moe and Larry
You thinkin' you marry? Well you're crazy?
My baby you won't carry
'Cause I like the girl that's low-key
That's always gotta be to be with me
And I'll take her to all exotic places

Seen this girl on the block by the boondock
On the spot she was down for the bootknock
Droptop she was rockin to Tupac
Said: yo D not me, what you got
He says, ""you's a vivrant thang,
vivrant thang, vivrant thang""
Seen a girl so crystal clean, I mean
Since I've been on the scene I dream of girls
In tubetops booze on rooftops
Now this girl, who cruises to Tupac
Get this girl in my bathtub, give her a back rub
My bathroom's like a nightclub
A few ladies in my den fondling
A few ladies in the den, so bring some Jello in
And a mighty fine fellow in like myself
To organize the panties on the shelves
[Chorus]
Them girls, them girls
Them girls I do adore
I like em' sweet and fine
I genuine, divine
All kinds I love them all
Them girls, them girls
Them girls around the way
I like a lemon to a lime
The women so fine sometimes they make me say:
Had a fly girl cold called her honey
went and spent up all my money
Fred went to bed with a girl from Cali, what?!
He told me she was looking for a dollar, dollar.
E to MC that don't get played
Girls gonna take it, but they don't get paid
They might get naked, but they don't get laid
The school needs girls since I made first grade
I like the small girls, I like the tall girls
I like all the girls fuckin dirty call girls
So Run, let's bring the girls in
And their girlfriends, but don't let the squirrels in
As for the boyfriends step on joint
When the girlfriends come home and bring Limp Bizkit toys in
I like to rake(wreck) shit when I'm in the snake pit
But no silicone cause' I don't like the fake shit

Them girls, them girls [x8]
Yo, yo girls go lie lie
Girls galore, girls I never even seen before
The way they sway, that makes me smile
And Run get the dimes on the top of the pile
Girls are freaking things are good
Girls can fill up my neighborhood
But don't take my sunshine I'll be O.K.
As long as them girlies are here to stay

'cause when it comes to rap, I'm the epitome
the rapper's idol, and my title is Kool Moe Dee

It's not Michael Jackson, and this is not thriller

Well I'm one of the chosen few
so when you need that lips just to get you through
all you have to do is say Special K

And by the time I'm through you will agree
No other MCs rock the house like me

And ain't another rapper who's as bad as me
I got a high powered voice, I'm the party people's choice
I got so many rhymes, you gotta take invoice

Now party people, I'm so happy I don't know what to do
'cause I'm the MC with the rhymes, cold down with the crew
Rock from Africa to France and then to Kalamazoo
And every place that I play I hear a yeah, not a boo

You need a guy to show you in and where react
You need a motivator, that means you need me
Special K, huh, from the Treacherous Three

Since I was only 15 I had to listen
To what was said for my parent was a christian
I went to school and saw all my friends do it
But I said no 'cause I don't want my nose to grow
They started tripping on me, busting and flipping on me
So I had to front and say yo, true, stick it on me

This is a black man's might
I heard a sister say she don't like darker shades of black
On a man 'cause that's wack
But to my light skin sister can't you tell

Run the water, grab the shower cap and get buckwhyled

Which means black school in Swahili
And there is where I learned black history
And how to be the best that I can be
I went back and now the school is closed
There is nowhere for black youth to go
To be taught by brothers and sisters who knows what it means
To be a black child or a white teen
In the end the youth is being mistreated
Which means the world is being cheated

Dane was never taught her life was worth something
But when people don't try to improve it makes me want to hurt something

DJ's and MC's  coming up next is the one and only
incredible  Jam Master
Yo  back up off the ropes  punk
[Run]
Beats to the rhyme  the rhyme I just made
Party at the jammie til lights the night fade
Trooping for the feature we all get paid
So let's go
[D.M.C.]
Yo! D that's me  the King  the MC
Rhyme get mine on the t o p
Can another MC ever rock this beat? (Hell yeah)
[Run-D.M.C.]
It's like the A the B to the C
It's easier than (1, 2, 3)
(He's Jam Master Jay, I'm D.M.C.)
So here's Run
It's time for we to cease (So what?)
So rhymers speak your peace
Why? Cause you can't touch (Jam Master Jay)
Cause he's number (1, 2, 3, 4, hit it)
Dance to the rhythm, the rhyme, the cold flow
Chance to give em is done I told yo
For these routines like 1983
It's just a little reminder
So those suckas is kinder
A little message from (Run-D.M.C.)
[Run]
Cuts for days will amaze and maze
But will make you sad to tan all the dance aways
Got the mic, the man, the master plan
But the ram, the jam
(Know I am?) Goddamn!
Spins he wins, clocking MS ends
To his friends he lends, lotta joy he sends
Jay lose today, this is what I say
(Dick in your mouth all day)
[D.M.C.]
My beats were played and laid rhymes made
Jay DJ'ed and I got paid
Made something out of nothing (Yo D that's true)
Yes my brother I would do it for you
I roam in the zone of the microphone
And I'm on the throne but I'm not alone
Got bones of steel and not of stone
I'm known to be prone and make your momma moan
[Run]
Time for the rhyme so let the stars shine
Shame for the fame and the name combined
Run for the fun but you can gimme your ring
Show I gotta go so now a word from the King
[D.M.C.]
Hardcore, rhymes galore, giving you more
And like I said before...
Beats to the rhyme the name of this jam
D that's me and that's who I am
Rocking on the mic cause you know I can
You gotta understand I don't give a damn
[Run]
Jay hit a play today I must say
Hooray to the way that is A-OK
As we wax the tracks all the DJ's play
With (dick in your mouth)
A little (dick in your mouth)
A big (dick in your mouth all day)

So people in the place here the big beat comes
Here we come here we come here we kitty come come
Come on everybody let's all get down
What we have is a brand new sound
So nobody out there be misled
We make up all these rhymes inside our head
The other emcees cannot compete
When we rap on the mic to this big beat
The beat is big, it's kind of large
And when we're on the mic, we're in charge
It's like that y'all (that y'all) it's like that y'all (that y'all)
It's like that a th-that a like that y'all (that y'all)
Cool chief rocker, I don't drink vodka

Go to school everyday (Huh!)
0n the side make 'em pay (Huh!) (Huh!)
'Cause I'm rockin' on the mic till the break of day
And all the things I do make me a star
And you can be too if know who you are
So put your mind tuned to go real far
And next thing is to know what happens so far
Liggy liggy liggy liggy liggy liggy liggy

rhymes that you've never even heard before
now if you say you hurt my mind we gonna have to fight
cause I've just made the motherfuckers joggle last night
kick of your sheet relax your feet
party all down to the DJ Run beat
the beat to get you off to get you outta your seat
make you booby to a savvier so that you know what you need
wait a time a minute don't break on me
the rhymes come faster and the DJ cheats
the DJ cuts the record for the value below
while you boogie you ass till it's time to go
and when it's time to go girl takin' you home
so straighten you dress up but on the way it's so cold
And I'm the microphone master super rhyme maker
I get def when as the others get shaky
It's me DMC in the place to be
And I still got the same old harmony
I'm the devastating mic controller
The word we say and the chief rocks puller
That beat boy made for the beat girls
Rock through the rhymes in the turntable turns
Some brand new was born to turn
And it could be init rap king Alex Sore
Rock about the cheats and the games we play
See DJ come everyday
We rock round town think hard rhymes
Get paid real well don't have charge
We've got big pocket seen
Can't remand that wanted reward ready is to pay
We've got all out there, do what they abase
Place the game with the boy in arrest
And the game's so light or really for
He put your hand up to play until the game is done
So play all to the break of dawn
As we rock ya all to the early mornin'
He's Jammaster J the big big blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
It's 83 and he's a little faster
And only practise make a real Jammaster
JMJ are the letters of his name
Cuttin' and sratchin' are the aspects of his game
so check out the scratcher as his cuts the jam

then take a wow 1 2 3 Jammaster J Run DMC

Three the hardest from Hollis
If we didn't lock the blocks a lot of blocks'd be jobless, son
Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay say, hey!
Come come and see the way we play ?? away day
In and out, sendin shouts out the mouth
If in doubt, chin em out, grill his mouth and send his snout South
I'm out - of course the force from up North
Ain't up for grabs yup whattup then it's up yours!
You see we ain't open up doors - that's BUSINESS
We knocked those things off the motherfunkin HINGES
Whoever said we fell off, I have no taste for it
We couldn't fall off a skateboard, don't WAIT for it
Cruise the city hard, tell your city we're in charge
Watch it gitty-God or you'll be head and titty scarred
?? alliance by my mind and rhymes are more than shiny
So in the 90's watch your tiny heiny get grimy
[Chorus: Run-D.M.C.]
Hit 'em hard, catch him off his guard - what?
Hit 'em hard, catch him off his guard - what?
Hit 'em hard, hit 'em hit 'em hard - what?

The hard hitter, I come to cross a critter splitter
Gold digger, better get a babysitter
I'm Daddy, cruisin like a Caddy braggin
Rag rag em, bruise em in a paddywagon
Pull a magnum, point it and I spat it at him
Then I stab him, grab the mics and start to blab em
Like a dragon, the breath of death is goin off
I'm comin hard, I'm one with God I'm never soft
I'm a father, to all the kids I'm gettin rid of
Livin larger, I give it to the highest bidder
So ante up, and come on out your pockets punk
The punk rocker, is gonna lock ya in a trunk
I pull a pump, and bump you off into a dump
You hear a thump, because I had to stump a rump
From Hollis Ave., I'll have you on the boulevard
I pull your card, word to God you know I'm hittin hard
[Chorus]

Well as the mode explode (Run..) ?? when I'm layin one
Listen what I'm sayin (Run..) no playin are you obeyin Run

You can't say I'm not
And in case you forgot
I'm the king of rock
I'm the devastating mic controller DMC
And can't nobody mess around with me
I'm the king of rock, rap, and of rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels real fine
If the flow is made of Jay
Then I will play
A rhyme with sound put down
For the rhymes I say
We flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together let's rock
Hit it Run
Few try to punch the clock
While I rock this spot
I better known to the world as the king of rock
I like to speak my piece when I'm on the mic
I'm the best or at least I'm the one you like
And when I serve, you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve you got the nerve to make a triple play
Now how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Daryl, but you can call me D
Hit it Run
It's cold gangster hard rock nonstop hip-hop
And it's headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race plays color, country, county, or creed
In all of the places that I MCed
B boy badness to the highest degree
And you cant be a boy unless you be D
You cant bust a cherry or crush a grape
And if you ain't got the state you're in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together let's rock
Do you really know what's going on
I was conceived when I was born
I once was lost but now I'm found
Tell your bunch I'm boss, I run this town
I leave all suckers in the dust
Those dumb muthafuckas cant mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, Let's rock
Hit it Run
I was struck from the start performing art
Climbing up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We won't rob but our job is to get paid
Cause Run has fun if Jay will play
And I got one more rhyme to say
Now how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Daryl, but you can call me D
Hit it Run
I was born son of Byford
Brother of Al
Betty's my mama and Run's my pal
It's McDaniels not McDonald's
These rhymes are Daryl's, but the burgers are Ronald's!
I went down my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother and D

Unemployment at a record highs
People coming  people going  people born to die
Don't ask me  because I don't know why
But it's like that  and that's the way it is
[D.M.C.]
People in the world tryin to make ends meet
You try to ride car  train  bus  or feet
I said you got to work hard  you want to compete
It's like that  and that's the way it is
Huh!
[Run & D.M.C. alternate lines for the remainder of the song]
Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me the last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
Wars going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Huh!
You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You noticed one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is

As we let the music play
This is dedicated to Runny Ray
From all the homeboys around the way
So def it won't get an F
Jay receives an A for his essay
Spins til you're dizzy
Born to get busy
Is he the Jam Master?
Isn't he, or is he?
And my name is D.M.C.
The K-I-N-G
The car that I drive is called a Caddy
The drink that I drink is called O.E.
And I wear my glasses so I can see
My homeboy right next to me
His name is DJ Run
Shoots a gift like a gun
Slays suckers one by one
Rather chill than kill
Cause the killing's no fun
So together forever
Crew be tougher than leather
We gonna slay the bad ones
Until there are none
Run-D.M.C.'s award nominees
The K-I-N-G's of all M-I-C's
Like Hercules, with rhymes like these
Never crackin not lackin and I still pull G's
Well I ah, impress the bad, suggest the rest
Who be less when they 'fess, against the test
And I insist that this, with a flick of the wrist
Will be kid not dissed at the top of the list
So go a-head, and stand, check out the man
With a clan, never ran, and in demand
So just a
Bust a rhyme
It's a must cause I'm
Funky fresh, in the flesh AND YOU KNOW THE TIME
Why don't ya, bust it son
Cause I'm number one
Just do it, pursue it
Hit it Run!
Yo I'm flowin and showin rocks knots and shockin the mind
I'm only chillin and killin, so won't you check out the rhyme
Meetin greetin and seatin, suckers all in a row
Crashin mashin and bashin, my name is Run, call me Joe
Fat as ever and clever, and never second to none
Wearin leather and better (What's your name?) DJ Run
But in the summer's a bummer, cause I leave em at home
Just Adidas and me, and Lee and D on the phone
Diggin eyein the crown, sellin skills by the pound
Makin breakin and takin all of the suckers around
Puttin fear in the heart, at the top of the chart
Stunning gunning and funning, cause Run's running this art
DJ's facing the rage, never losing a show
Cause when the set is a match, then they're ready to go
Swervin curvin deservin, the grass grow everyday
Cause makin money ain't funny, ain't that right JMJ?
Full in effect, set comin correct
Yet gainin respect, still breakin a neck
I'm coolin and chillin, not foolin with illin
On the mission it's thrillin, and I'll make a killin
My higher desire, go high and then fly ya
Makes me the messiah, I'll neve retire
I'm spankin and bankin high rankin and skankin
Improvising, suprising, I'm rising and flaking
My boys on the side, the front and the back
A Cadillac and a stack, for the King Darryl Mack
Not workin for free, pocket full with a G
And they always ask me, D.M.C., ""How'd ya do it Dee?""
On the go with Joe, makin pay with Jay
All day, WHY? Cause I'm livin that way
One wonders, WHAT? How it gets done
I hear questions, FROM WHO? From everyone
I'm cool.. I broke the rule
Breakin all but law, when I break fool
Cause I'm the man.. that was born to rule
Every girl in the world, and make them drool
It's easy to be, it's easy to D
It's easy to G, it's easy to me
Wanna know how I do it, got a goal, I pursue it
Got the soul, to get to it, you was told, so you knew it
The answers, from questions, I'm tellin to thee
Cause they always ask me, D.M.C., ""How'd ya do it Dee?""

To the T-O-P and see D, you know, we know
The way today, I say I'm not a Leo

The sign of mine is wild, keep grinnin
This half-style is wild, and I'm winnin
Roll, stroll, control and I'm coolin
The king of rock and roll, and I'm rulin
I rock, shock, get stopped, and I'm droppin
I pop hip-hop, I'm hip-hoppin
Receive a G for Lee, while I'm throwin
It's D, ya see, it's me, I'm not goin
Munch, crunch us, you gotta take us out, we're hotter
Team is mean, a lotta work involved, we're smarter
Dee, Jay, Run, no jokin, hot as hell, we're smokin
Punks rough toughs, we're yokin, news is crude, are chokin
Out like that, not going in like men, we're growin

Because every performer is only a goner

Sophisticated sound not soft or sour

It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
You should have gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
When you feel you fail sometimes it hurts
For a meaning in life is why you search
Take the bus or the train, drive to school or the church
It's like that, and that's the way it is
Here's another point in life you should not miss
Do not be a fool who's prejudiced
Because we're all written down on the same list
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
Huh!
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is

Unemployment at a record highs
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows

Bills rise higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play

Street soldiers killing the elderly
Whatever happened to unity?

You take it home, plug it in, BAM! You got beat
It's not funny when you buy a house with all you got
And the day you go to see it, it's a vacant lot
It's not funny
It's not funny
It's not funny when you come to work late
You have the key to the office, and the boss had to wait
It's not funny making money on a regular basis
And losing every dime betting on the races

It's not funny when you have a show and thousands come
And your drummer bring the sticks, but forgets his drum
It's not funny when you see three cars you like
And your pocket can only buy a 3-speed bike

It's not funny when we got on the wrong plane
We wanted to go to LA, but we were headed for Spain

Uh huh
Ah hah
Ah hah
See when y'all heard that
All I'm doin is laughin' at all y'all niggas that been frontin'
On my man's in there man, these niggas started this shit man
[Run]
When I come to the show that I rock
And the flow that I drop
Y'all know Run kills the mic
Can't forget about the olds that I got
And the rolls in the spot
Ya'll know I didn't steal it right?
How ya gonna take an old song been around so long
So so def done made it tight
Done went from a DJ to an MC to the REV like overnight
Everybody lookin' players get shook when
Rev Run walk up in the spot
Even though the crooks that
Be livin' up out in Brooklyn
Just can't help but point a lot
Everywhere I go now
People say ""oh wow""
Cause they know how I get
It don't matter if it's motown
All the way to your town
You can't slow down my hits
[Jermaine Dupri]
Can't slow it down man
Think about this
From 1983 to 2000, its 2001
And these niggas are still on the run
Y'all niggas just crazy
Ya'll out here tryin' to front
Like they ain't the reason nigga went and bought a pair of shell toes
The f*ck is wrong with y'all
[Run]
People wanna hear Rev Run say
Cuz I got dough that I must be a type of fraud
But you know that the thing that's funny
If God made money, then how rich is the Lord
Went got JD , made me crazy play me up in the club
Got a brand new Mercedes for my lady
Bustin me I'm older
To a Bentley Arnage that come out the garage
On the side of a grand prestigious home
Y'all ask if I'm blessed, by God player,
What you thought, what Rev you see on ______?
Gotta make these dollars, comin outta Hollis
Got my collar on two, I got the rhyme on the beat
And the vibe from the street and now the rest is on you
[Jermaine Dupri]
The rest is on me man
Let me let j'all know somethin'
The first rap group to get on MTV
Heard heavy ya heard me
And then they go turn around and resurrect Aerosmith like
You know what I mean, there ain't none of that,
Know what I'm sayin
And if it weren't for these cats man y'all wouldn't know
Nothin' about no LL Cool J or Beastie Boys you know what I mean
And this comin' from me I'm lookin at it man
Since I've been 13 years old, now I been watchin these cats man
I aint no old nigga, but I know nigga ya heard me
Ya know what I'm sayin', so stop all that frontin' man
Stop all your frontin' ya heard me
Ya hear
[Run]
Don't forget the hits that I made on the gig that I played
If ya had love back in the day
Just raised up my kicks and changed up the spit
And turned into the Run y'all love today
I picked the mic back up, came right back up
To the top where I'm supposed to be (JD: supposed to be)
And when the track light up y'all come back right up
Y'all playa's too close to me
[Jermaine Dupri]
You know what I used to like?
The way my man used to come up on stage
And grab the mic and just throw the damn stand
Across the stage man
Then he used to tell his man like
""Yo D, come right here in the middle of the stage,
Grab yo dick and say what you gotta say""
And you know what D used to say
He used to say
""Party people, your dreams have now
Been fullfilled, get out your seats and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we not just rough, we more than tough""
And when it comes to shit like this hah we got enough
Know what I mean? you know who the f*ck I am
You know my name, you know my game
Its So So Def, Run DMC

They say I'm overrated, Musicians really hate it
My name is Run, I'm number one, It's very complicated
You might think it's a snap, a snap to make a rap
Well if you do, me and my crew will tell you that's some crap

It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's Tricky...Tr-tr-tr-tricky (Tricky) Trrrrrrrrrrricky
I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said ""It's not that easy""
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
And in the city it's a pity cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

When I wake up people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father cos he's down with me
It's Tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time

We are not thugs, we don't use drugs

Two years ago  a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def a then it went this way
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside  his Cad illac
The chaffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin on the microphone
And then we talkin autograph, and here's the laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see ahh, ah that's the life, ah that I lead
And you sucker MC's is who I please
So take that and move back catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin in the world, that Run'll ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a b-boy stance
And rock on the mic and make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above
I'm rockin on the mic and you can call me Run-Love
I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin girls just a-move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
it's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife
You're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin on the ave, chillin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
Ah with the one two three, three to two one
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker MC's, you bad face clown
You five dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
Youse a sucker MC, and you're my fan
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Klein
Comin from the wackest, part of town
Tryin to rap up but you can't get down
You don't even know your english, your verb or noun
You're just a sucker MC you sad face clown
So D.M.C. and if you're ready
The people rockin steady
You're drivin big cars get your gas from Getti
[D.M.C.]
I'm D.M.C. in the place to be
I go to St. John's University
And since kinde-garten I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love the style
I'm an MC you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
with who me myself and my microphone
All my rhymes are sweet delight
So here's another one for y'all to bite
When I rhyme, I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
Cause it takes a lot, to entertain
And sucker MC's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop
You gotta let em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make (a lot of sense)
You got to know where to start (when the beats come in...)

Sucker MC's should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' till I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect
They called us and said we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a purple treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?
Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll. I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees will bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run-DMC rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send
Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these
PERIOD!

And other rappers can't stand us, but give us respect
They called us ill, we're gettin iller,
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not ""Thriller""
I'm one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devestating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a verbal treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?
Now we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll, I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You've got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees won't bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run, DMC rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spend my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MC's, you gotta say please
Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down weeds
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-DMC
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be beat
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say, shall set a trend
Because a devestating rap is what we send
Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch. I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack, to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MC's, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin' hard times, for sucker MC's
Cause they don't make no songs like these
PERIOD!

Give it up for:
Jam Master Jay and?
[Run-DMC]
Run, DMC
Oh yeah, all the way down
For you Funky, Ah yeah
It's like that y'all, we don't stop, tell em? D
Throw your hands in the air, come on!
And wave em? like you just don't care, everybody!
And if you're ready for Run (DMC) somebody say Oh yeah
(Oh yeah) Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
And we won't stop hoods, we don't stop
This is Hollis rap (come on), everybody scream!
For all you sucker MC's perpetrating the front
You ice-cold act, keep the crowd go mourn
You're the kinda guy that girls ignore
(Whatcha drivin??) I'm driving Caddies,
Your fixing a Ford (What's your name?)
My name is Joseph Simmons, but my middle name's lord
And when I'm rapping on the mic you should all applaud,
Because we're wheeling (dealing), we've got a funny feeling
We rock from the floor, up to the ceiling
We're movin?, you're groovin?, it has been provin?
We calm the savage beast, because are music is soothing
We create it, relate it, and often demonstrate it
We dis the sucker MC's and make the other suckers
hate it
We're rising, suprising, and often hypnotizing
We always tell the truth, and then we never slip no lies in
No curls, no braids, peasy hair to still get paid
Jam Master cuts the record of the down and cross fade
So Jay?
(Kidrock)
Bawitdaba-da bang-da bang-diggy-diggy-diggy

Said the boogie-said up jump the boogie
Hey ya, who is this? Yeah, who's this?
Who is this guy? Yeah, who's this?
Who are you? What is your name?
Yo, tell em? who you are!)
My name is KID! (WHO?)
It's Kid baby, it's KID
Bawitdaba-da bang-da bang-diggy-diggy-diggy

Bawidaba-da bang-da bang-diggy-diggy-diggy
Said the boogie-said up jump the boogie
Bawidaba-da bang-da bang-diggy-diggy-diggy
Shake your butt for your Kid rock!
And this is for the questions that don't have any answers
The midnight glances and the topless dancers
The gander freaks, cars packed with speakers
The G's with the 40's and the chicks with beepers
The northern lights and the southern comfort
And it don't even matter if their vanes are punctured
All the crackheads, the critics, the cynics
All my heroes in the methadone clinics
All you bastards in the I.R.S
For the crooked cops and the cluttered desks
For the shots of jack, and Pints of love.
And the fifth's of stress
I've got the party in the bag, I've got no sweat
For the hookers all trickin' out in Hollywood
And for my hoods of the world misunderstood
I said it's all good, yo and it's all in fun
Get in the pit and try to love someone!
Ah! Yeah!
Ladies and gentlemen; give it up for Aerosmith
(Joe C!)
Oh shit!
(Aerosmith)
Ah yeah
Backstroke lover always hidin' neath? the cover
Gonna talk to ya my daddy say
He said ""You ain't seen noting
Till you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways""
I met a cheerleader, was a real young bleeder
All the times I can reminisce
And the best thing lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss, like this,
Like this, like this,
like this, like this
See-saw swingin' with the boys in the school
And her feet flyin' up in the air
Singin' hey diddle-diddle with the kitty in the middle
Of a swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
But she told me how to walk this way
She told me to:
Walk this way, talk this way
Walk this way, talk this way
She told me to:
Walk this way, talk this way
She said:
Walk this way, talk this way
But just give me a kiss-kiss-kiss
OOH YEAH
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Like this! Yeah-yeah, Yeah

Krush Groovin', Body Movin' (Body Movin') [8x]
[Fat Boys]
Now we came a long way, and now we're here
The hot house rockers, crushers of fear
Three bad rockers, who gain recognition
And we are the ones, that are in position
To hang with the best, and if you don't believe
Check out the rhyme that we conceive
Let it be known, that there is no other
That can rock the house, like these three brothers
Prince Markie Dee, with Kool Rock-ski
And the Human Beat Box completes the three
We testify, and we'll last forever
Pumping and Jumping, to stand together
Taking and Breaking, Laying and Slaying
All you sucker mcs best start praying
Cause Run-DMC, Kurt, Sheila and us
We keep moving and grooving like the number 10 bus
Krush Groovin', Body Movin' (Body Movin') [4x]
[Run-DMC]
Krush Groove ya, Body Move ya
We gotta prove that this groove that we use ah
This is something that we don't rehearse
DMC is second, and I rhyme first
Now this is how we run it down the line
DMC is second, I'm first to rhyme
So why don't you call me uno, and D's for dos
Because I rock parties from coast to coast
I'm known to the world as chilly most
MC of the party and I'm the host
And I'm the one and only, the only one
And he goes by the name of DJ Run
You see they call me Run, but I never ran
In a B-Boy stance is how I stand
And Darryl Mac has cold got my back
This is funky fresh stuff, it's not an act
I'll pass it to D, I'll pass it back
That's the way it is, cause it's like that
Krush Groovin', Body Movin' (Body Movin') [4x]
[Sheila E]
I'm Sheila E and I want to say
that I'm a super high powered, cold-krushin' lady
and I'm here to talk about this thing called rap
to all the party people at the party that's packed
and you know that I'm precious, could never be lesser
Sheila E rocks the best under pressure
To all of you hip-hop be-bop fans
get out of your seats and just clap you hands
get down, don't clown to the funky sound
cause the beat is dropping all over the town
Kurtis Blow, you could never be weak
get on the mic and let me hear you speak
[Kurtis Blow]
Yes, yes y'all, ah yes, yes y'all
I'm Kurtis Blow and I'm the king and I'm the best y'all
And I'll tell you why, cause I'm fresh y'all
From the north, the south, east and west y'all
Now, I've rocked house parties in the B-Boy stance
and never, ever gave a sucker mc a chance
'cause I'm a rhyme creator, crime motivator
I'm chillin' on you now, but I can serve you later
Check out my crew that can never be beat
Ah Kurtis Blow, Sheila E and Run-DMC
and to the Fat Boys, and now you're down by law
Down with the best now let's even the score
Now just throw your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
And if you want to bust a move like the Krush Groove
Somebody say ""Oh Yeah"" (Oh Yeah)
And you don't stop, that Krush Groove rock until it hit the top
Somebody Scream!

And I can't stand the thought of losing you

Meet me at the altar in your white dress
We ain't getting no younger we might as well do it
Been feeling you all the while girl I must confess

Hangin out late night
Girl you done made me change my life
Every since you met me
Keys to the Bentley
Now they call you the preacher's wife

Hard as can be, so don't bother me

His name is Jay, he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall yes y'all and he's down with me

I'm talked about because I turn it out
You cannot count this large amount
of rhymes I got that rock this spot

If the titles at stake, then I would take
?Paving? the title, will be taken
I'm for real, I'm not faking
Suckers are shivering and, dead shaking
I think ya scared if I'm not mistaken
I gain respect and if I'm correct
They'll awe like a ball that I have check
If the shots they take have no effect
The punk tried to dunk, but he broke his neck
'cause I rock harder and I, get farther
You wanna battle D, hey please, don't bother
to waste your time, messin wit my rhyme
The only kick you get out of it is in the behind

Kings from Queens from Queens come Kings
We're Raising Hell like a class when the lunch bell rings

Like you was Lois Lane and I was Clark Kent
I spend and I spend and you spent and you spent
Now my house with a mouse is a roach with a tent
Mary, Mary... Why ya buggin'?
Mary, Mary... I need your huggin'
Mary, Mary, Mary, you cold thumb suckin'
Lookin' for you, but you keep duckin'
I wanna find you, I gotta tell you somethin'
So just be quiet and don't say nuttin'!
Mary, Mary, Mary, why you out there stuntin'?
Supposed to be with me, but now you're frontin'
We started out new, you used to be true
Now you're buggin', what's wrong with you?
Mary, Mary... Why ya buggin'?
Mary, Mary... I need your huggin'
Now, this girl Mary I knew so well
I met her on the road in a fly hotel
High on the heels and never fell
Clubs and the pubs is where she dwelled
Story about Mary was well to tell
She seemed to scheme for a dream to sell
She spent some nights locked in a cell
I knew Mary well 'cause she raising hell
Mary, Mary... Why ya buggin'?
Mary, Mary... I need your huggin'
It's not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin' 'bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she's crazy and I'll say very
Livin' in a house that's out on the prairie
I worry about Mary cause Mary is scary!
""Mary, Mary.."" Why ya buggin'?
""Mary, Mary.."" I need your huggin'
etc

And roamed all over coliseum floors
I stepped onstage at Live Aid
All the people gave and the poor got paid
And out of speakers I did speak
I wore my sneakers, but I'm not a sneak
My Adidas touched the sands of foreign lands,
With mike in hand I cold took command
My Adidas and me, close as can be,
We make a mean team, my Adidas and me
We get around together, now and forever
And we won't be mad when we're caught in bad weather
My Adidas..
My Adidas..
My Adidas
Standin on 2 Fifth St.
Funky fresh and yes cold on my feet
With no shoestring in em, I did not win em
I bought em off the ave with the black Lee denim
I like to sport em that's why I bought em
A sucker tried to steal em so I caught em and I thwart em
And I walk down the street and bop to the beat
With Lee on my legs and adidas on my feet
And now I just standin here shooting the gip
Me and D and my Adidas standing on 2 Fifth
My Adidas..
My Adidas..
Now
Me and my Adidas do the illest things
We like to stomp out pimps with diamond rings
We slay all suckers who perpetrate
And lay down law from state to state
We travel on gravel, dirt road or street
I wear my Adidas when I rock the beat
On stage front page every show I go
It's Adidas on my feet high top or low
My Adidas..
My Adidas..
Now enough Adidas possessed by one man is rare
Myself homeboy got fifty pair
Got blue and black cause I like to chill
And yellow and green when it's time to get ill
Got a pair that I wear when I'm playin ball
With the heal inside make me 10 feet tall
My Adidas only bring good news
And they are not used as selling shoes
They're black and white, white with black stripe
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of our famous university
We took the beat from the street and put it on TV
My Adidas are seen on the movie screen
Hollywood knows we're good if you know what I mean
We started in the alley, now we chill in Cali
And I won't trade my Adidas for no beat-up Bally's
My Adidas..

And I say.. the brother's about to get naughty!
Rockin you on down.. to the last.. STOP!
[Run]
See them on the corner, scheamin a scam
Makin plans beat the man that'll put him in ?amb's?
Cut for the loot to group, hit a troop or bank
No thanks to the brothers in blue
Freeze stay at ease, nigga get to your knees
Seen cash in the back, about a hundred G's
Step to the next, got a scam with checks
Cold stole a bankroll from plenty of ?? then
Up to The Ave., a cab to the lab
To make a stop to drop off the money in the bag
And then send a friend that's been down
To do a job to rob a brother in town
Livin and givin a damn, two different things
The brother dig diamond rings
It's not about makin the money, but the money is taken
Shake em down, flip em out, then break em
He'll break a leg, to get the money
A diggy diggy don't forget he'll break a law, seen
Ain't a damn thing funny bout a nigga named Sonny
But the brother's about to get naughty
The brother's about to get naughty! [4x]
[D.M.C.]
Starin and tearin in my direction
Selection is vexin, I brought protection
Suspicious, frisk us, ? has to diss us
Scoldin and holdin me 'gainst my wishes
Searchin my ride, my body, my soul
Tryin to find some kind of substance control
Maybe someone is carryin a gun
No, nothing, no one has none
Gloomy and sorry when I come clean
Yo officer, what does this mean?
My system is loud and I draw a crowd
Not only King, I'm black and I'm proud
This ride is mine, do you mind if I own
So stop tryin to rob mines and leave me alone
The officer said I saw you before
Comin out the door of a grocery store
I said to my partner there goes a man
And he's got a trouble starter, inside his hand
My man Eric Blam said stop on the cops
And then what the Blam said, you're sure to get shot
Now they ignore me cause you saw me with a 40
He thought the brothers were about to get naughty
The brother's about to get naughty! [4x]

How ya livin on the ill side, makin a livin
Driven, never givin a damn about the women and
If this is life, your wife, you're livin trife
For spite you hit the pipe every night and just fight
You're naughty, make a girl get physical
She get loose for juice and then you diss her
Pull and take another girl on a escapade
A trip around the world a what a mess you made
Another lady, gravy, maybe you're crazy
You see ? ?? today, you don't faze me
But gettin kinda hectic on the power tip
A brother gotta pay no matter how it get
Face the facts, base the crack,
Taste the stacks last, and these suckers are back
So when you see the company that claim to be
The truth you done get raw, see
Check out the three, Run-D.M.C.
And the brothers about to get naughty!
The brother's about to get naughty! [4x]

Open up the door and let the brothers in
Cause it's a sin, if we ain't down, on what's happenin
Yo what's up, you don't like the way I walk
Or I guess it's, just the way I talk or are you prejudiced
Invited to the show, threw on my afro
Jumped out the limo, get to the front, you tell me no
Yo I just came to mingle, watch the earrings jingle
Grab a cutie rub-a-dub 'til it tingle
But you wanna single me out, but I ain't did that
Check me, I ain't strapped, pull the barricade back
I'm comin in black, I know you're hard dick
Six foot bodyguard, but why should I be barred
Yo, yo, pass the 40
Cool T, Hurricane, Run and D's about to get naughty..
The brother's about to get naughty! [4x]

Groove, breathe, wind blowin the leaves
I'm at ease, can you feel the funky sensation
I might take a vacation
On the seven seasons
Reasons to be cheerful, sun shinin, Run rhymin
I'm right behind him
Jay, you know where to find him
Shinin like a diamond, if I'm lyin I'm dyin
{girrrrrrrrrrrls, drive me crazy}
So fine, goin out of my mind
I keep em goin, they sayin, I've got the rhyme
Ooze, cruise, gonna take a cruise
Jing-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling I'm never singin the blues
Afros, studios, doin shows
Four-O's I suppose, no one knows
Who's rockin the hoes, tell me that
You gotta be (funky)
[Chorus]
[Run]
Now let your body be free
And yeah, go you know
Never slow the flow til it's time to go
Cause that ain't the way you play the crowd
You gotta mingle, single girls allowed
So round em up, get a cutie in the spot
Look at the booty, do me, time to rock
And make all the girls give up the play
Get on the floor and make your day
So you're illin, still it's four o'clock
You won't leave til you see em close the spot
You gotta stay til they play the last song
Til the night gives light to the early morn'
Check the place and the taste of the bass is on the case
A negative thought that you brought just erased
Put away the nine and keep in mind
That the jam'll slam when it's party time
[Repeat chorus with ad libs to fade]

Who say slowly but surely, we gonna turn the mother out
We got more, in store, young ladies on the floor, so cool out

In other words, herbs departed

Quit, quit it, forget it
Pause, say your way with it
Pause, if you did it, admit it
Cause, you shouldn'ta did it
Next time, you think of doin a crime
Pause, and remember this rhyme
Pause for the cause, cause broken laws
Are just like broken jaws
They take a long time to heal
I'm for real, and I know the deal
Look it over, investigate
Evaluate, think!
Life is raw, and full of flaws
Before you break laws just pause!
I think that worked man [4x]
Pause
Yeah pause, this beat is dope D
I'm tellin you, this beat is dope, just slammin, it's dope
Well if it's dope, I hope it's not crack
Or coke, or nuttin like somethin you EVER smoke
And if they offer you some say NO
Or pause
The reason I wrote this rhyme, is not to climb
But just to tell all mankind
That the use and abuse of drugs - will what?
Will, blow, your, mind
Like dough makes bread, it goes straight to your head
You're misled and then you're dead
Now that's not fly, when you die
On a high
Like a trip, oooh, you make me sick
Ill, lookin like doo doo on a stick
You don't have to be a vic
Life is like a flick, so pause
Pause, p-pause, pause, p-p-pause
Alright y'all, now that you understand
My man Run never ran
I'm gonna take this mic yo my hand
And hand this to the one man band
Now pause, now pause
I'm Jay, I make up the trey
Now check out the dance that I display
It's called the pause
A new thing, on the dancefloor
First you move, then you stop
Combine the hustle, foxtrot, pop and lock
Put em all together why because
It's called the pause
Slammin, the dance is slammin
Pause, the people are jammin
Stop again, back to the groove
I show you how to move
Pause
It's simple, just like stop and go
You can pause on the fast or slow
Participate, won't you all get down
Here's a solo from my homeboy Stanley Brown
Ahh yeah, I like this R&B shit...
Pause, pause, one more time!
Yeah, do that, do that...

Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time.
Jack B. Nimble was nimble, and he was quick,
But Jam Master cut faster, Jack's on Jay's dick.
Now little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip van Winkle fell the hell asleep.
And Alice chillin somewhere in Wonderland
Jack's serving Jill a bucket in his hand.
And Jam Master Jay's making out our sound,
The turntables might wobble but they won't fall down.
Now Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing.
But, Jam Master's gettin' loose and DMC's the king.
Cause he's the adult entertainer, child educator,
Jam Master Jay, king of the crossfader.
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest.
Perfect timin' when I'm climbin', I'm rhymin' apparatus.
Lotta guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts.
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts.
And on the mix, real quick, and I'd like to say
He's not Flash, but he's fast and his name is Jay!
It goes a one, two, three and...
Jay's like King Midas, as I was told,
Everything that he touched turned to gold.
He's the greatest of the great, get it straight he's great.
Claim fame cause his name is known in every state.
His name is Jay to see him play will make you say:
""God damn, that DJ made my day!""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker,
He's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker.
Like the little old lady who lived in a shoe.
If cuts were kids, he would be due.
I'm not lying, y'all, he's the best I know,
And if I lie, my nose will grow
Like the little wooden boy named Pinochio,
And you all know how the story goes!
Tricks are for kids he plays much gigs.
He's the big bad wolf and you're the three pigs.
He's the big bad wolf in your neighborhood,
Not bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good!
There it is...
We're Run-DMC got a beef to settle
Run's not Hansel, D's not Gretel
Jay's a winner, not a beginner
His pocket gets fat while others get thinner
J-J-Jump on Jay like cows jump moons,
People chase Jay like dish and spoon
And like all fairy tales end,
You'll see Jay again my friend!
Huh!

And that's a fact y'all
And if you tried to take what is mine
I'll take it back y'all...Its' like that
Licky...
Listen party people here's a serious song
It's right not wrong, I should say right on
I gotta tell you something that y'all should know
It's not a mystery, it's history and here's how it go
Now Harriet Tubman was born a slave
She was a tiny black woman and she was brave
She was livin to be givin, there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave in this day and age
I'm proud to be black, god damn
I'm tired my man, don't worry about what color I am
Because I've seen how ill, this man can act
It could never be fiction because it is all fact
And if you get in my way, I will not turn back
I'm proud of my name, my name is Daryl Mac
I'm black and I'm proud, and I'll say it out loud
I'll share my story with the whole crowd
You know I'm proud to black y'all
And that's a fact y'all
And if you tried to take what is mine
I'll take it back y'all...Its' like that
DJ Run, and I run and sing
You could hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King, I'll do my thing
I'll say it in a rap, cause I do not sing
DMC, the man, that's causing the grief
I gotta message for this word, so listen up this brief
Like Malcolm X said, I won't turn a right cheek
Got the strength to go to lengths if you want to start peace...start peace
You know I'm proud to black y'all, and real brave y'all
And muthafucka, I could never be a slave y'all
So take that!
I want to tell you something, put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
A world full of hate, discrimination and sin
People judging other people by the color of skin
I'll take this matter in my own way, man
I ain't no slave, I ain't bailing no hay
We're in a tight position, in any condition
Don't get in my way, 'cause I'm full of ambition
I'm proud to be black, and I ain't taking no crap
I'm fresh out of the pack, and I'm proud to be black
So take that!
There was a man, an inventor, who invented so well
He invented a fortune, for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver made the peanut great
So any man would a mind could create
You read about Malcolm X, in a history text
Jesse Owens broke records, Ali broke necks
What's wrong with you man? And how can you be so dumb?
Like Dr. King said, we shall overcome

Know what I mean?
[DMC:] Queens day cash made on Hollis Ave.
Queen's Queen's Queen's
Yea yea yea, make, make it, make it seem easy
Queens day cash made on Hollis Ave.
Q-B-O-R-O nigga
Yo, from the days of encore
Niggers hung around blocks and corner stores
Huggin' gold chains of fantasies rushing the door
Niggers from Rochdale, poppin' shells snatching rings
Fly from sure kings from Queens press the one-eighteen
I have my eyes open stepping out into the world
So fiendish, Old English till I earl, growing pains
A young kid learning early how to know the game
USA roller-skate ring, marks the crews with techniques
Clean streets, hustlers, crack, cocaine
Getting back by throwing block parties and basketball games
A lot of cash made on Hollis Ave
Fast to change, high rollers was living,
Until the taskforce came
A lot of ghost-towns and memories, bad-blooded enemies
So many die with the same gangster pride that entered me
These are the old-timers, they who taught us
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters
With your flow, and I'm proud to be all that I know
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga who I'd die for, survive war
How we came a long way in solidarity
Don't let nothing try to spoil this day
To Run, D and Jay is love and my thugs salute
Cause real love is the only thing that comes above this loot
Carhard jeans that makes me think of LL's troops
Let's celebrate it's Queens day this one's for you
Queens day

Make it, make it seem easy
Queens day
Cash made on Hollis Ave Queens, Queens....
Some come out of their hometown and they never get dough
But three teens from Queens take over the world and never let go
Just regular cats you know, that just happened to blow
Not synonymous with Hollis Jay, Darryl and Joe
Ayo we made it so that others can grow
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest , mam and Nas let's go
Ain't taking credit be showing pride look at us now
Got haters mouths all opened wide wondering how
In some cases the only thing that father and son
Have in common, is their love for Run
Been the illest since day one, too advanced to ever be caught
Who's more legendary than me? That's what I thought
And if somebody want to test mine, yo watch this:
Peter Piper picked pepper:
See, I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it
Just spend a minute, I'm still the king of the world
So don't forget it:
Queens day
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga
Make it, make it seem easy
Queens day
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga
Make it, make it seem easy
Queens day
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga
Make it, make it seem easy
Queens day
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga, who I die for
This is for my Q dogs, who lit a block lights park
We grew up on Old English, summertime Roy, where this park
Used to be the chit while they had to stop
On the Ave niggas looting all the jewelry spots
Hit the shirt kings for a ill airbrush top
Let it match my Cortez Nikes
Niggas getting raw, get the back door
Coming out with bags, we used to get our gold fronts
From Eddy's gold caps, what y'all know about that
I bet the whole Queens doin' around 86 with the boom bash crew
The young guns and lost boys made the news
Queens bridge and a story too
The story is true, so let's party for the borough and chit
And everybody come outside, cause it's Queens day kid
Queens day
Cash made on Hollis Ave Q, B-O-R-O nigga
Make it, make it seem easy

Pickin' up the pieces, nephews and nieces
Chocolate in a peanut butter cup, called Reese's
Took a little break, for goodness sake
Gotta chill, get ill, cold fishin by the lake
Take a brain off rappin', 'member what happened
Listen reminisce and cold keep your foot tappin'
Darryl and Joe cause the DJ's Jason
Hear no fear, dear radio station

Run, D, and Jason, made a dedication
To those listenin', we're not dissin' em

Keep on playin song, LP playin long
Jay, D, and Joe, keep the radio stayin' on
I always say to Joe, turn on the radio
Jam Master Jay will know, that is the way to go
While Jay's DJin', I will be sayin'
Rhymes that are playin', FM or AM
On hot rotation, a winning combination
AM, FM, music modulation
Rappin' on the mic is my occupation
That's what I like, dear radio station
AM, FM, thought that I left them
Back and exact never wack no more jetset
Run made a return, D makin' me earn
Jay gotta play on the radio we burn
Hotter than a fire, kings goin' higher
Told you on the album, that was prior
Two that's tougher than, nobody rougher when
Run-D.M.C., throwin' down like a Bufferin
Relievin all pain, receiving much gain
Remaining entertaining while we entertain
For the black, white, chinese, spanish, indian, haitian
Hear no fear, dear radio station

Saw that, format, you be placin'
Records, other than, Run, go cover and
Put em on your list, people hear and discover them
Take or break the tunes that make it
D gotta be on top and shake it
Keep on rockin' it, ain't no stoppin'
My alliance droppin' science on the radio poppin' it
One top ten again, Run's gonna win again
Jay's gonna spin again, on the FM again
I coulda and shoulda and woulda, wrote a letter
But a speech that'll reach the streets is much better!

Put on my green bomber it was, freezing cold
Applied longjohns with Adidas not matching
I called up Jam Master cause I knew he was scratching
(Whassup?) Jay to the telly music, loud as hell
He said - ""Hold up Run,"" *DING DONG*, ""it's the bell!""
Jay to the door as he leaves the cut
For his eyes a surprise, ""D.M.C. WHASSUP?""
I need a little help Jay, I got a little problem
A guy like yourself, maybe you can help me solve em
I only want to know why this happens all the time
(What?) Everywhere I go, I start to rap and rhyme
I rock them in the day (yeah you rock em every night)
I rock em when I left so def I knew something was wrong (alright)
I rhyme when I am sleeping, I rhyme when I'm awake
When I was nine I said a rhyme by putting candles on my cake
I just came from the bank (you said a rhyme?) A rhyme so funny
A song about the line so long they all gave me their money
That's why I came to you, you're my friend (yes that is true)
Said maybe Jay knows what to say, he'll tell me what to do..
Hmmmm.. yo you go get Joe, and all the rhymes you made
And we'll go to the bank, AND WE CAN ALL GET PAID!
Cruisin down the block, in the sixty-six Olds
Girls are on the jock like the ride was a Rolls
Feelin kinda great, got change for the toll
Suckers gotta wait, that's your fate, poor soul
Heard you on the records and I heard you on the tapes
Stop, switch the conversation over to grapes, because
You're not bustin none, so stop fussin son

We're raising hell like a class when the lunch bell rings
The king will be praised, and hell will be raised
S-s-s-suckers try to phase us, but D won't be phased
So what's your name? DMC. The king is me
Your highness or his majesty
Now you can debate, c-c-c-c-concentrate
But you can't imitate DMC the great
Dissing all devils, causin havoc in hell
At a very high level, bass and treble shall yell
Hanging in the heavens on the sound supreme
So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
So loud like a cloud with thunder and lightning
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stopping 'cause the rocking cannot cease - BREAK!
You see, its harder than hard, not one bit soft
Courageous and contagious, so you better break off
Not a coal on a roll, did you hear me cough?
Just listen while I'm dissin 'cause you're pissin me off
Cold beading is spreading all across your face
You cant take when I break it, if that's the case
I'll go on and on, and kick the bass
So back off of the cup while I take my taste
It's highly appraised when the hell is raised
So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
The unbelieveing receiving prophecies so true
I cut the head off the devil and I throw it at you
My mighty mic control already brought his soul
The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
A black hat is my crown, symbolizing the sound
Signifying, we won't play around - BUST IT!
Rhyming and climbing beat making everyday
No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say
I am great, get it straight, 'cause that's my fate
My name is Run, I'm number one, thats how I rate
He's in the place, with the bass, and stylin grace
His name is Jay, he's here to play, and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kinda tall, yes y'all, he's down with me
From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing, I bring much to light
Like a star shining bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious is serious, I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell, and you can smell the smoke
Kicking and ticking while you're having a ball
Like chicken finger-lickin I'll be flicking you all
Don't do the bird, have you heard? Did they give you a call?
Just me and DMC cold shakin the wall
There's no fearin one hearin sound of this kind
Across the land, every man is going out of his mind
On the face of the earth, spreading like disease
Contaminating, infiltrating, like a horde of bees
Lord of lyrics, dukes of discussions
Rulers of rap and kings of cold crushin'
Pullers of people, controllers of crowds
Lingering lyrics, long-lasting and loud
Left y'all, a to the left y'all
Because I rock upon the mic real def y'all
And to the right y'all, a to the right y'all
Because I rock upon the mic all night y'all
You see, I want respect if I'm correct
They're all like a ball that I have checked
And the shots they take have no effect
The punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck
Cause I rock harder, and I get farther
You want to battle D, hey please don't bother
To waste your time, messing with my rhyme
The only kick you'll get out of it is in your behind

To all you sucker MCs perpetrating a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack, keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girls ignore
I'm driving a Caddy, you're fixing a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons but my middle name is Lord
And when I'm rockin on the mic you should all applaud
Because we're wheelin, dealin, we got a funny feelin
We rock from the floor up to the ceiling
We're groovin, you're movin, it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin'
We create it, relate it, and often demonstrate it
We dis the sucker MC, make the others suckers hate it
We're rising, suprising, and often hypnotizing
We always tell the truth, and we never slip no lies in
No curls no braids peasy head and still get paid
Jam-Master cuts the records up and down the cross fade
Because the rhymes I say, sharp as a nail
Witty as can be, and not for sale
Always funky fresh could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of the word, thats what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm a master of the mic, thats what I say
And if I didn't say that, just say it anyway
Bust into the party, cover the place
See the first thing that comes, is the music in your face
Girls on the wall, some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this, because it can't be missed
And you can't leave til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave until we're through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme, Hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough till the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade that's not debated
Nothing to deep, and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there we got the notion
And we want to see y'all in motion
Just shake, wiggle, jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side, back and forth
We're the two MCs and we gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJs better than all these bands...huh
[This verse only appears in the Vocal Dub version of Rock Box]
It's the movement of your body when you're inside a party
Tryin to do a dance just like everybody
You keep the pep in your step
Inside of your heart is where its kept
It's the movement of your feet when you hear def beats
Silence so sweet, harmony is so neat
It's the movement of the head when a rhyme is said
That I rock the livin' dead, I get you out your bed
It's the movement of you arms, to a beat that's charred
We're checkin and respectin cause it's never hard
It's the movement of your jock when he rocks the block
Ill sucker def beats all around the block
It's the movement of the 'table when it starts to spin
Round and round, and back again
Huh...!
We got all the lines, and all the rhymes
We don't drive dimes, and we don't do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear those pants they're callin'Calvin Klein
Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
Don't want nobody's name on my behind

Not a gun that's done and get done by none
The others act in fact ya just wack I kill
Why? its fun my son and Run heads the bill
Who's house? (Say What?) Run's house!
Who's house? (Say What?) Run's house!
I'm in the house y'all
I'm in the house y'all
And this is how DMC turn it out yall
I'm in the house y'all
I'm in the house y'all
And this is what DMC be about y'all
Well my name is dmc, the all-time great
I bust the most rhymes in New York state
Reporters cry, producers die
They want to be down with the king!
The wanted man from the wanted clan
Wanted by every fan from across the land
Not a g-a-n-g off the street
R-u-n-d-m-c complete!
Who's house? (Say What?) Run's house!
Who's house? (Say What?) Run's house!
Run, Run, Run, Run
Get on the mic and (MC)
Another time I take for the rhyme I make
Make me mad and sad because the fad is fake
See I do this thing so come persue this king
One minor rhyme is all you can spring
Cause I'm the best I'm def, ask the rest they left
Thats my name my game and we don't need the rep
You get the booze you lose, you suckas close your mouth
I set a trap for rap thats crap
Its run's house!
Who's house? (Say What?) Run's house!
Who's house? (Say What?) Run's house!
Some underestimate and miscalculate
My intent to create what I call the great
Till I make a song that I prove em wrong
See my song so strong it'll make em come along
Come in the door, get on the floor
Hard rock hard hitting hip-hop hardcore
Causing casualties and catastrophes
And tragedies for the sucker emcees
Use your strategies to get the best of me
You dirty rat MCs, whoever you may be
You need to go down south, you need to shut your mouth
Its all about no doubt just shout cause we talkin' 'bout....
Who's house? Run's house!
Who's house? Run's house!

And every place I hear a yay not a boo
And now a party's not a party and a jam ain't a jam
Let D is who he be, and I am who I am
Or Jay is just a DJ cutting for the two
And it's the three of us baby and we're doing the do
Five to five, equal to ten
Everywhere I go, I got a lot of girlfriend
Music is sweet, music is nice

It was December 24 on Hollis after the dark
My man Santa saw a rabbi and gave the strangest remark
He said that giving was his living and I had to take part
So I grabbed a bag of goodies and I hopped up on his cart
I laced the pockets of the poor and gave the hoodie a play
Dropped some dollars up on Hollis and I went on my way
I hear your jingle Mr. Kringle peep the single, my man
so Santa hit a brotha off and come as quick as you can!
[Chorus:]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...
[Verse 3: Ma$e]
Now all Mase know
When its eight twenty-four
He be looking at the door for the ho ho ho
Cause I know
When theres a christmas uptown
Ain't no chimney for santa to come down
[Verse 4: Puffy Daddy]
Now to me, PD I had alot
Appreciated everything that I got
Though I used to take my pops
Who aint caught me shaking the box
Cause I knew I couldn't wait till it turned 12 o'clock
[Verse 5: Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Cookies and Milk
Satin and Silk
I'm chillin in the living room, wrapped in a quilt
I'm waiting on this fat Red Suit wearing-comparing
My gifts to my homeboy next door to me
A gift here, none there, but who cares
My little sister needs a comb just to braid her nappy hair
Bbut here we go again waiting on the enemy
To slide down the chimney
Look here, that ain't reality
[Chorus:]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...
[Verse 6: Salt & Pepa]
Santa Baby, are you really real?
Chris Kringle
Let me see you make my pockets jingle (ching ching)
We need some jobs in the ghetto
Too much gangbanging where kids are playin
I hear the church bells ringing
On christmas eve
I believe
Jesus-calling me
Forget the gifts and the shopping lists
And the new kicks
Your just falling for tricks
(you better praise him)
[Chorus]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...
[Verse 7: Fredro Starr]
It's the gritty-the grimy
The low down, the shifty
Yo Sticky, christmas time in the city
Late night, stars are bright
We gettin rocked!
With the 50 St. Nicholas
Start rippin this
[Verse 8: Sticky Fingaz]
Its the Grinch who stole christmas
Climbin down ya chimney
Kids open up they gifts
They all gonna be empty
Just like mine was
I hate to say it
But if I wasnt a boy I wouldnt have had nuthin to play wit!
[Verse 9: Keith Murray]
On December 25th I knew I wasn't getting jack
when I saw Santa Claus on the corner buying crack
I ran up on him with the (blur) and asked him ""yo whats up with that?""
He said ""there aint no christmas kid"" and I can't get him back
Back in the days, Christmas was deep
My moms put presents under the tree while I played sleep
And peeped ha! Santa Claus never gave me nuthin
Seen them mad faces, lying and frontin
So do some good to the ghetto, Mr. Chris Kringle
Come and stay awhile, kick it with God's Angel
Take and acknowledge my wisdom and understand
That Santa Claus is a black man
word up
[Chorus 2x]
Santa Baby
Just slip a Benzo under the tree for me
A '98 convertible, light blue
I'm looking for a fly guy, like you
So hurry down the chimney tonight...

What's goin' on? What's goin' on? What's the deal pard?
Where you headed, son?
Yo, I'm about to go to the studio and lay a smash hit with my uncle Run, boy
Ain't he a reverend now, collecting plates at churches and chit like that?
Kid, he's spitting flames right now baby, he's at the top of his game right now
I'm a tell you, I'm a show you watch.
Y'know what I mean? He's a born-again hooligan. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
I'm Rev Run, Reverend Run, brother, son, earthquakin'
Industry shakin', you kiddin' me? We money makin'
Your money's fake son, I'll call you clay 'cause you gets playdoh
Jamel and Joey Simmons holdin' millions on the lay-low
Platinum haloes hover over heads high from hydro
Hit the dime-o with the combo, it charges up my rhyme flow
She ain't know we own conglomorates like Phat Farm Fashion
Simmons name's synonymous with this cash, it's our passion
What?
Yo basically, I'm here to rename rap
It ain't rap no more, call it Simmons incorporated, since '74
Lot of money in this fam', think about it
Me, with Run-DMC, and him over at Def Jam
Well damn, how the hell you think we livin'?
How you think it feel to be a Simmons?
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People want to know why I ain't on my brother's label
If I did, this whole rap game'd be unstable
Went over to Arista with Mr. Davis for the change in neighbours
It's only fair that we share those major papers
You could tell a cat's serious about rap, and it ain't luck
If 20 years after his first single, his name stuck
From '74 to '99 holding office as kings with a million MC's waiting in line
Keep a bail on this album, let my man Jamel rhyme
Now speed it up, uh
[Jay scratching a Run sample (Run on)]
Now I walked on ice, and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
Judge a phenomena, deadly but calm world in my palm
Dead by dawn got the right to bear arms, bring me along
Another sound boy dying, hot iron
Stuff flyin, out the hardware appliance
Baby, Momma Crying'
Sobbin' and grievin', you was at odds,
With them kids, till they made it even
Let down your guard, yes you did
Now you barely breathin'
To unaware, open season on a duck
We don't give a what
Yo, best, best to give it up
Joe and D, lets run these MCs, they phoney
Some Humphrey, they mad Bogey
Saddle up your horse, there's the sunset mosey
Jam-Master Jay deserves a trophy for this track right,
Futuristic G past tight
If that's your girlfriend, she wasn't last night, punk
Little boy style is mad chump, ain't no wimps here
Sport is extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalties, Down with the King...!
Crack's in the cradle, coke's in the spoon
Little boy flew higher than the moon
Willie wanted weapons, Wilma wanted a wool
I come to school and lay down the rule
Johnny wants to guzzle great gallons of drop
Shorty with the 40 was caught in the dark
Corner, black is a goner, didn't really want to go
Now mamma is a mourner
I spit dynamite, ignite, turn off lights, recite,
Spit poetry tight, get my squad physically hyped
Get a hundred blast for funk-master crushin' your life
Time to go now, show these fake rappers the way you go down,
Down with the kings like Smokey down with Motown
Who want to come and see, come and test me
Take about a million MCs to whet me
For Run-DMC, I let shells fly, fleein' the five with the red-eye
Niggas talking too much? Tape 'em up, leave 'em hog-tied
You're thinking about it way too hard.
'How'd he get down with the Gods?'
Kenny Cash and the Bronx cats, ready to ride with gats
Keep chicks, huggin' the sacks, you're scratching the back
I'm a shark in a shed, y'all cats is feeding fish
Now hate? and we feed 'em clips, nigga that'll leave you RIP'd (ripped)
And I'm leavin' them dry chicks crushed with bleedin' lips
Better need these chips and a CLK
After I hang plaques in the spot with Run, D and J

Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
It's never old school, all brand new
So everybody catch, the boog-a-loo flu
It's not like a fever, not like a cold
The beats are clear, the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music, 'cause first things first
First of all, get off the wall
It's time to party so have a ball
We slowed it on down, so get on up
Like a volcano I'll erupt
We got determination, bass and highs
I see real well because I've got four eyes
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
I do not sing, but I make a song
You'll live your whole life, and I hope you'll live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
It's Run-DMC, not Cheech and Chong
Strong as an ox, fresh out the box
The crowd is so loud, they're coming in flocks
And when we go on, the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock, there's nothing soft
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
We won't only rock the house, but we'll house the rock
We won't stroll, but we'll roll straight to the top
We're Run-DMC, and Jay makes three
The baddest B-Boys in history
When I'm recorded, you'll be rewarded
You know my song is great, 'cause you're all applauding
Not PCP or LSD, just DMC in the place to be
There's nothing free, you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a C.O.D.
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
The beat is slow in order to dance
We wanna hear I dos, and no I can'ts
First you move your legs, and then your arms
It's not fast and nervous, this dance is calm
It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo
Let it flow - let yourself go
Slow and low - that is the tempo

Two years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some emcee rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say,
The rhyme was Def and it went this way
Took a test to become an emcee
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac,
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone,
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we're talking autographs, years of laughs,
Champagne, caviar, and bubble baths
You see, that's the life that I lead, and
You sucker MC, this is who I be
So take that and move back, catch a heart attack
Because there's nothing in the world, that Run will ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a B-boy's stance,
And rock on the mike and make the girls want to dance
Fly like a dove, they come from up above,
I'm rockin on the mike and you can call me Run Love.
I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' girls just move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker emcee, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin all your life, you're cheatin on your wife
You're walkin round town like a hoodlum with a knife
You're hangin on the ave, chillin' with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
Ah with the one two three, three to two one
My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker emcee's, you sad face clown
You're a five-dollar boy and I'm a million dollar man
You're a sucker emcee, and you're my fan
You try to bite rhymes, all lines are mine
You're a sucker emcee in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest part of town,
Tryin to rap but you can't get down
You don't even know your English, your verbs or noun
You're just a sucker emcee you sad-faced clown
So DMC if you're ready, the people rockin' steady
You're drivin big cars, get your gas from Getty
[D.M.C.]
I'm DMC in the place to be, I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge,
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love to style
I'm the emcee you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? me myself and my microphone
All my rhymes are street delight
So here's another one for y'all to bite
When I rhyme I never quit,
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot to entertain,
And sucker emcee's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with a hip and a hop
You gotta let em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make a lot of sense,
You got to know when to start (when the beats commence...)

Always stayed fly, man I wished that you'd seen 'em
Said they had a scheme, but nobody believed 'em
No real job cause they stayed in the street
Gina did nails, Butter Love made beats
When they want to eat, they just walked in the store
They took what they wanted, man they the illest you saw
So one day they went uptown and seen em' with ice
Butter liked the chains and Gina said ""the rings are nice""
Next thing you know they want to pull off a heist
Shook, took a look, and shot the jeweler twice
Diamonds all shining as they flew in the air
Butter acting rough and grabbin' stuff by the pair
Gina had the door 'cause she good with the gun

Come on take the money and run, hey hey hey

Used to be a thug, now he's doing it clean
Ironic he was copping then they gave him the spot
Knew Butter back from Hollis - used to chill in the park
Seen Butter 'round the way with a brand new Benz
Gina looking pretty in the city with friends
Spudy said, ""Yo, I gotta get these ends,
And these are the two I gotta apprehend""
A B-Boy from Hollis promised not to tell
And lead these cops on a long, wrong trail
Spudy saw Gina and the chick turned pale
Runnin' saying something like she don't got bail

These are the words that I wrote so I hope that ya don't man
I'll never joke about the coke that you're smok-in
Understand you're fuckin up, fuckin up the block
Got shot rocked and that's just where the shit stops
..
What's the meaning of this? I must be dreaming
Everybody's got a beam in when I see men feigning
For a rhyme or rope, or a dime of coke
Sometimes I rhyme when I'm crying broke
Many many many records broke laws, broke jaws
A few months ago I had to ""Pause""
During that time, me and my man
Was chilling on the corner with a quart in our hands
A beef broke out, at Soul Kitchen spot
It was crazy Baby Pop, someone got shot
I seen him drop - then came the cops
Sayin, ""Nobody run - everybody stop""
I wanted to run, cause I was carryin my gun
Darryl Mack packin mine, strapped with my nine
Everyone on the wall, that's what the cop said
Everyone complied, except Bald Dread, he said,
""Blood claat boi me nah hafa deal wit dat
Yo I'm a superstar for de world dem call 'im Darryl Mack""
I turned around and said, ""Word up cop!""
He said, ""D.M.C., take your ass down the block""
If it happened to him, it could happen to you
Cause that's what's happenin on The Avenue
When I.. ""uhh, uhh uhh, uhh.. uhh..""
""Na-na-na-na-na! The Ave.""
[Run]
Now on The Ave. (what?) people steal and they dealin away
I got the feelin the illin will never ever pay
Cause on the street, you're never in the fast lane
You go to jail or get a bullet in your brain
People laugh and smile at a stick-up
A young man in a rut, shakin a big cup
People pass his ass and say, ""Tough luck""
To waste time for a dime is cold fucked up
A loud shot in the air - not rare
A brother fell to the ground, nobody cares
You ask why, the baby cry, a man laugh
Nobody give a damn, that's how they livin on The Ave.
... AUUUGH!
[D.M.C.]
Away from The Ave. they have what's called the backstreets
Another world of girls that crawl the backseats
Systems that are kickin, sinkin many black beats
(This and that goin on this and that street)
I remember the time there was a jam in ???
??, the music, no ?? til after dark
That's when the shit starts happening
(Brother from The Ave. this and that again)
Body move in the back and a quarter in the jar
Find the rules by the basketball court in the park
And the ? by the bench where the 40 dogs spark
The crowd crowds around like they found Noah's Ark
The young, hung, and swung on a swing
Glidin and slidin and ride the ding-a-ling
I didn't see a kid by the see, so he saw
(Near the monkey bars, funky cars we adore)
I'm throwin fate to the gate ?? ??
(And my man from Japan got vicked for sure)
Do me a favor when you roll with your crew
You gotta check out, check out, The Avenue

Pack the number one champion sound, Uh, is they ready?
[Run]
How y'all feel out there?
[DMC]
Ah yeah, alright, alright...
[Method Man]
Mr. Meth, Run-DMC, Jam-Master Jay, run!
[Cuts from ""Here we go"" and ""Together forever""]
1,2,3 In the place to be, as it is plain to see
He is DJ Run,
And we are the Krush Groovin, the body movin'
Party people your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out of your seats and lets get ill
That's right y'all...
[Run]
You're gettin' dollars, when dealing with Rev. Run
Look what I did done
And I come from Hollis, flipped it and scripted it and there it go
Wanna floss, Pull em off,  you know I headlinin'
Sell out tours, platinum plaque, wall to wall,
name ringin' out, from door to door
Still be the King, Run-DMC,
now y'all brothers wanna rhyme with me
Where's my house I've got the key
Brothers can't see me, not
All ya'll cats tryin to be me
Might as well go on, hits to me
Had a E, now drivin' a Beem
my girl ridin' around in Gucci
Rhyme so raw, I'm told like sushi
Gave some time to rhyme to Susan Lucci
Hoes coming out, saying ""Who's she?""
Dead by dawn, rhymin' for you D
[DMC]
Cracks in the cradle, cokes in the spoon
Little boy flew higher than the moon
Willie wanted weapons, Wilma wanted a wool
I come to school and lay down the rule
Johnny with the gun to break out of the crime
Shorty with the 40 was caught in the dark
Corner, black is a goner, didn't really want to go
Now mamma is a warner
[Method Man]
Now I walked on ice, and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
Judge a phenomena, deadly but calm world in my palm
Dead by dawn got the right to bear arms, bring me along
Another sound boy dying, hot iron
Stuff flyin, out the hardware appliance
Baby, Momma Crying'
Sobbin' and grievin', you was at odds,
With them kids, till they made it even
Let down your guard, yes you did
Now you barely breathin'
To win a whim, open season on a duck
We don't give a what
Yo, best, best to give it up
Joe and D, lets run these MCs, they phony
From Humphrey, they mad Bogey
Saddle up your horse, there's the sunset Mosey
Jam-Master Jay deserves a trophy for this track right,
Futuristic G past tight
If that's your girlfriend, she wasn't last night, punk
Little boy style's is mad chump, ain't no wins here
Sport is extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalties, Down with the King...!
[Run]
None of y'all really made money
Like DJ Run and came the run
And played the Garden like Jordan
You never done it so my brother think about it, come on
It's DJ Run and you the son
It's this style called run on
[Method Man]
Alright, now run on
[Run]
Never leave me open, so dopin' that I be scorin
cook is sleepin' or they snoring
so boring that I be touring
Lauren told ya that ya lost one
You can't afford this type of life
That it will cost Run
[Method Man]
Now speed it up, uh
[Run]
Run gonna make you wanna cry,
Make you wanna die,
Make you wanna lie, hold up
Got to come thru the rhyme
That run thru the mic, got a bounce to the ounce sure 'nuff,
not a player, hustler, hater or a buster only in Augusta Georgia
With a rap like a gun, that keeps a brother runnin
But it don't matter cause it will cost ya
Cause you're like a teacher, but I don't reach ya
Soundin like a preacher what?
Nobodys cuts faster than the Jam-Master
Why? 'cause he has to cut
My deal as a DJ, every time we play, put it on replay what?
Run rockin' up the heasy, gettin all greasy, down south with the bud
Run running like a rhino, spittin on vinyl
This is my final gun
Run breakin' that spinal, this is my title
Y'all get phucked with Run!
Run-DMC signing off...

Like a bum on the corner big boy in the car (car)
see the ki ki Kid Rock with the Bawitdaba
we hard as raw, what you saw is law
Once again my friend, it's Dj Run on tour
like Dj Run's his name and Kid Rock is his
He's DMC, it's like that, and that's the way it is
Beats get ya open my voice is just like a hurra..
Cain comin' vainin' and feignin' and rainin' terror
Those doing shows they knows I go over
Hoes even chose to pose, but get runover
I comes to see the three, and it's plenty
Jay's running DMC, that's what their puttin'
Never been a time like this that's so vital
I'm the King of Rock 'cause that's my title
Then take a count, 1, 2, 3...
Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay

You see, I want respect, and if I'm correct
Then you're all like a ball that I have checked
And the shots that they take have no effect
Some punk tried to dunk but he broke his neck
'Cause I rock harder, and I roll farther
You wanna battle Kid Rock, bitch don't bother
To waste your time, messin' with my rhyme
The only kick you'll get out of it is in your behind

Fire, flames, my name is worldwide
When we yes yes y'all, we rock it all night
To other emcees doin' rock n roll (roll)
It's Run-DMC, Kid Rock patrol
DJ Run 'til I'm done, DMC's the soul
Got MTV on yo' 'mote control (control)
Platinum, platinum can't mess with gold
We never let go of the mic's we hold
Our joints get played, cuts deluxe a la mode
DMC spittin' flames while your jams is cold
Over 30 million records worldwide we sold
Daryl Mac, JMJ, and my name is Joe
The other emcees know about the show
Hooked the turntables up to the telephone pole
Rock a rhyme 99 'til it's time to go
'Cause before long, DJ Run got a rhyme to flow
I come from a school that they call the old
DMC stands for Devasting Mic Control
I come from a school that they call the old
We never let go of the mic's we hold
I come from a school that they call the old
Over 30 million records worldwide we sold
I come from a school that they call the old

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH
I come from a school that they call the old
dum diddy dum diddy diddy dum dum

On the spot she was down for the bootknock
Drop top she was rockin the Tupac
Said: yo D, now me, what's you got
He says: 'She's a vibrant thing, vibrant thing, vibrant thing'

Seen a girl so crystal clean, I mean
Since I've been on the scene I've dreamed
Of girls in tube tops, pools on rooftops
Now this girl, who cruises the two pack
Get this girl in my bathtub, give her a backrub
My bathroom's like a nightclub
A few ladies in my den, fondlin'
A few ladies in the den so bring some Jello in
Any mighty fine fellow men like myself
To organize the panties on the shelves
Them girls, them girls
Them girls I do adore
I like em' sweet and fine, genuine, divine
All kinds I love them all
Them girls, them girls
Them girls around the way
Like a lemon to a lime
The women so fine sometimes they make me say:
[Run]
Had a fly girl cold called her honey
Mad that she spent up all my money
Fred went to bed with a girl from college, (what ?)
He told me she was looking for dollars
Gotta be the MC that don't get played
Girls gonna chase him, but they don't get paid
They might get naked, but they don't get laid
Assume these girls who made first grade
[Fred]
I like the small girls, I like the tall girls
I like all the girls, f*cking dirty call girls
So Run, let's bring them girls in
And their girlfriends, but no one let the squirrels in
As for the boyfriends, they'll find joy
When the girlfriends come home and bring Limp Bizkit toys in
I like to break shit when I'm in a snake pit
But no silicone cause' I don't like the fake chit
Them girls, them girls
Them girls I do adore
I like em' sweet and fine, genuine, divine
All kinds I love them all

Yo, yo girls get live
Girls galore, girls I've never even seen before
The way they sway, that makes me smile
And Run get a dime on the top of the pile

Girls are freaking things are good
Girls can fill up my neighborhood
But don't take my sunshine I'll be OK
As long as these girlies are here to stay
Them girls, them girls
Them girls I do adore
I like em' sweet and fine, genuine, divine
All kinds I love them all

Ayo man, can we see them mics man?
[Run]
One two, one two, and I say...
[D.M.C.]
Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled
Get out your seats and let's get ill
That's right y'all, we're not just rough, we're more than tough
And when it comes to rhymes, we got enough
[Run]
It's like that y'all, and we don't stop the body rock
Now it's together (forever) forever (together)
Run-D.M.C. and we're tougher than leather
We're making and breaking and snatching and taking
The deal's for real we could never be faking
[D.M.C.]
I'm chilling, he's cooling, I'm a king that's ruling
Preach and teach and always schooling
[Run]
See, we're learning, and earning, the tables keep turning
To be like us, you could cold be yearning
Pulsating dominating up above
Cold chilling and I'm willing, the name's Run-Love
[D.M.C.]
Creating devastating in the place to be
Full of soul and mic control because it's easy to ""D""
[Run]
Beat making, never faking, chilling all of the time
For playing rhyme saying, I get mine
[D.M.C.]
No way to rock me, no way to stop me
It's seems quite shocking to those that mock me
And that's not all, MC's have the gall
To pray and plan for my downfall
But I'm not running, I'm just stunning
Smart not stupid cause I'm so cunning
MC's regret it, I'm upsetting
My recitals take titles and titles I'm betting
[Run]
Like that y'all, so just keep above
See my name is DJ Run, they call me Run-Love
Creative creator, creating the rhyme
Devastating devastator not doing a crime
Making beats every day, and I get mine
The biggest star going far, so check the shine
Big winner, not a sinner when I do my thing
I might have a sling or a fling cause I'm down with the king
Biggest rap no crap, I do not sing
You want a show, let me know, just give me your ring
Like that y'all, we're just keeping it on
D.M.C. my man, to the break of dawn rock
[D.M.C.]
I'm ill, I chill, with skill I kill
And none of my rhymes are run of the mill
I cause grief, I'm chief, there is no beef
And if there's beef I knock out teeth
MC's act dumb, they know where I'm from
The King from Queens and I'm down with Run
[Run]
I take a stand my man, and I won't sit
Cause I'm the real deal, like Coke is it
Then you won't find my name in the yellow page
Cause Run only speaks when it's on the stage
I got a rhyme in line that's easy to find
With a sketch so check, so one of a kind
Got two MC's and one DJ
Grab at least 20 G's when we play
So D.M.C. my boy, my mellow my man
So get on the mic and won't you take the stand
[D.M.C.]
My rock is hard, you can't pull my card
I'm a shining star, shining near and far
Shining like the sun on a day of fun
Always on the move cause I'm down with Run
I'm the cool and calm, I'm the calm and cool
I'm not a fool, I went to school
My name is D.M.C. I tell no lie
And I graduated from Cooley High
I am the only rapper who will not die
I'm a greusome guy, and you can try
To battle D.M.C. but you must be high

Grammar like a hammer information recieveable
Sent by the lord, here and abroad
With words that were thought they could retort
For force because that makes Run the boss
So get lost, becuase I just tossed the poss
Make way today, and if I may, I say
I make pay with Jay, so get away OK?
Gaining weight, I ate the whole plate to date
Never make the break, I don't state the stake
Just keep the keep, don't sleep for weeks
Get peeps to leap, and I'll bleep the jeep
Put down the clown, get 'round the town
I've bound the sound, and I've found the crown
Get paid and laid, not jade afraid
'Cause I stayed and made, not a man to fade
Gotta group the troop, gotta shoot to shoot
Shoot hoop to scoop, or a scoop to loop
Going off and on, not soft to con
Just black and back to go back and run
Go to school and cool, not drool or pool
Gotta soul and goal and cold and old jewel
Upset the best, I met, met a jest
Just lest the pest, and I am the best
Gotta punch the crunch, cold munch the munch
Not Grady or the lady from the Brady Bunch
Got Gs and Lees, like Ds and Ts
Charge Bs for freeze, or Ds with ease
No dope to cope, just good to go
There's hope the Pope, big nope for nope
Quite clever and ever, but together forever
Run-DMC, and we're tougher than leather
Strong and mighty, hard as can be
Perception of the life were as strong as D
Every Friday I'm writing, write for what's right
It's even deeper in the night, I'm keepin with my mic
I gotta go for broke, and I ain't no joke
I'm gonna yoke the choke, 'cause of the suckers I smoke
Rush and crush, leave 'em in the dust
Bust the bust, those scum who mess with us
Only strong survive, and the weak will die
As long as I'm alive, I'll keep my head up high
'Cause we're strong in body, and smart in mind
I was born to bind, as the gift to mankind
I pump with jump, never givin no slack
I be killin' the villain, and I chillin' (you're black)
I'm not a bum, I'm not dumb, it's me you work from
I'm the king to my beat 'til my kingdom come
'Cause I'm rough and tough, call huff and puff
Don't bluff the stuff, got enough to muff
Don't long it on, go long on song
Go on and on, just the best be done
Put preach and teach, with a speech to reach
All streets in each, with beats for treats
Got the king supreme, may seem the gleam
With a beam the ream, no screen was seen
Not a gang to bang, or to hang with slang
Talkin angers ang, about everything
Just brothers and others, like fathers and mothers
Who discovered the lovers that think they're up and above us
No crime or time, just rhyme and lines
For roaming on no phone in time
Just cut the stuff, do you get enough?
'Cause we're rougher than tougher and rougher-tougher than tough
With a voice like thunder, words of wonder
All alone standing tall, and suckers roll under
Possessed with power, cowards will cower
Dogs we devour, hour after hour after hour
Three men riot, you can't deny it
Will so ill, that you can't defy it
Gonna live, positive, forever and ever
Run-DMC, and we're tougher than leather

It was the vision of a world working as a team
It was a dream [get up]
Just a dream [wake up], [wake up], [get up]
There were no guns, no what
No tanks, no what, atomic bombs
And to be frank homeboy there were no arms

Just a dream [get up], [wake up], [wake up]
Between all countries there were good releations
There finally was a meeting to unite the nations
And everybody had an occupation
'cause we all worked together to fight starvation
It was a dream [wake up]

Everyone was treated on an equal basis

And the people all chilled and celebrated

There were no street people, we live rent free
And every single person had a place to be
A job, a home, and the perfect pay
And the world was free of greed and hate

Just a dream [get up], [wake up], [wake up]
Unemployment was at a record low
And the presidents were chillin at our show
Listening to the things that we had to say
And trying to create a new and brighter day

That's a real big pleaser
Of times I can reminisce

With the boys in tune
And her feet just fly up in the air
Singin hey diddle diddle with a kitty in the middle
And they swingin like it just don't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play

Little skirt hangin way up her knee

In the school gym locker
And they find they were lookin at D

Never made it with a lady
Til the boys told me somethin I missed

Had a daughter had a favor

Ah to the maximum, and keep askin 'um
when the city gonna fix where the BLACKS are from
And every day around the way another one got
bucked in his head - from a gunshot
No chance in advance for the ambulance
Cause he was just another victim of the circumstance
A brother died, the mother cried, it was a pity
But that's how it goes down when you're livin in the city

1990, and this is what's goin on
To the break of dawn
24/7, Run-D.M.C. in effect
That's ??
All those weak-rhymin, rewindin MC's
[Run] That means you pause
[both] My word is born
[Run]
Yeah, speakin on truth
From the old school on down to the youth
Since the days, that I was the age of
""three""; stop - listen to me
This is how it used to be - ""go!""
Stand on another line, why?
You did a crime now the time is mine
I school you and your crew, why?
Youse is my brother
Stop - sellin and killin one another
Take some time, to see what's missin
Brothers in the ?, we on a mission
Thinkin back from the sale you made
And back home, a grave is what your brother paid
His life, because of a system
Now you think you're down, you cold dissed him
Shut up, cause I'm fed up, with this culture
And flyin high in the sky, a big vulture
Waitin and debatin, to see who's next
For ""brothers and sisters"" of the opposite sex
So hold on, keep it intact
And go on, flow on, positive black
B-boys be black be proud, right on
""You know we're bout to"" be black
And my word is born
My word is born
My word is born
My word is born
[D.M.C.]
Let's, let's..
Let's begin to talk truth - it seems
That y'all make a big out of things that are small
We all play the same game for fame to claim
?? bright lights and write your name
They'll soup you up, til you think you're large
Got a spot on tour, but I'm still in charge
A big nigga's hittin it, don't renege
Bust a rap like a cap like a snap of twig
That extends from the hands of a branch on a tree
Like you new jack rappers, run from me
I got proof of truth, I cut and go raw
(Word em up D!) My word is born
[Cuts by Jay and samples to the last ten seconds]
[D.M.C.]
1990's
And ain't nuttin changed, PUNK!

(One) day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side to side
He asked this old lady, ""Yo, yo, um...is this Kentucky Fried?""
The lady said ""Yeah"", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fries, Big Mac!
You be illin'
(To)day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat (It's free!) no pay
Radio in hand, snacks by feet
Gig's about to start, you Shootin'' popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream ""Touchdown!""
You be illin'
The other day around the way I seen you illin' at a party
Drunk as skunk you illin' punk and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said
""Yo, yo, can I get this dance?""
She smelt your breath and then
She left you standin' in your illin' stance
You be illin'
Dinner, you ate it, there is none left
It was salty, with butter and it was def
You proceeded to eat it cause you was in the mood
But holmes you did not read it was a can of dog food!

You must be outta your mind
what do ya think you're doin' here
20 years gone by, and you still don't know why
when there was a day one, there was a DJ Run
and when you think of days way back, there was a Daryl Mac
and before you had a ghetto blaster,
there really was a Jam Master
kid kracker, that's me, yo Kid Rock,
come show the unknown what you think is what
(Kid Rock)
What chyall do is just in a legend
been rhymin' since the age of eleven
I know the records so I'm goin' to heaven
seven and I'm rollin eleven
beats platinum popper your copper
you rock a Benz but I got a chopper
sayin' this thing over and over
you think I'm playin, but I'm not so I'll say it again
I'm say only you know what I'm sayin'
playin' what you think I'm playin'
rollie while my hommie is Joey
the problem is y'all think that you know me
never have I ever been better
mad cause I'm tougher than leather
sunny on the story is whether you know what I'm sayin
I'm the king and I'm rulin' forever
(Kracker)
Yeah, you better believe Hip-hop and rock does exist
and before you cross that off the list,
you better get yourself some of this
and you can wish til your eyes bleed
but you know what I mean
and this stuff aint never been so mean
so you better come clean before you can't come at all
cuz once you start to spit
you can bet your ass you're gonna fall
I said you can bet your ass you're gonna fall (why why why why)
(Kid Rock)
why the hell yall rappers be frontin'
don't publish shit that points to you know nothin
that rollie must be borrowed or somethin'
and when I roll up like this I been huntin'
feedin' up a bunch for a million

Run's up in your Bodega
Queen's, and
to the playa's in
all your hustlers in Memphis
livin' up in tenament buildings
(Kracker)
Uh huh and we all say none
and there'll be no more
from shore to shore
coast to coast

You talk too much...
You talk too much...
You talk too much...
You talk too much...
Hey! You over there, I know about your kind
You're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9
Everywhere that you go, no matter where you at
I said you talk about this, and you talk about that
When the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back
Your mouth is so big, one bite could kill a Big Mac
You talk too much You never shut up
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never shut up
You talk about people, you don't even know
And you talk about places, you NEVER go
You talk about your girl, from head to toe
I said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow
You talk too much You never shut up!!
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never shut up
You're the instigator, the orator of the town
You're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown
You talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep
Has anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap
You talk too much You never shut up!!
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!
Talking is the one thing, that you can do best
You told the cavity creeps, to watch out for Crest
You never have the story, right and exact
And then you always try to bore me, with your yakkity yak
You talk too much And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!
Everyday you are out fighting someone in the street
And you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat
Then you wonder how, you got in this mess
Just think of what you said, then take a guess
You talk too much. You never shut up
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!
You're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good
You're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood
The Barbara Walters, and the Howard Cosell
You always come around, with a story to tell
You talk too much And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!
I said it's everybody's business that you love to mind
And talkin to you, is like dropping a dime
You're spreading the word, like it is your job
You should be a stool pigeon, who works for the mob
You talk too much And you never shut up
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never shut up!
A big blabbermouth, that's what you are
If you were a talk show host, you'd be a star
I said your mouth is big, size extra large
And when you open it, it's like my garage
You talk too much And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never shut up
You always like to gossip, just like a girl
You talk so damn much, it's outta this world
When you're reincarnated, in your second life
You won't be a man, you'll be a nagging wife
You talk too much Then you never shut up
He said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!
SHUT UP!!!
SHUT UP!!!
Twenty-five hours, eight days a week
Thirteen months of the year, is when you speak
I'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk
Why don't you find a short pier, and take a long walk
You talk too much Then you never shut up!
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!
You talk too much You should be out of breath
You talk too much Man you naggin' me to death
You talk too much Tired of hearing you speak
You talk too much Eight days a week
You talk too much Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much, Why don't you ever SHUT UP!!!
You talk too much Then you never shut up!
I said you talk too much, Homeboy you never SHUT UP!!!

All polluted and often invaded
With troubled heart and weakened mind
Livin their lives and hopin to find
The golden key to prosperity
Never have a grip on reality
This makes day-to-day living hard
Jump in your fate, never keeping the card
You're just going through life without a trace
When the answers you seek are in front of your face
You're blind
You're blind
Tell 'em D
You're headed for the top or so you think
But that's not true for you, your life's on the brink
Of self-destruction, total corruption
You better get out or die from consumption
Sweatin' for a dollar to get nothin back
Cause at the end of the week, you still get taxed
You'd even sell your soul to make your life correct
But with the rate of inflation, you should eat your check
So you try to make a hustle to get ahead
But the only thing you manage is to stay in the red
Concrete-front job to sell to wrecks
And your Jones for success puts your life in check
You're blind
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind
So you think the facts mean you can't win
So you devote your time to a life of sin
Hanging out late is how you survive
Making deals, talking jive and telling lies
Pressure beatin ya down, like you're not handlin
And all the while, your mind is ramblin
About being fly, or even sly
And being held low in the public eye
You desire these things, but you don't know why
You're standing on the corner cold, playing the post
Cause another sucker said ""You were chillin the most""
You're blind
You're blind, Yo you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind
You're blind
You run, rap, talk about what you hate
Livin your life just to perpetrate
You thinkin style in chill, because you're always cold
With your platform shoes and your stained gold
So you think you're bad, sheer dynamite
But if you only knew the crew, cause you're freaks delight
Wearing the tightest jeans, and shortest skirt
You think you're cold chillin, lookin like a jerk
No matter what you do, come out second rate
Thinkin' you're on time, but you're already late
You're blind
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind
The moral to the story may not be clear
And the only way to catch it is to lend an ear
Stop frontin so hard, why don't you peep your car
And your goals in life may not be far
Because these words I say are meant for you to hear
So if you bust these facts you will persevere
You're blind
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC
You're blind
You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC

You're blind, And you can't see
You need to wear some glasses like DMC

HAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM..
Get it all baby ..
Get it all baby ..
Get it all baby ..
""what you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it ..
Suck this dick for daddy
She swallowed it ..
Usin' that lips
She swallowed it ..
It's the world's biggest dick
""what do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
Slow is the tempo
Now talkin' but an info
So peep it up here goes the info
This is the bitches and the ho's crew
She get it as much we make bets on who's the ho's we'd love to go through
And for the dick that she does give her a drum role
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And a list of videotaper
And if you got a gang of niggaz, the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nutz
And they even take de broomstick at the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take"" She ax's
""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shake""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very Irresistable
I could'nt pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho' was doin' some ole' crazy dick
That made me start havin' a fit'
Cuz the bitch sucks de hellified dick .. [suck this dick]
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!
Now one night night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggaz straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no
Five niggaz in the back it was de neighborhood ho'
Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windowz are all foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit' cuz de bitch that I'm with
Sayz no dickin' on the 1st date dick
Now I'm like - Damn! I wish I was in the bucket
To be with 6 niggaz with the ho' and I can dick it
So I told de ho' I was with that I'm goin' to de snack bar -
And got de dick out de car.
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggaz that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I could'nt see a face, all I saw was de pussy and the chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt the order
Peep over the seat - OH dick! it's the preacher's daughter!
And she's only 14 and a ho'
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But was it passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' backtide
I told the bitch to do it quick:
""You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!""
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!
Now I'm a break it down with a fact -
Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they could'nt quit
Cuz not even bustin' the bitches today they love the dick
And those are the main one's that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knowz the bitches are used to it
So fellows, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick punch the bitch in the eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth -
Put your dick in and move the dick around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on de raw
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck a meet off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nutt out of a dick just like dreino
Get the last drop, unclog in de back
Then the stupid bitch is at that with the same dick de next night
Because she just can't quit
Cuz she's addicted, addicted, addicted, addicted
She's addicted, addicted, she's addicted to suck a good dick
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it

Once again beatin' on your mothafuckin' ear drumbs
Doin' much damage for all you slutty ass ho's
Yo, there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was gettin' G oh for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was garunteed to give a Muthafucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest she was a hooker
So I took her - a 100 yards, to the blvd
I told her ""I'll take care o' you, you take care o' me""
You've gott a P I M P and all I want is the money
She went to work and the nigguz were fiendin' yo
She had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like medusa
Her tities fully grown
A look and your dick turns to stone yeah
Keepin' on mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy
Fuckin' with dre should be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho' but what do you know
The bitch tried to gag me
So - I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed
I was thinking the worst but yo I had to let my niggaz fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the 44 yo
Then I straight smoked the ho'
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
I was soft and she thank me
Coughed to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outa here and that's how it turns out
Now Vikky Vikky Vikky, she's very tricky
She put her hicky on top of my dick
Sick betsy - she told me she loved me
And she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick with me
I said I wanted but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this - she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo She wrote a cheque name me a cheque
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vikky concerned me
Her husband was the District Auterny
So, before he found out he was crossed up
'Bout his bitch I was fuckin' I had to tossed her
And put you slick - some nigga never forget
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outa here and that's how it turned out
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
[Muthafuckin' right!]
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I had to excecute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a still trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga
I think I had a flashback though
'Cause I said ""fuck it""
Loped and Choked and Smoked to the ho' like this :
""bitch, it's all about Dre
The money money money and this all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me
And remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
'Cause niggaz knew that she was someone
A little later though she called 1
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done?
So what?
One less bitch you gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out..
Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the Muthafuckin' trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with sea net shoes
I knew my money was commin' up sho'
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get cought
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with the other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like the motha ho's
I told the 2 Muthafuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a 9 so they could'nt refuse
I shot the nigga he was outa there
And tied the bitch to the Muthafuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
[.... MIX with Easy E sayin':]
In reality -
A fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches,
And all bitches are created equal.
To me - all bitches are the same :
Money hungry scandlist groopy ho's that's always riding on a nigga's
dick.
Always in a nigga's pocket and when the nigga runs out of money
The bitch is gone in the wind.
To me :
ALL BITCHES AIN'T shit!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

""We haven't spotted them yet.""
""But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity.""

A 100 Miles and Runnin'.
MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck.
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers.
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers.
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past.
Point blank - They can kizz my black azz.
I didn't stutter when I said ""fuck Tha Police"".
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace.
Now it's broken and can't be fixed.
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall.
Runnin' like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all.

Hold it in the air.
'Cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'...
""Into this news. Four fugitives are on the run.""
""FBI sources tell us that the four are headed""
""100 miles to their homebase, Compton.""
[Eazy E]
Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear.
So I can tell you why...
[Dr. Dre]
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon.
Runnin' on but never runnin' out.
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out.
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do.
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude.
Confused...
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose.
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds.
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes.
And Dre is back from the C-P-T.
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees.
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass.
'Cause I'm a nigga known for havin' a notorious past.
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick.
Now the FBI's all over my dick.
[Eazy E]
Got us tick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock.
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block.
A 100 Miles from home and ,yo, it's a long stretch.
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch.
Yeah, back to Compton again.
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen.
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time.
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind.
Runnin' like I just don't care.
Compton's 50 miles but , yo, I'mma get there.
Archin' my back and on a straight rough.
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out.
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by.
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass.
A 100 Miles and Runnin'...
[Interlude: ]
This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton.
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
""Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide.""
Good luck brothers.
[MC Ren]
Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose.
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused.
I know it was a set-up.
So now I'm gonna get up.
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up.
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong.
They got everybody singin' my ""fuck Tha Police"" song.
And while they treat my group like dirt,
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts.
So I'mma run til I can't run no more.
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score.
I got a urge to kick down doors.
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls.
[Dr. Dre]
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'.
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'.
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it.
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it.
The number's even - now I'm leavin'.
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in.
Her and the troops are right behind me.
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me.
[Eazy E]
One more mile to go through the dark streets.
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet.
But you know I never stumble or lag last.
I'm almost home so I better haul ass.
Tearin' up everything in sight.
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight.
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 Miles of Runnin'!
[Outro:]
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

Well it's because motherfuckers want to blast me
And run me outa my neighborhood
They label me as a dope dealer
Yo! And say that I'm no good
But I can't find jobs so niggers wouldn't have to go out
Gave up some dope on the corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A fifteen year old black kid will go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest
Why do I call myself a nigger, you ask me?
I guess it's the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin a job was murder
fuck flippin burgers
'Cause a deserve a nine-to-five I can be proud of
That I can speak loud of
And to help a nigger get out of.
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin paid like a mother fucker
A young brother who don't give a fuck about another
Why do I call myself a nigger, you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get faced down in the street
They throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President
Why do I call myself a nigger, you ask me?
Because my mouth is so mother fuckin nasty
bitch this, bitch that
Nigger this, nigger that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin fat
Gettin paid to say this shit here
Makin more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So, why not call myself a nigger?
It's better than pulling the trigger and goin up the river
And don't I get called a nigger anyway?
Booked as a motherfucker and locked away
So... so, cut out all that bull shit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life
(Niggers, crack-heads, thieves.
If there's a hell below, we're all gonna go.)
Nigger. Nigger. Nigger
Nigger. Nigger
Nigger, please
I'm treated like a fuckin disease.
You say: why can I call myself a nigger so quick?
Cause I can reach in my draws and pull out a bigger dick
Yo! niggers say nigger we cool
But, cracker say nigger not to fuck up
But I got to be a fast nigger
Not to be the last nigger
Or I have to beat your ass, nigger
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later
In a verse I curse
Because I [?] with this to keep my shit straight bumpin'
Murder created by the streets of Compton
I get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it
Because I know it
And if you think I'm fucking your wife
Your mother fuckin' right
Yo! Because I'm a nigger for Life
Nigger, this
Nigger, that
The actual fact is that I'm black
And bound to attract
The attention of another
I mean the other
But I'm a mother fucker that'll have them running for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothing
Except getting paid, getting bitches, and [?] with stitches
Which is all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say
The nigger's here to stay
But what about the fake niggers, the house niggers
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But NWA is outta your mother fuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a mother fuckin' thing
I call myself a nigger 'cause my skin won't whiten
I call myself a nigger 'cause the shit that I'm writing
Hypes me, hypes other mother fuckers around me
And that's the reason why they want to surround me
And ask me: why do I call myself a nigger-o
Ain't none of their fuckin' business 'cause I'll let the trigger go
So get out of my presence, and get out of my sight
'Cause MC Ren is a nigger for Life
You're a nigger 'til you die
If you're a poor nigger, then you're a poor nigger
If you're a rich nigger, you're a rich nigger
But you never stop being a nigger
And if you get to be educated, you's an education nigger
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigger for Life

[Bitch:] You like that?
[Homeboy:] Put 'em off
[Bitch:] It's good?
[Homeboy:] Ouch, shit, godamn bitch you bit' my damn, shit I said suck the mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!
[Narrator:] Has this ever happend to you?
Does her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?
Does she know how to suck a dick?
Well, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and buy
NWA's new book entitled ""The art of sucking dick"".
[Bitch:] Lesson 1 - First you grab the dick, next you gently lick it up
and down, then insert it into the mouth. Take it slow, don't rush
it, and before you know it ..
SPLASH!
[Eazy E:]
It goes one for the treble, two for the bass, She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it ...
Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow
As I produce and illustrate you to a ho'
Cought on the late night, Stampin' on the base-pipe
She's a hype to get you on the late flight
But back in school she was a cutie, yo
Then after graduation started givin' up the booty
In school, stuck her head in a feather
Every time I asked her what's the time
It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'
I wanted a date, she would'nt even be my friend
But now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me
Cuz she's got a gang o' kidz knuckle-heads and all dirty
And she's givin' pimp by a nigga that's 30
I saw her hangin' in the alley
Raggin' to her friends how she's ho'in' in de valley
All by herself, doin' on the whole strole
Commin' back home late night with the bankrob
You know a bitch like that makes me sick,
But I've heard that she sucks a good dick
[Chorus:]
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]
At a high school dance -
Me and the niggaz bailed in
I saw her sittin' with her friends, With the clan,
So sexy, thought she was all that
She would'nt even look it up because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doorz
On the streets she's a late night feature
Walkin' home from school saw her suckin' a nigga'z dick, another bleacher
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut could'nt escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw her
There was'nt a nigga on the block
Late at night not gettin' done
So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course cuz my dick you it's harder than a telepole
Then again it don't concern me
Cuz there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot de ho'
I mean checkin' with de quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from gettin' sick -
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick
[Chorus:]
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]
Now I was at a club on a late late sunday
Peepin' at the bitches 'till the next day monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch who lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I locked her
She was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up
Back at the house she was bitch n' be ignorin'
And when she start to talk the ho' was kinda borin'
Yo, but now I got to dawn, see
Now she's dancin' on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shakin' that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans -
Just while I'm a take her to a room
But yo I mean a rest room
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grabbed her hand and she's with it
Oh and when she turned sobber should'nt have had admit it
So while she's dropped I'd better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick ..
[Chorus:]
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
Lick de big dick, baby, I wanna fuck this one
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it
""So there you have it - a job well done, but for now let me get back to what
I was doing""
She swallowed it .. She swallowed it ..
Get it all baby, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy
Suck this diiiiiick
Oh, she swallowed it .. get it all, suck this dick for daddy ..
Hey mothafuck, I want you to suck Dre's dick,
Then I want you to suck Yella dick
You already sucked Ren's dick ..
YOU BOYZ ARE DISGUSTING!
Just suck my dick bitch

""We haven't spotted them yet.""
""But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity.""
[MC Ren]
A 100 Miles and Runnin'.
MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in.
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck.
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I freeze with my hands on a hot hood.
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who.
When in a black and white the capacity is two.
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers.
Now wearin' my dyes, 'cause I'm not stupid, mutherfuckers.
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past.
Point blank - They can kizz my black azz.
I didn't stutter when I said ""fuck Tha Police"".
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace.
Now it's broken and can't be fixed.
'Cause police and little black niggers don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall.
Runnin' like a team. Well, see, I might have slayed y'all.
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air.
'Cause MC Ren has a 100 Miles of Runnin'...

Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase.
With a steady pace on the face that just we raced.
The road ahead goes on and on.
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon.
Runnin' on but never runnin' out.
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out.
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do.
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude.
Confused...
Yo, but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose.
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds.
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes.
And Dre is back from the C-P-T.
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E.
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!

Nickname eazy-e your 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking, to show my shit
Rap a hole in my dick, boy, I don't quit
Crowd rocking motherfucker from around the way
I got a six shooter yo I'm mean and brave
Rolling through the hood to find the boys
Kick dust and cuss crank up some noise
Police on my drawers, I have to pause
40 ounce in my lap and it's freezing my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
And I say to myself, they can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the 8 in my lips
Put in the old tape marvin gaye's greatest hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the east side south of compton
See a big ass and I say word
I took a look at the face, and the bitch was to the curb
Hoes on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-e's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Riding on slauson down towards crenshaw
Turned down the sound to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and had a fit
Cause a mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tip cause I was drunk
See a sissy ass punk had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigger what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of dodge
Sucka on me cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-e's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Olde english 800 cause that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, 40, quart, or can
Drink it like a madman yes I do
Fuck the police and a 502
Stepped in the park I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said, eric your breath smells!
40 ounce in hand that's what I got
Yo man you see eazy hurlin' in the parking lot?
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your hoe
Asked her to dance and she said, hell no!
Called her a bitch cause that's the rule
Boyz n tha hood trying to keep me cool
Tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get on up
I start dodging the dogs and watch you fall
Just dumb full of cumn got knocked out cold
Make you look sick you snotty nosed prick!
Now your fly bitches all over his dick!
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-e's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling
Pass the brew mother fucker while I tear shit up
And you all listen up close to roll call
Eazy-e's in the place I got money and juice
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so goddamn funky
Do the olde 8 fuck the brass monkey
Ice cube writes the rhymes, that I say
Hail to the niggas from cia

We make hard core jams so fuck respect
Make a toast all you punks to the title I'm holding

Early in the morning hop into the B-enz

Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To skoop up Ren I heard shots -
1 2 3, Then I see the nigga
Hop in de Benz and it was Ren on the mothafuckin' trigger
He got in the Benz and said

Real niggaz got a hat-top breakin'
I hooked up with 3 more niggaz and started makin' -

Murder I heard her when she screamed the ""Drop!""
Cuz it's on part of slung
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I ride to the rythem of a pop
Remember the first nigga that runs is the first to get shot
Whoever thinks that what I say and betray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack de fact
And take that shit back cuz they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggaz they're tryin' to calm
If mothafuckaz could get it, nobody would've fuck with it
Appetite for destruction -
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit -
Murder in the first degree - a man slaughter
Takin' a life of his wife and young doughter
A whole city of bitches they look sucked up
And the niggaz iz killin' it's straight fucked up
Whoever sayin' what I'm sayin'z for greed
The 9 even when they're tryin' to feed my appetite for destruction
"" .. you gotta know I'm talkin' to .. ""
The Appetite is tremendous
So I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they ax me to end this
Some trouble that I cought cuz I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because I'm de kamikazi
He took de swing from my hand - thought I was faded
Start runnin' for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the 9 went BANG [shot]
And all over the wall was his mothafuckin' brain
Cuz I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm, cuz I'm hittin' like a mothafuckin' bomb
I do damage with the 9 in my hand
But the average nigga they do not mean to understand
I'm from the streets so therefor
You know I don't care for
A sucker that ain't down with the real niggaz the niggaz the niggaz yo
And after when the shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the 9 wanna leave
I got a .38 hittin' down the sleeve
And it's ready to go to work cuz that's what it's here for
I shoot down a milion niggaz and shoot one more
And that's the milion and one
They could'nt hang with the appetite
Cuz they was'nt rappin' right
So I had to destroy whoever was standin' in my presence
For fuckin' up de asses appetite for destruction
""Cops would'nt hurt you, on your ass, man, you know, they realy degrade you,
I suppose you don't believe that shit, don't believe in cops degrade you,
Oh come on, those biddin'z, those people was resistin' arrest""
Check it out yo, in de house yo
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you somethin' -
I possess to 10 commendmendts of the Hip Hop Baxter,
Known as the thief and murderer :
First one -
I'm a be a nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respected, break your mothafuckin' neck
Second one -
Allwayz gotta fuck at a wedlock
I like it when the pussy goes snack crack and pop
Number three -
I'm a gangsta, an addict
I smoke any foolz tryin' to cause some statix
Number four -
Here's what's these are
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hard core
Fifth one -
My kill has just begun
I pull out my gun that will keep me on the run
Step six -
Hmmm, it's kinda tricky -
Can't forget that I'm mothafuckin' chickenshit
To the ones who tries to play the E -
By the time you reach Seven you'll be 6 feet deep
Number eight -
Make no mistake,
Move real slicky and you're bound to catch yo' pray
Ninth one -
I gotta be raw, fuck any brain once your man made law
Last but not least, I must be real -
Number ten - is my appetite to ki ...

What you want is an unexpected approach,
That may delay a suspects awareness of your presence,
Until you have a chance to assist the situation you are confronted.
Approach to danger, don't move;
It's hard to predict what will happen next.
(Oh shit, he has a gun!) drop the gun
You could've prevented a tragedy.
[Ren:]
You can approach, but the danger-light is blinking,
A self-desctruct button is activated when I'm thinking.
This is a tribulation, the weakened judge,
The prophecy was fulfilled cause I never budge.
I took up the tools, crucifixion was the extreme,
They're seeing doubles of me, but it wasn't a dream.
One vision was of life, the other was death,
Then I didn't give a fuck if death took your last breath.
So you burn in my pit that I call hell,
Where you got send because your shit don't sell.
My twenty-twenty was blurry from the smoke,
Of the niggaz that I burned and tormented but I didn't choke.
I started doing 'em, I kept on doing 'em,
Do 'em for shoot 'em up till that nigga Ren was booing 'em.
And my presence to the suckers was of a stranger,
But fuck it, they can approach to the danger.
[Eazy:]
If you can be seen, you can be hit.
If you can be hit, you can be killed.
(He's on the line! Shoot him!)
[Dre:]
Fatal approach to danger, just to remain a strangeler,
Outrun, the shot of a gun with a ganger.
Murder in the first degree, but it's worse to be,
A dead motherfucker or a nigga in custody.
With everybody thinking of death I kept working,
To be one of the last niggaz left.
So many people looking for hope, they're broke,
Without checking the fingerprints on the motherfuckers' throat.
A heart of steal can reveil the real nigga in me,
So figuring to see the D-E-A-D
Bodies like a nigga's straight walking in a cemetary,
So it's very necesarry to carry ammunition for niggaz wishing,
But they better take caution, before Dre goes off,
And starts killing motherfuckers,
Just in order to change the anger for the real nigga,
When I approach to danger
Approach the motherfucking danger,
Come back to hell and send me some time... (this is it y'all)
[Eazy:]
Final approach to danger, death, destruction around every corner,
Another dead body and you wanna keep running.
But even the rain turns black,
All you can do is stay alert to try to say out of the search-light.
No prison, nobody makes bail,
Everybody gotta go but see, it ain't no jail.
Think about death, taking your last breath,
Heart beating like a motherfucker like there ain't no time left.
For so many ways to stay up, I gotta get mine,
Even though they wanna make a crime.
Yo, I'm being real, a better or latter in the beginning,
Because it will release the fucking police.
Fuck 'em, I approach to danger,
Cause I don't give a fuck if somebody gotta get fucked up.
So you might as well kiss your ass goodbye,
Cause in the long run... (we'll all die)

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
Dope man please can I have another hit
The dope man said cluck I don't give a shit
If your girl kneels down and sucks my dick
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her
Nigga livin in cash selling to smokers
That's the way goes that's the name of the game
Young brotha gettin over by slangin cane
Gold around his neck 14 k he has it
Bitches on his dick 24-7 plus he's makin
Money keepin tha base heads waiting
Rollin 6.4. wit tha fresh ass daytons
Livin in compton, cailfona ca
His uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid
Nigga begging for credit he's knockin out teeth
Clockin much dollars on tha 1st and 15th
Big wad of money nuttin less than a twenty
Yo you want a five-oh the dope man gots plenty
To be a dope man boy you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a kid to a g it's all about money
10 peace base pipe comes free
If people out there are not hip 2 tha fact
If you see some one gettin money 4 crack he's
Tha.......

Dope man dope man

You need a nigga wit money so u get a dope man
Juice that fool 4 has much as u can
She likes his car and he gets wit her
Got a black eye cuz tha dope man hit her
Let that slide and u pay it no mind
Find he's slapping u all tha time
That's ok cuz he'z rich and u ain't
Nuttin but tha dope man'z bitch do what he say and
U keep yo mouth shut popin that trash
Might get you fucked up you'll sit and cry
If tha dope man strikes you he don't give a fuck
He gots 2 just like you
There's a another girl in tha dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
Shes called strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry strawberry iz tha neighborhood hoe
Do any thing for a hit are 2 give tha bitch a rock
And she will fuck your hole damn crew
It might be yo wife and it might make u sick
Come home and see her mouth on tha dopeman's dick
Strawberry just look around you'll see her
But don't fuck around she'll give you gonnorhea
If people out there ain't hip to the fact
Strawberry iz a girl selling pussy 4 crack

Fat...fat...fat fat fat fat girl [2x]
(It's funky fresh Eazy E) new kid on tha block
And already got a fat girl on my jock
Now my story's kinda simple, so please take it simple
As I tell you a tale bout this big fat pimple
I was chillin on the ave, drinkin some booze
Saw a fatty comin my way, so what was I to do?
I busted a U, went tha other way again
but forgot that tha Avenue was a dead end
I turned around, here she came, stride for stride
funky fat like that, bout two thirty-five
Stampede was rushin, I double looked
and she had more chins than a chinese phonebook
Five four three ugly as can be, she said
[Ron-de-vu]
Hello Eazy E. Do you remember me? (I said no)
Huhu yes you do suga
My name is Bertha but you can call me booga
Remember the time when you were drunk at a party
We was slow dancin, give ya all this body

Oh my God got a fat girl on my jock

I got a fat girl on my jock
Fat girl
Got a fat girl on my jock
She gave me tha grin, I showed tha frown
and with a bare hug picked me off tha ground
Squeezion me tight, atttempted to bug me
Grabbed me by tha rear, said [Love me, hug me!]
I was hell, victim of a scandal
coz this girl's too much for E to handle
Broke tha bee's grip, started to run
Back to tha crib, grabbed tha elephant gun
She's grubbin, thighs rubbin in a hot pursuit
I loaded up tha gun bout ready to shoot
She kept on comin because of addiction
Legs on fire because of friction
My gun broke, now I was doomed
Dropped tha double barrel, grabbed tha harpoon
As I swung, tha fat girl fell
Lyin on tha ave just like a beach whale
That's tha story, it's quite ill
and all fat girls y'all besta chill
All overweight freaks stay off my block
Cause it's eerie to have a fat girl on your jock

But after I nut I might leave you
But first I must decieve you, because bitch I don't need you
And don't say that you love me too

It goes one for the treble, two for the bass, She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it ...
Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow

Then after graduation started givin' up the booty
In school, stuck her head in a feather

It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'
I wanted a date, she would'nt even be my friend
But now in the 1990's, I'd be praying that the bitch don't find me
Cuz she's got a gang o' kidz knuckle-heads and all dirty
And she's givin' pimp by a nigga that's 30
I saw her hangin' in the alley
Raggin' to her friends how she's ho'in' in de valley
All by herself, doin' on the whole strole
Commin' back home late night with the bankrob
You know a bitch like that makes me sick,
But I've heard that she sucks a good dick

It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]
At a high school dance -
Me and the niggaz bailed in
I saw her sittin' with her friends, With the clan,
So sexy, thought she was all that
She would'nt even look it up because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doorz
On the streets she's a late night feature
Walkin' home from school saw her suckin' a nigga'z dick, another bleacher
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut could'nt escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw her
There was'nt a nigga on the block
Late at night not gettin' done
So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course cuz my dick you it's harder than a telepole
Then again it don't concern me
Cuz there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot de ho'
I mean checkin' with de quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from gettin' sick -
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick
[Chorus:]
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it [yeaahh..]
Now I was at a club on a late late sunday
Peepin' at the bitches 'till the next day monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch who lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I locked her
She was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up
Back at the house she was bitch n' be ignorin'
And when she start to talk the ho' was kinda borin'
Yo, but now I got to dawn, see
Now she's dancin' on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shakin' that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans -
Just while I'm a take her to a room
But yo I mean a rest room
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grabbed her hand and she's with it
Oh and when she turned sobber should'nt have had admit it
So while she's dropped I'd better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick ..
[Chorus:]
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
Lick de big dick, baby, I wanna fuck this one
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it
""So there you have it - a job well done, but for now let me get back to what
I was doing""
She swallowed it .. She swallowed it ..
Get it all baby, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy
Suck this diiiiiick
Oh, she swallowed it .. get it all, suck this dick for daddy ..
Hey mothafuck, I want you to suck Dre's dick,
Then I want you to suck Yella dick
You already sucked Ren's dick ..
YOU BOYZ ARE DISGUSTING!
Just suck my dick bitch

Well it's because motherfuckers want to blast me
And run me outa my neighborhood
They label me as a dope dealer
Yo! And say that I'm no good
But I can't find jobs so niggers wouldn't have to go out
Gave up some dope on the corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A fifteen year old black kid will go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest
Why do I call myself a nigger, you ask me?
I guess it's the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin a job was murder
fuck flippin burgers
'Cause a deserve a nine-to-five I can be proud of
That I can speak loud of
And to help a nigger get out of.
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin paid like a mother fucker
A young brother who don't give a fuck about another
Why do I call myself a nigger, you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get faced down in the street
They throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President
Why do I call myself a nigger, you ask me?
Because my mouth is so mother fuckin nasty
bitch this, bitch that
Nigger this, nigger that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin fat
Gettin paid to say this shit here
Makin more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So, why not call myself a nigger?
It's better than pulling the trigger and goin up the river
And don't I get called a nigger anyway?
Booked as a motherfucker and locked away
So... so, cut out all that bull shit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life
(Niggers, crack-heads, thieves.
If there's a hell below, we're all gonna go.)
Nigger. Nigger. Nigger
Nigger. Nigger
Nigger, please
I'm treated like a fuckin disease.
You say: why can I call myself a nigger so quick?
Cause I can reach in my draws and pull out a bigger dick
Yo! niggers say nigger we cool
But, cracker say nigger not to fuck up
But I got to be a fast nigger
Not to be the last nigger
Or I have to beat your ass, nigger
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later
In a verse I curse
Because I [?] with this to keep my shit straight bumpin'
Murder created by the streets of Compton
I get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it
Because I know it
And if you think I'm fucking your wife
Your mother fuckin' right
Yo! Because I'm a nigger for Life
Nigger, this
Nigger, that
The actual fact is that I'm black
And bound to attract
The attention of another
I mean the other
But I'm a mother fucker that'll have them running for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothing
Except getting paid, getting bitches, and [?] with stitches
Which is all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say
The nigger's here to stay
But what about the fake niggers, the house niggers
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But NWA is outta your mother fuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a mother fuckin' thing
I call myself a nigger 'cause my skin won't whiten
I call myself a nigger 'cause the shit that I'm writing
Hypes me, hypes other mother fuckers around me
And that's the reason why they want to surround me
And ask me: why do I call myself a nigger-o
Ain't none of their fuckin' business 'cause I'll let the trigger go
So get out of my presence, and get out of my sight
'Cause MC Ren is a nigger for Life
You're a nigger 'til you die
If you're a poor nigger, then you're a poor nigger
If you're a rich nigger, you're a rich nigger
But you never stop being a nigger
And if you get to be educated, you's an education nigger
It's plain to see, you can't change me
'Cause I'm a be a nigger for Life

Once again beatin' on your mothafuckin' ear drumbs
Doin' much damage for all you slutty ass ho's
Yo, there was a bitch I knew on the avenue
She was gettin' G oh for a nut or two yo
I think her name was Clara
And she was garunteed to give a Muthafucka whatever he needs
To be perfectly honest she was a hooker
So I took her - a 100 yards, to the blvd
I told her ""I'll take care o' you, you take care o' me""
You've gott a P I M P and all I want is the money
She went to work and the nigguz were fiendin' yo
She had the biggest ass that you ever seen
In fact she was like medusa
Her tities fully grown
A look and your dick turns to stone yeah
Keepin' on mind that she was the kind that would find the time to get mine
Because she knows I'm not to be fucked with
She ain't crazy
Fuckin' with dre should be pushin' up daisies
She was the perfect ho' but what do you know
The bitch tried to gag me
So - I had to kill her
Yeah, straight hittin'
Now listen up and lemme tell you how I did it
Yo, I tied her to the bed
I was thinking the worst but yo I had to let my niggaz fuck her first yeah
Loaded up the 44 yo
Then I straight smoked the ho'
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
I was soft and she thank me
Coughed to the boss and got tossed
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outa here and that's how it turns out
Now Vikky Vikky Vikky, she's very tricky
She put her hicky on top of my dick
Sick betsy - she told me she loved me
And she wanted to keep me
If only she can have the dick with me
I said I wanted but baby you gotta hold up
If I was happy with somethin' that I could fold up
We can do this - she said her husband was rich
Then I knew I had the bitch
Yo She wrote a cheque name me a cheque
In the name of a bitch who was strugglin' at the same game
All I wanted to do was get P-A-I-D
Just a little somethin' for fuckin' me
Yo Everything was cool but Vikky concerned me
Her husband was the District Auterny
So, before he found out he was crossed up
'Bout his bitch I was fuckin' I had to tossed her
And put you slick - some nigga never forget
A dead bitch can't tell a nigga shit
One less bitch you gotta worry about
She's outa here and that's how it turned out
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
[Muthafuckin' right!]
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
Thinkin' about money, and lookin' at a prostitute
The bitch was cute, so now I had to excecute
And shoot game like a real nigga
With a still trigga
Convince her to move up to somethin' bigga
I think I had a flashback though
'Cause I said ""fuck it""
Loped and Choked and Smoked to the ho' like this :
""bitch, it's all about Dre
The money money money and this all I gotta say""
Of course she came with me
And remained with me
'Till the bitch felt lamed and ashamed to be
Workin' that trick shit
'Cause niggaz knew that she was someone
A little later though she called 1
In the chest and I knew that it was commin'
By who and how the all act would be done?
So what?
One less bitch you gotta worry about
But that ain't how it turned out..
Yo, there was a bitch named her out and shot her
Straight to the Muthafuckin' trigger and said ""I got her!""
But I had better plans to give her the blues
Like dumpin' her in the river with sea net shoes
I knew my money was commin' up sho'
And the thought that the stupid bitch thought she'd never get cought
Came home early and straight bust her ass
On the couch with the other nigga countin' my cash
I should've known she was like the motha ho's
I told the 2 Muthafuckaz to take off their clothes
Butt naked nothin' left but the shoes
I had up a 9 so they could'nt refuse
I shot the nigga he was outa there
And tied the bitch to the Muthafuckin' chair
Now there's one less bitch I gotta worry about
Everybody out, that's how it turns out
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
[.... MIX with Easy E sayin':]
In reality -
A fool is one who believes that all women are ladies
A nigga is one who believes that all ladies are bitches,
And all bitches are created equal.
To me - all bitches are the same :
Money hungry scandlist groopy ho's that's always riding on a nigga's
dick.
Always in a nigga's pocket and when the nigga runs out of money
The bitch is gone in the wind.
To me :
ALL BITCHES AIN'T shit!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!
One less,
One less,
One less bitch you gotta worry about!

The motherfucking saga continues...
All of you who don't believe in the real gangsta shit,
Cause when it comes to the real niggaz,
It makes the shit they're much harder to deal with.
Yeah, above the laws in this motherfucker,
Like Mafia for life, down with the real niggaz 4 life.
Ha-ha, yo sweet-talk, tell 'em what the fuck we're here for...
Well I write ya, USE, Compton, Watts, The Wood,
All across the motherfucking USA.
They know I'm walking through the valley of real niggaz,
I should fear no man on the motherfucking planet, hit me one.
Cause I've been to the mountain top y'all,
And I have been seeing through the eyes of a real nigga.
Yo, what you think about the real niggaz 187?
Yo, they make some of the coooooolest shit I had never heard,
Yo, when we came, G, I almost gave it up,
To the ruthless motherfucking gangstas.
Fear no man...
...because you're shit man yourself,
Time to put the world at yourself man.
Me not seeing bobba-clot mobbing to see a pussy-clot run,
Bob-bob-bob-bob-bob, keep Babylon on the run, see...
[Ren:]
The real niggaz is back, cause there's to many bullshit records out,
Niggaz beat it for what we put out.
But you don't have to wait no longer,
Because the new album is out and the shit is much stronger.
So many groups made three albums or more,
And their weak-ass shit is still sitting in the record-store.
They wonder why it never sold,
Niggaz rapping since the seventies and still never went gold.
Our first record sold two million copies,
That's because you other motherfuckers are sloppy.
You came out the streets and crossed over,
And after that your career is fucking over.
Because after that you're not around,
So shut the fuck up, and witness the sound of some real niggaz.
[Eazy:]
Yeah, motherfucker.
Keeping all you busters on the run in ninety-one, kick that shit Ren.
[Ren:]
Most niggaz can't understand,
And never will if they ain't part of the ruthless Mafia-clan.
Niggaz is dedicated to the streets,
With hyped fucking lyrics and a dope ass beat.
The songs will never come soft, because I come off,
So don't get in my way or motherfucker you'll be cut off.
And it's something you can move your lips to,
To wrap around my dick and suck if it fits you.
And let me now if you wanna ride the D-I-C-K,
All day that's with no play.
Cause ain't no rap group out, that I know,
That makes me wanna listen to the radio.
All I hear is motherfuckers trying to make a comeback with lovesongs,
And that shit is whack.
And that's why your ass ain't around,
Cause you don't have the motherfucking sound of a real nigga.

Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should of covered your muthafucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt 'cause you's a sucker
And you ass up high so I can kick the muthafucker
Don't try to hang your best abroad
'Cause my foot will be so far up you ass, you're get hemroids
Before you try to fuck wit Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10
[Dr. Dre]
First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
Other words if a muthafucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
But how the fuck you think a rapper last
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you muthafucking carbon copy
[MC Ren]
Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and not beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak muthafuckas biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggaz pick up your record is cause they thought it was us
[Dre]
Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you
You can't harm me, alarm me
'Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggaz wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Try us and take it
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in
[Chorus:]
It's the real thing, you are now real, real niggaz, niggaz
[Ren]
You can run but you can't hide, you know I'm a find'cha
'Cause a nigga like Ren's only 2 steps behind'cha
Don't look back, 'cause you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my muthafucking stage without nike's on
Don't say it's psychoand then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow
[Dre]
All these niggers wit the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a muthafucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it's the shit we wear
On my muthafucking dick
But I'm a love it when you drop like a muthafucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, 'cause if you're mislead
You get a muthafucking bullet in your dome head
[Eazy-E]
Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit some real niggaz playing for keeps
But you muthafuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
[Ren](Now how much harder can another nigga get)
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
[Dre](Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm a muthafucka that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real
[Dre]
Real niggaz, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggaz in black
Bow down to the King's and Raider's hats
[Ren]
They played out, that's what niggaz were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't happening
People had thought we was finished and then done wit
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record come, I'll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggaz not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
Because if I let you slide, it's just 'cause you lucked up
Don't come in my face again, because I'm a floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitudes a little bigga
'Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggaz
[Dre]
Lost in a muthafucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that gladdest
Sucking muthafuckas like you, making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigamortis
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga wit hard, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that's pay to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, NWA, criticize for what we say
But I'm a do the shit anyway
'Cause I'm the muthafucking doctor,never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the muthafucking break in
[Chorus]
[Ren]
NWA , straight ouut muthafucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990's
Yo, Dr. Dre, DJ Yella, Eazy-E
And I am MC Ren, yo, NWA taking over this muthafucka y'all

I got a case of spitting in a muthafukers face
So me and my ace we got a taste
Of a muthafukers billy club he took his gun and
Put it to my head and said nigga start running
So tell me what's the next episode
Is he crazy, does he want to chase me and waste me
I thought run nigga run but I caught myself
Because my secondary thought was death
I get hit hard real but still muthafuker said
I want another black muthafuker dead
Niggaz ain't good for shit for me
'Cause this is a race fo second class
So get your ass up against the wall bitch
And then he tried
They jumped me but the punk became a victim of a walkby
Fuking wit Dre, you can't afford to be an asshole
It's just another way to let you know
Niggaz send them,niggaz send them, niggaz send them
Punk can't fuk wit me

Straight from the streets of the CPT
Telling you why real niggaz don't die

Real niggaz don't die 'cause they eventually multiply
The niggaz are wit it but taking out on I
Because the times are so wrong, got to stay so strong
Niggaz got to keep going on and on
And don't let no pail face, they throw your ass in a cell race
Have you resident suck a pie in a jail space
That's what they want to do 'cause the system is fuked around
I try to let you know what the record it's underground
They don't give a fuk about a nigga
They would rather pull the trigger
And have you running from barrels smiling saying geez
So nigga get smart and rebel back
I'm not wit that black just so I'm not gonna nail that
All I see is niggaz getting harrass
We can't do nothing about it but get a foot in they ass
Yo, but a very nigga grabbed a nine
And started shooting muthafukers, it would put them in line
And that's how it's suppose to be
When the pussy ass niggas try to fuk wit me
Yo because the shoes let the dry
To kill a nigga cause nigga a muthafuking real nigga don't die
[Chorus]
I'm a muthafuking nigga wit an attitude
[Eazy-E]
Oh let the good die young, so they make me young and bad
Putting ass kickings on the niggaz that never had
So I guess that makes me tough shit
Straight up gangsta, bum nigga to fuk wit
So how can a nigga die when he's causing the bloodshed
By shooting muthafukas in the head
Trying to make a nigga extinct because they fear me
But never want to hear me
So I'm a let 'em know how a nigga's living
Checking for muthafukas cause nobody ain't giving a damn thing
To a nigga, a real nigga
So I'm living by the muthafuking trigger
Cause a nigga ain't afraid of being locked up
I'm out of luck, so why should I give a fuk
But they still want to try
To kill a nigga like me but muthafuking real niggaz don't die

They don't want peace, they want a nigga deceased
So he'll cease to be a problem, and by the way the perform
It seems the Klan gave the white police another uniform
And yo the black police, the house niggaz
They gave you a motherfucking gun, so I guess you figure
You made out, good to go, but you didn't know
They would stick your black ass back in the ghetto, yo

Freebase - they put in the neighborhood in the first place

Motherfuckers from high crime areas view the police as a threat
And that's some shit you betta not forget
[Verse Two: Eazy-E]
Eazy E's the name feared by most
When, a lil nigga is thrown in the pen
But on the streets there's two kinds of people
White rich fucks and the ones who get harassed like me
Pull over to the side, routine for me
Tearin up my shit, like they lookin for a key of cocaine
But they never find the shit
Ain't got nuttin better to do and nobody else to fuck wit
Thinkin everything is stolen
But can't face facts that a young black nigga's just rollin
Making more money than they ever make
Taking more shit than they ever take
Yo pigs are made to kill, and no regret and
Keep your hand on your weapon shoot his ass and start steppin
Cause I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck about nothin
So let me explain a lil somethin, yo
See, I got this problem, a big problem...
Cops don't like me, so I don't like motherfucking cops

Get out of the fuckin car!
Wait a god damn minute what the hell did I do?
Hey just shut the fuck up black bitch
Wait a minute, you ain't gotta be pullin me by my motherfuckin hair! Let
Go of my motherfuckin hair!
Hey just step the fuck back and shut up!
Get your motherfuckin hands off of me!
Calm down, calm down now... listen, we're gonna go around this corner, and
You're gonna suck me and my partner's dicks, or you're gonna
Be one black dead nigger bitch
Police brutality is common in my neighborhood
That's why I hate them motherfuckers
[Verse Three: MC Ren]
I said fuck the police but with a little more force
And maybe now I get my point across
It's a lot here that's goin on, just open your eyes and look
Everyday a young nigga is took
Off the face of the street by a police
It's like they gotta a nigga chained on a short leash
You can't leave out the city that they shacked up
Cause if you do that's the right they got you jacked up
It's embarassin because you know they justice, but all you can do
Is say fuck this, because if you move, that's all she wrote
So what? The excuse to shoot, or they rather stomp your head
Til you're dead with the steel toe boot
Harassin me with some kind of mind game
Actin like a nigga just was born with a gang-name
You call that right but when you're black there's no right
Some recreational shit was only a gang fight
So shootin at the cops was a street thing
To waste time have to explain don't do cocaine
But everything was done just for peace
To retaliate, on the fuckin police, so I'm sayin
[Chorus:]
Fuck the police! fuck, fuck, fuck the police!
Fuck
Fuck the police! fuck, fuck the police!
[The final episode]
[Episode Three:]
Hey Juan, look at the piece of ass man
Watch out watch out watch out homes!
Oh shit man you fucked up, you hit a police car
I didn't see that piece of caca!
Better act like you don't speak ingles homes
...
What the fuck? Get your ass out of there, I've had enough
Of your raggedy ass motherfuking shit!
No! No me pagan, por que me pagan, no! Por favor, no, no!
Por que?
[Chorus 2x]

HAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM..
Get it all baby ..
Get it all baby ..
Get it all baby ..
""what you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it ..
Suck this dick for daddy
She swallowed it ..
Usin' that lips
She swallowed it ..
It's the world's biggest dick
""what do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
Slow is the tempo
Now talkin' but an info
So peep it up here goes the info
This is the bitches and the ho's crew
She get it as much we make bets on who's the ho's we'd love to go through
And for the dick that she does give her a drum role
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And a list of videotaper
And if you got a gang of niggaz, the bitch would let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks, and lickin' up nutz
And they even take de broomstick at the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take"" She ax's
""To make MC Ren start gooshin' up vanilla shake""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very Irresistable
I could'nt pay the bitch to quit
Cuz the ho' was doin' some ole' crazy dick
That made me start havin' a fit'
Cuz the bitch sucks de hellified dick .. [suck this dick]
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!
Now one night night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggaz straight drove in
I thought they wuz commin' to start trouble but no
Five niggaz in the back it was de neighborhood ho'
Now what do you expect they're gonna dogg her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windowz are all foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit' cuz de bitch that I'm with
Sayz no dickin' on the 1st date dick
Now I'm like - Damn! I wish I was in the bucket
To be with 6 niggaz with the ho' and I can dick it
So I told de ho' I was with that I'm goin' to de snack bar -
And got de dick out de car.
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggaz that I knew they let me in yo
And my turn was like next
I could'nt see a face, all I saw was de pussy and the chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt the order
Peep over the seat - OH dick! it's the preacher's daughter!
And she's only 14 and a ho'
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But was it passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' backtide
I told the bitch to do it quick:
""You little ho' hurry up and suck my dick!""
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!
Now I'm a break it down with a fact -
Since the last ""Just don't bite it"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they could'nt quit
Cuz not even bustin' the bitches today they love the dick
And those are the main one's that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knowz the bitches are used to it
So fellows, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never suck a dick punch the bitch in the eye
And then the ho' will fall to the ground
Then you'll open up her mouth -
Put your dick in and move the dick around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on de raw
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck a meet off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nutt out of a dick just like dreino
Get the last drop, unclog in de back
Then the stupid bitch is at that with the same dick de next night
Because she just can't quit
Cuz she's addicted, addicted, addicted, addicted
She's addicted, addicted, she's addicted to suck a good dick
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the world's biggest dick""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it .. Get it all baby!

Now this is some shit that's from the Dayz of Wayback,
When niggas in Compton first started to jack.
When the bitches wouldn't give you no pussy if you wasn't sellin' drug,
So many bitches in my neighborhood got mugged.
They always loved that shit. They want a nigga that's sellin' Ks.
But nowadays they workin' at Mickey D's.
But in the Dayz of Wayback
I couldn't be laid back,
Because I needed ends and I made that.
I get the nine from my nigga that he lend me and
Start robbin' muthafuckas, just like cowboys and indians.
Anything it took to get paid.
A nigga like Ren already had the plane made.
And I was in it to win it and not to lose.
And shit, it start blowin' up, once I lit the fuse.
And police couldn't touch me because I was payin'em.
But not with no money - Yo, I was frayin'em.
And never get caught because nobody is snitch,
But one hoe did - so Ren had to shoot the bitch!
Now she's in a coffin and my life is better off and
'Cause everybody knows who's the bossin':
That black nigga that they call Ren.
You fuck with me, you gotta fuck with a Mac-10.
So listen to me as I reminisce the Dayz of Wayback...
So check it out y'all...
It was once a time in the Dayz of Wayback
When niggas was gettin' jacked.
In fact it was one I used to pass through up,
And kickin' ass through up.
Muthafuckin' Compton Massacre...
Now let me tell you a little something about Compton
When I was a kid and puttin' my bid in.
Yo, Compton was like still water - just strictly calm.
Now it's like muthafuckin' Vietnam.
Everybody killin', tryin' to make a killin',
Niggas stealin', muthafuckas willin' to dealin'.
With so many ways to come up
The average nigga didn't give a fuck
About another muthafucka in this game and
Claimin' what he claimin',
Livin' like he livin',
Killin' after killin'.
Murder was a dirty job. To rob a dead man
Was the best plan 'cause a dead man never ran.
But now your best friend is your worst friend.
Greed, cash the fee. Make a me more some of what you holdin'.
So now your shit is stolen
And you and your niggas start rollin'.
Yo, to get your shit back ain't a word of.
Muff? It's more murder, more murder, more murder.
They wanna make you think that it's a crack thang,
Or a black thang
Or some niggas in a muthafuckin' gang...
But guns and money they go together like the Ku Klux Klan
A nigga brung up and strung up.
Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Rememberin' the days that's past me...
Yo, never givin' niggas a chance to rest.
The ghetto is like a fuckin' survival test.
And number one way for you to pass,
Yo, get treated like a king and they'll crown your ass.
They never in the wrong though,
So I made a song so
Muthafuckas had know
If, yo, livin situations make you wanna get a gat...
That's 'cause you livin' in the Dayz of Wayback...

Cutting ducks no slack so keep your bitch ass back
Deadly, yeah kicking it, the solo style

Hanging tough I'm the leader, ain't no need to pretend

Be warned, it's hard to try and hold a project born
Saying shit that you like, never wearing no Nike

And a micstand, I don't need no band to play

What! Niggaz can't fuck with us
DMX:
Get at me dog. My niggaz
Styles:
That's my word!
Verse One: DMX
I'm the type to kick back and look at shit,
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you locked in sleep away camp.
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggaz stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like ""What's that oooh""
What's that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggaz toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggaz thinking they shitty, what a pity
Lemme show them niggaz shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal
Verse Two: Styles
Y'all niggaz fucking with the L.O.X.
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggaz wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggaz get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggaz don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggaz come through then we lock it
(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)
Verse Three: Jadakiss
With no glocks I'm in your town with five locks
Take five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots
It's the L.O.X, three niggaz that listen and watch
And nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot
It be that new flow, my niggaz, fly niggaz
Always high niggaz, ready to die niggaz
As far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing
Lemme get the one clearance like a sample
'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped
Left somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp
Niggaz is done, since poppy raised his son
When bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums
Whether you can flow or not ain't the issue
You don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle
Take a puff then a swig
Think about how I'm gonna
hold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig
Your money is low, and your flow been late
While I be coming through with new shit with tint plates
The only higher than money, is respect
The only thing hotter than my click, is a tek
So when I hit you with these last bars around your neck
You gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga
(WHAT, YEAH)
Verse Four: Sheek Luchion
My bank account be doubling
While you niggaz stay in trouble and
L.O.X. stay fly
Three niggaz jig-I
Shit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law
Kingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular
It's Sheek baby
Chicks hate to see me on the Soul Train
With Don Cornelius
And all they got is alias
To work with
To catch Sheek, y'all niggaz besta work quick
Now that I'm eating right, plus living well
So nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell
Ain't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan
With a black master full 850 full suspension
While you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years
My stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce
Small black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama
Keep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product
I learn things, just by watching y'all niggaz make the wrong moves
Now I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools
Y'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit
Cats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it
P.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B.
Your shit be so-so, low pro.
On a bus before the cars show
On some old joystick shit, no mirrors
I can see behind me through the cameras
Flip plates, make the whole block go bananas

Let us pray.
I thank you Lord for my birth, and everythings thats followed.
I thank you Lord for today, and I will pray for tomorrow.
I thank you Lord for the love of my life and a friend.
I made a promise, and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end.
I thank you Lord for your guidance, cause thats all that counts.
And right here, right NOW, Lord this is your house.
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light.
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight.
I don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me.
Cause I need you here wit me, without you in my life it's empty.
I think back to how some people did me like, violence was the remedy.
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy.
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know.
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody, won't go.
So I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see.
And I thank you for the love that, they've given to me.
I will not abuse it, nor will I lead them astray.
See, I love 'em like children, that I see everyday.
And I pray, no WE pray together, get us through the bad weather,
and we love you forever.
Let your thought, and my heart, go hand in hand.
I first thought, but to start, but I stand a man.
And for as long as I can, as long as you permit me.
Please give me, the strength I need to live.
Bare wit me.
Amen.
We each walk the path, that we've chosen.
(sung)
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law of
the Lord.
Lord you left me stranded, and I don't know why.
Told me to live my life, and now I'm ready to die.
Ready to fly, I cry but I shed no tears.
You told me you were dead.
Those fears, is for years.
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'.
Somtimes I think that all you do at me, is just listen.
I thought that I was special, that's what you told me.
Hold me, stop actin' like you don't know me!
When I do so bad that it sends you away from me.
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me.
""My child, I'm here as I've always been. It is you who in a way, and
now I'm back again. What did I say?""
Follow your word and be true.
""What did you do?""
Well, what I wanted to do.
""What have you seen?""
Darkness and Hell at a glance.
""What do you want?""
All I want is another chance!
Ready to meet him, cause I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law
of the Lord.
""Just because you went away, my doors are not locked. When you
come back home, all you gotta do is knock.""
You see, I left home a boy, but returned as a man.
Full grown, but I am still not able to stand.
""I gave you a hand!""
But I was lookin' the wrong way.
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray.
And that prayer, took me from here, to over there.
Back to over here, now it got me like, ""Where?""
Do I belong? Do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart.
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start?
""Thou shalt not steal!""
But what if he stole from me?
""Thou shalt not kill!""
But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
""Thou shalt not take my name in vain, no matter how hard it rains,
withstand the pain.""
Ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war, is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him.
Our Father, who art in heaven.
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27.
No longer afraid to knock on your door!
Not scared anymore to lose my life in a war!
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord.
Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword.
But now that I've seen, what I need to see, please take me where I
need to be...
""What have you learned?""
It's better to tell the truth than a lie!
""What have you learned?""
To love my life, until I die!
""What have you learned?""
Violence isn't always the key!
""What have you learned?""
You can't always believe what you see!
""What have you learned?""
It's better to forgive and forget!
""What have you learned?""
Give as you expect to get!
""What have you learned?""'
That I can't go on without you!
""What have you learned?""
I must have been a fool to ever doubt you!
Ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war, is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.

I'm tired of answering for shit in MY LIFE

So butterflies can't reach my stomach
to get my heartbeat jumpin and my blood flow pumpin
So my life means some'n and it ain't no frontin
for the respect you get for the work in the climbin
For the ways that's beside me and the niggaz that don't like me
Got a pistol and my iron if you wanna get to firin

[Chorus]
Ain't no sunshine when it's on
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when it's on, cause when it's on
ya niggaz know to be gone, everytime, cause we don't play
[DMX]
""Who turned out the lights?"" is what niggaz be sayin
Now you don't wanna fight, but y'all niggaz be playin
Thinkin it's alright, keep playin with that role
And you gonna know the night, when you layin in that hole
Dirt gettin tossed in yo' grave, now it's all over
Preacher said ""You was brave,"" but now it's all over
You just one of the many, plenty, I done gave it to
(*boom*) Ain't no savin you
No matter how many tears your moms' cried
Ain't gon bring yo' ass back, plus in hell you gon' fry
Why?  But now the only two relative questions
is ""Do we bury him or burn? Any suggestions?""
Either way, you up out of here for good
Now when niggaz mention your name they knockin on wood
Did I, get my, point across?
Another body on the shottie another joint I toss
[Chorus]
+ everytime, cause we don't play..
everytime, cause we don't play..
[DMX]
It ain't no sunshine when the Dark Man comes out
And I want mine, so I plan to keep my gun out
We got four 9's, so niggaz run in and run out
But I bust mine, cause I'd like to hear some shouts
Get at me dog, niggaz know how its goin dizzy
When it comes to that flow, I gets busy
Who is he?  Dark Man, of the unknown
(GRRR, ARF!)  One dog, one bone
Now who ain't goin home?  Looks like you
You hear strike one, talkin shit, strike two
Won't be a strike three, cause I don't play fair
I'ma look you in your eye while he hit you from the rear
Be like - yeah, holdin you up cuz you fallin (WHAT?)
The Lord ain't comin, 'til niggaz stop callin
You was ballin, a minute ago, in it for dough
'til it was, ""Yo, I swear to God, I didn't know""

+ everytime, cause we don't play..
everytime, cause we don't play..
[DMX]
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Whatchu think you gon' get, fuck around with my dough
Just so it ain't no mistakes, this is my show
One (one) two (two) three, here I go!
Your shit is quick, and your shit is slick, but this shit is thick
Ain't you hear this shit?  Damn right, I can finish shit
If you caught that verse without a rewind you can see mine
but you be blind, I'll do it 360 and come up from behind
Tap you on your shoulder, have you turnin around
Hit you with somethin that'll have you burnin the ground
Be like, ""Damn, ain't nuttin left of money, but a pile of ash""
Life is good, so please enjoy it while it lasts
Cause you know ain't got much longer to go
The quicker you go depends on the stronger the flow
And niggaz know, I don't give a FUCK, right or wrong
There ain't no sunshine when it's on

We can draw (Choose your weapons) or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
My avalanche it came with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half eskimo
My flows move like endo
Turn ten nickels into ten loads, outta ten stoves
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I won it
In the helicopter, warmin before morning
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga, Doc
Fuck ya momma on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys will get smacked in the club

Bring me some more ass to whoop on

Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop of high yellow cinderella, Meth forever

I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime, its a crime when I drop ??? design
That tick it, tick boom, blow your mind

Can't be done like tryin to find a penny in the sea

Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around and gettin ones

Pull my ?dart gun? and bust sixteen until its dead

I want you to ask yourself one question
If you had twenty four hours to live, what would you do
That's some deep shit right there, a lot of pressure
How would you handle it
Mase, what would you do
[Mase]
Yo, I'd turn out all the hoes that's heterosexual
Smack conceited niggas right off the pedestal
I'd even look for my dad that I never knew
And show him how I look in my Beretta, too
I'd do good shit like take kids from the ghetto
Show them what they could have if they never settle
Take every white kid from high class level
Show 'em what Christmas like growin' up in the ghetto
Teach niggas how to spend, stack the rest
Give blunts to the niggas under massive stress
Give every bum on the street cash to invest
And hope Harlem will blow up be my last request
[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo if I had twenty four hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket
Then go get a jar from Branson
And make sure I leave my mother the money to take care of grandson
Load the three power, hop in the Eddie Bauer
And go give all six to that papi that sold me flour
Get a fresh baldy, make a few calls
Shop at the mall, shoot a lil' ball
Have all of my bitches on one telly at the same time
Spread it out on different floors
And I'm gon' play lotto, for what
Even though I ain't gon' be here tomorrow, so what
[Black Rob]
You know when I was close to the ledge
I'd probably be in the wedge
With this bare spanish mami playin' 'tween my legs
Then I'm off to get choke and smoke one a them dreads
And get that bitch from '89 that gave us up to the feds
Thought of momma, wrote her a note, we ain't close
I hate her boyfriend so I put one in his throat
Fuck around and sniff an ounce of raw, bust the four
Fours, pull out my dick and take a piss on the floor
Jump in the whip, git them cats I wanted to git
Since the Tavern on the Green robbery in eighty-six
Went home took a shower in nice cold water
And spent my last hours wit my son and my daughter
[1] - If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go
What would you do
Who would you screw
And who would you wanna notify
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die
If you had twenty four hours to live just think
Where would you go
What would you do
Who would you screw
And who would you wanna notify
Or would yo' ass deny that yo' ass about to die
[Sheek]
What hey yo, if I had twenty four nigga gotta get the raw
Run all them papi's spot, put one in his head at the door
For the times that I paid for twenty an he gave me twelve
The other eight had to be baking soda by itself
So papi fuck you, you dead now, I'm off to the bank
With those bricks in a bookbag and a stolen Jag I just grabbed
Went in there grabbed the bank teller wit the pretty face
Fuck her in the safe, and have her take me to my place
We'll make a kid but that's selfish and that'll be bad
For my son to have the same shit his pops just had
And when I'm down to twenty three, I'm a be strapped wit TNT
Run up in city hall and take the judges wit me
[Styles]
If I had twenty four hours to live, I'd probably die on the fifth
Run in the station squeezin the inf'
I'll be waitin' to get to hell and bust down Satan
Styles' on this shit and I got spot vacant
Back to the twenty four I make it out the precinct
Shootin niggas that I hate in they face while they eatin'
I'm on the job robbin' every so-called Don
Give the money to my moms and tell her that I'm gone
I would school my little brother that niggas mean him harm
He should learn to tell the future without readin' palms
When they come in with the bullets, you prepared with the bomb
So fuck bein' violent get stocks and bonds
[DMX]
Twenty four left until my death
So I'm gon' waste alot of lives, but I'll cherish every breath
I know exactly where I'm goin', but I'mma send you there first
And with the shit that I'll be doin', I'mma send you there worse
I've been livin' with a curse, and now it's all about to end
But before I go, say hello to my little friend
But I gots to make it right, reconcile with my mother
Try to explain to my son, tell my girl I love her
C-4 up under the coat, snatch up my dog
Turn like three buildings on Wall Street, into a fog
Out with a bang, you will remember my name
I wanted to live forever, but this wasn't fame

If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb

Hit em with work cause yo that's ma lil man
He asked a few questions bout tha game and I told him
So when he made a bad move it was ma place 2 scull him
Never told him nuttin wrong
Kept it fair
He didn't listen so I might as been talkin to the air

Go on before I change ma mind cause u know you should be dead

But I also knew that the decision I just made
Went against the rules of the game that we play

You got a minute for yo' son father, I need to talk
I'm so tired of tryin to run father, let's take a walk
I'm so sorry for what I done father, it ain't my fault
But the devil's been on my back lately, he's like a hawk
You never give us more than we can handle, but it's gettin hard
And I'm a strong individual, but I need you God
Lot of things that I used to, I don't wanna
run the streets like I used to, I know I'm gonna
speak the word for you one day
Up in there like, ""Hallelujah!"" on Sunday
I thank you Lord for the blessings that you gave me
And for my life with the blessings you have saved me
And for my wife you have carried me enough times - and that's the truth
Married me to rough times, throughout my youth
And through it all I saw that you was still with me
I was that one lost sheep and you was comin to get me

Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..
Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..
Lord you got me like.. your love got me like..

I look at life a little different now, since you hugged me
And I always loved my peoples, but now they love me
Thank you for the love Lord, we praise ya
Jacob's descendants, from Africa to Asia
Pleadin the blood of Christ over our life
Wrong or right, just help us make it through the night and we'll
shout yo' name in times of need
And times of joy, and, when we bleed
And, when we are overcome with greed
You ain't gon' half to tell me twice, I'ma take heed
And because of what you've given me, I know you'll deliver me
And I won't drown no matter how deep the river be
You are the strength I, never knew I had
Kept the heart good when they told me it was bad
All praises due to ya
That's why I had to dedicate somethin new to ya, thank you father
[Chorus]

Uhh..
I never knew a love like, this before
Messin with the thug life I, missed it all
You opened the doors and, let me in
I'm down for the cause so, let's begin
Prayers that you give to me I give to them
Same way you live in me I live in them
Life is a blessing now
You got me smilin from inside of my heart, when inside it was dark
And it doesn't rain anymore
Only sunshine, no pain anymore, I really love my
You washed away the tears with the fears
I'm happier than I've ever been in my life, the whole thirty years
You know that! one day I'll speak the word
You know that! when I do I will be heard
You know that! you gave me a permanent smile
And you know this father because I'm yo' child, what?

We miss you, Kato! Kato!
[Verse 1]
Started of two dawgs wit the the goals
Nuttin but two dawgs walkin the same road
Two different cultures, but had the same heart
Enjoyed seein the light, but lived in the dark
5th album bumped heads in the park alot
Was a pride brother, didnt like to bark alot
Came correct, when he came, he gained respect
So i gave respect, we shared the same respect
Two names in wreck now on the circles
Two brothers with good heart, but if you start, two brothers that will hurt you
You know how that dirt, hittin four corners
Earh! Earh! Earh! Earh!, right back upon us
God tried to warn us but sometimes we dont see
When i first heard im like ""this cant be, yall niggaz is buggin
Got the wrong information or suttin, please tell me that these niggaz is frontin
God No""
[Chorus DMX (Magic)]
Dawgs that i called my friends
Praying for all my friends

[Verse 2]
If its ok, let me kick it wit you for a minute
There left unsaid dawg we wasnt finished
Never got to say thank you for bein a friend
Dawgs! for Life! and you, will role to the end
Held dawg down didnt let a day go by
Everytime dawg came to the shy (what!)
I was good, trips out to Phoenix with the scrambling squad
If i come back to Phoenix im like, damn its hard
To accept the fact (Uh), that you wont be comin back (Uh)
But i hope your comin back (Uh), cause i wont accept the fact (Uuhh!)
When you came to New York, You had to come to the crib
And vise-versa (Yeah!), thats just how we did
Remote-contol cars (What!), we would race all day
It was adventure, we would chase all day (Yeah!)
So im not gon say good-bye ma nigga (uh uh)
Instead i would rather (Rather) focus on the time we spent together
Thats what matters (for real)
[Chorus DMX (Magic)]
Dawgs that i called my friends

DMX what what (uhh uhh uhh)
[Chorus - DMX]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggaz you just don't know
But niggaz is about to go oh no oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggaz wanna stop mine
Ya niggaz must be out yo mind, I don't know why
What the fuck is you niggaz pressin me for
I saw more ass than a ho and you stressin the raw
If I was testin your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me cuz you dont even know me
Nigga check me (come on)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin
WRONG: Then die from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin
RIGHT: Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin
Bad decisions lead to last decisions
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin (what)
Take it over there now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you he's about to attack you
Still standin here faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, fuck is y'all niggaz tellin me
I'm the only nigga, walkin the streets with four felonies
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggaz is strugglin
Leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin
[Chorus]
Give it to niggaz just how they give it to, me
Hit em in a rhyme because I'm a MC
Been a lot of places most niggaz won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggaz won't, be
Let your man hold somethin now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggaz want, raw
Niggaz laugh at me and was mad at me
Cuz the way life was goin had to be a, tragedy
But after me, it's over, I'ma take the whole verse
I'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggaz go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it
so if I see it, I'ma dot it, where to hide it
you gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
and hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it
COME ON
[Chorus]
Niggaz don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin shit
What I'ma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'ma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kiddin WHY
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin
And I'ma stay flippin flows, rippin shows
Strippin ho's, gettin dough let me go
And nigaz know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this cuz when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggaz necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast
COME ON

What good is it..
for a man to, gain the world..
yet lose his own soul, in the process
[Bell] God loves you, yes he does
Said you're alright with him
[DMX] I wonder..
[Chorus: Regina Bell (repeat 2X)]
I know you never seen him but don't fight with him
You're gonna make it through the night to the light with him
Uhh, you're alright with him
I said you're alright with him

I'm callin out to you Lord, because I need your help
See once again I'm havin difficulty savin myself
behavin myself, you told me what to do, and I do it
But every and now and then, gets a little harder to go through it
Losin friends, day by day
I'm in so much pain when I'm here Lord, please take me away
I put you here to do a job, and your work ain't done
To live is to suffer, but you're still my son
And there will be a time when you shine as bright as the stars
But there won't be a, his or hers, just ours
Then you'll see what I've been tryin to show you, all these years
Do the right thing; cause after the tears, come the cheers
I will, my Lord, with my heart, and my soul
That's gonna be how I roll, from now until I'm old
Lead and I'll follow, you take away the sorrow
I'ma sleep on what you said and holla back tomorrow
[Chorus]
[DMX]
I want you to know Lord, that for what you've given me I'm thankful
Sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful
You gave us power in our words, so I think before I speak
And that way when I speak, they know I'm here to teach
Can't tell em nothin wrong, cause I love em too much
I reach a lot of people, and Lord, I'm lovin the touch
But deep inside, I've got somethin that's workin against
everything I know is right, what I know makes sense
That's when you must fight harder, than you've ever fought before
cause what you've got goin on inside you is a war
between good and evil, be careful of those who wanna be you
They smile, but are not really happy when they see you
Be careful of the ones that always wanna get you high
Cause when the time comes, that one'll let you die
Listen to me! I'm here, but I can only help you
if you want me to help, what do you want for yourself
[Chorus]
[DMX]
My Lord, my saviour, don't judge my behaviour
but instead, take what's in my heart and put it in my head
See I guess I really never knew, how proud I made you
My life is yours, my soul I gave you
I don't know if I'll do good enough (he's by your side)
And we both know the hood is rough (right by your side)
Sometimes I don't know what to do (X, dry your eyes)
But I know what I gotta do (it'll be alright)
You keep givin me the word, and I'll put it to song
Talk to me, I'll talk to them, and we can't go wrong
This is the start of somethin strong, and this is just the start of it
Praises to you my Lord, for lettin me be a part of it
I was that kid that, been there, did that
Became ashamed so I hid that
But, ain't no longer with that
Use me as an example - if I can do, then they can too
With the Lord behind us, there ain't nothin that we can't do

He's by your side
Right by your side

Chickenheads  know I  be the ColonelCause I burn eternal  mixed wit the inferno
So be careful, 'fore I burn youYou better learn dude, yeah I heard you
but I'ma hurt you, but you don't know'My versatile, is a virtue
Ruff Ryders be the team, which meansa lot cream, lot of schemes
Lot of beams to make your stock drop, right on the seams
Nigga here is too hot and too much for you to touch
Better tell your man cause I'm too tough Indubitably, too dust
Do you bust?  Cause we doYou need to ask the people, but quietly
But they don't believe until they leave violently Is you buying this?
Cause niggaz that purchased is under the dirt kid
They call me Drag-On; I'm the youngest but get bonkers
Collabo' wit my dogs from Yonkersbut this Bronx bomber's spittin flame
so you better wear your armorFlame on!Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)
My dogs gon' STOP, your dogs gon' DROP
And then we gon' SHUT EM DOWN, OPEN UP SHOP
First we had em like OHHH, now they like NOOO
What baby?!!  THAT'S HOW RUFF RYDERS ROLL[Jadakiss]
When I pop up, I lock shop up, pull the drop up
Park a block up, hit the alarm, put the top up
Stash the 'dro in my sock then pull my sock up
And keep the burner but if it's hot put my glock up
You know what I'm about, slidin off get my cock sucked
Or writin rhymes watching Scarface in the hot tub
Whatchu wanna bet, when I pull it out
if you don't shout that every bullet'll go in and out
Who you know besides 'Kiss take the piss in the bottle of Crist'
and then give it to a modelin bitch
And you like your watch plain, I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodline trained to find coke and bite one time[Styles]
Y'all niggaz ain't hearin me out, til I pop up
appear in your house, clearin it out, holiday style
Everybody actin violent and wild
Snatch the wife silence the child, that's how we move
Kill me my man kill you, that's how you lose
I Ruff Ryde, I don't like to slide felt that I slipped
Then the gun's only helpin the clipAnd the clip's only helpin my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin your man'When I cock back and hop out the van
Double R, get a job, play the shit in the car
Hit a party start a fight at the bar, it's natu-ral
Sell your shit for some coke and get the fuck out of Dodge[Eve]
Guess you figured that my niggaz, flippers, pullin triggers
News team crowd around, tryin to flick a picture
Get witcha, this bitch from Illadelph marches quicker
Nigga not makin sense better stay up off the liquor
Blonde bombshell, car-a-mel, heavy spender
Groups be sayin I'm they sister, hush ya mouth 'fore I hit ya
Stickin in wiseguys, fake thugs, and bullshitters
Take you for a ride, cover up your eye, then I get ya
Used to be shy-er, now I'ma Ruff Ryder
Big niggaz play me close, when they used to ride by her
Snatchin up your figures, frontin, know you dig us

Fuckin with the Dog when you fuckin with the God
Rip y'all niggaz off, faggot niggaz soft
Remember me from up North, I had you scared to cough
My name is ringin bells, in penitentiary cells
I'm making thugs rebel, ain't hard to tell
You never really wanted it, so the mic you jumped in front of it
Outta sixteen shots I'ma hit, which one of you niggaz am I gonna get
Thought you knew what I was gonna spit, this time with this rhyme
but by the end of it, y'all niggaz is gon' be like, ""Yo X ripped it!""
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop
Them cats can't be for real, I got this shit locked
Is that a game or a joke?  Say the name or get smoked
Simple as that, simple as black, to the throat
Hit em all up to the coat, now you losin your life

Yo, I used to have bad luck
Now you might see me in a Jag truck
Mad stuck either with a dime or a bad duck
Double R T with the matchin bandana
38-snub blue steel with no hammer
And I see all ya niggaz tryin to glance at the Kiss
Cuz I walk around with your whole advance on my wrist
Phonin your women, drunk off Corona's and lemon
And you know I'm still right in the main
Light in the green
I need to bug it even though I look right in the beam
Judge find out it's my team, he boost they bails
Niggaz floss on their album, try to boost their sales
We put our pies on the table when our eyes on a label
Cuz them rednecks up in the mountains will try to slay you
Call me raspy tell you what I want you to know
Fuck what you ask me you probably don't want me to blow
I got a lot of horsepower so I'm able to stick
Usually a good nigga even though I'm able to flip
You pay 30 for the 'Kiss, 100 for The L.O.X>
And if we coo', then I write a hook for a drop
Whatever's in the bank is my bet
A zebu's my pet
And get in the bed and with the legs then that
[Sheek]
Aiyyo, when my gun bust send niggaz to the fish like swamps and
New York's youngest Bumpy Johnson
I put fear in y'all heads
Sheek looks type a nigga that gasoline yall beds
And that's warning
If you all alive in the morning, that's fine
Now I suggest you hit the block and get what's rightfully mine
I want PC, see me tuck in your chains
I got niggaz my pops say that lifestyle ain't changed
It's like wake up move a brick half-of-a-slow
Make car money check with Sheek go fuck with a hoe
I rock a waste slim mink do-rag under my fittish
And I don't need rework waves, Timbs be halfway new
That Sheek in the dresser club cuz I don't fuck with shoes
And from a nigga's life, I swear to the Bible, let it be told
I put 30 in your head, all in the same hole
Cuz we all got the same goal and you tryin to tamper with mine
Don't make me mothafuckin leave you with some shit in your spine
Fuck with me, you be a was nigga
Nigga was dope
Nigga was gettin money before I extorted your coke
What, you crazy?
[Styles]
Aiyyo, catch me with a 38, box and shells
In a 98 Lincoln eatin pasta shells
Order to go, always got a box of L's
Blow, stay on the low
Get a Henney and swig
I Penuro so I hate a snake, rat, or a pig
I pop shit cuz I'm the second best, the first was B.I.G.
Y'all niggaz is shunned out, let me speak to your father
Cuz I like to play chess and I swing the revolver
If I don't like a nigga, I don't even be bothered
I spit, I'm just a crooked nigga goin legit
You hold your nine if you holdin a brick
Common sense, that drama, you hit the Bahamas, get bent
L.O.X. get respect like Sunny from Bronx Tale
Us and DMX, the Ruff Ryder cartel
Thirsty to live all y'all niggaz eager to die
I tell all my niggaz ride
You won't leave with a dime, motherfuckers
[Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah, I'm a monster
Sleep whole winters, wake up and spit summers
Ghetto nigga puttin up Will Smith numbers
Surrounded by 6's and Hummers
Bitches among us
Try not to let this bullshit become us
This started from hunger, tell it all when they sane
Now bitches notice the chains now that I've hit my number
The chickens I twisted see the digits unlisted
The beeper done change
You dead bitch, the Reaper done came
I suggest niggaz stop speakin my name
Cause trust me, y'all can still feel the heat in the rain
I keep creepin, streets keep watchin I keep poppin
Niggaz is hot heads and the bullets is heat-seekin
Jay flow pesos chase hoes NOT
I just circle around the block in a drop
Tell them to jump through the top
Where the sun roof used to be
I could see y'all not used to me
Nigga flows like none other
I'm the meanest, toughest Don Dutta, the gun butcha
You the type that bust a lot of shots and none touch ya
I'm the type that get excited when the gun touch ya
Motherfuckers

I'm headed nowhere fast run in the place gun in my waste
Niggaz wanted to taste but wouldn't come to my face
So what that mean you cats is playin games again
So what I do start namin names again(what!)
All you motherfuckers know that I speak from the heart(uh!)
Play like you dunno and L.O.X. is gonna bark
We can take it there but to make it fair, get some mo niggaz

Y'all niggaz besta stop playin
It'd be the ones you forgotten about
That'll get you shot in your mouth

God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (yes)
Like the wind blow
[DMX]
Yea, uh
From 80 school street to way across town
Cats knew how I got down cause word got around
I was that robbery kid with no gun and no mask
Catch a nigga out the door slippin' that's yo ass
Didn't laugh much cause I didn't have much
Life was like a stick half gas half clutch
Meaning half good and half bad
What was good if I caught a good vic if I didn't I was bad
Took it out on my regulars
I come through and if niggaz was broke I took watches and sneakers
Went to jail a few times but that didn't stop me
All it taught me was how not to be sloppy
An older cat robbed me when I was like 10
If anybody wanted to help they should've did it then
But they didn't and all it did was release the beast
So I'm a feast on whatever I come across in the streets
[Chorus- Janyce] (DMX)
Like the wind (like the wind)
God will take (god will take)
All my sins (all of my sins)
Blown away (will be blown away)
Like the wind (like the wind)
Like the wind (like the wind)
blooooooooooooooown
[DMX]
I had a ""S"" on my chest fuck the vest
Did robberies with some cats and robbed the rest
Other time I came thought with just me and my dog
And clear out the whole fuck block cause we when hard
I bag some niggaz I knew and some niggaz I didn't
I ain't a fuck either way it was no bullshiting
I'm a cruddy niggaz out to get money
And a couple of slugs is the only thing anybody took from me
Run up on a cat smooth like put it in his left ear
Give up the money the jewelry or get left here
Keep thinking it's a game and play let's get popped
See how much fun you having when your heart be stopped
Shut 'em down open up shop oh-oh no-oh blow off a nigga top
Somebody call the cops but it's to late
Cause I'm a hit you in the face
and what will kill you will be something that you ate
[Chorus- Janyce] (DMX)

God will take (god will take)

Blown away (will be blown away)

Blooooooooooooooown
[Jinx]
If pain is love why hide my pain with drugs
Choke off haze and sell attics coke for days
Same clothes and no soup to shave
And I still got a gun on my hip for your open grave
We used to get robbery vics
until my man got killed for his whip on some robbery shit
Then I switched to the weed and start selling crack
But I will pull a steel and put a shell up in ya back
I feel like all my life I was held up in a trap
like if I go to heaven maybe hell will want me back
But all I really want is sperwells up an a lap
And a model bitch sitting with a head in my lap
But since no doe don't spin
and my pant hole got hole within I got to fold ya men
It's obvious I live in a house of sin
I wish I could open up the door and let 'em blow at the wind

Like the wind
God will take
All my sins
Blown away
Like the wind
Like the wind

Some old born loser type of shit (shit)
On the remix tip (tip, tip)
Dr. Seuss (Seuss Seuss Suess)
[Verse 1]
The Born Loser, not because I choose to be
But because all the bad shit happens to me
I got kids, but their mothers don't want them to know me
Sisters use to like me, but now they call me homie
Use to have a family now I'm out on my own
Had to scrabble the Pitt, cause I tried to take his bone
Bitches don't like me, they don't kiss me or hug me
They call me Kill-pretty, because I'm mad ugly
I use to get pussy, but I busted off quick
Now I get snooched, so I gotta beat my dick
Time are hard in the ghetto, I steal for a living
Eatin dirt and the Now or Laters
If that ain't enough, life is rough, I swear
I don't have an address so I can't get welfare
They kicked me out the shelter
Because they said I smelled a little like the living dead
And look like helter skelter
My clothes are so funky, they bad for my health
Sometimes at night my pants go to the bathroom by their self
Even when I was little nothin went my way
I got beat up, and chased home from school every day
And despite the fact I won all the spelling bees
On my report card, I didn't get F's, I got C's
But for those who choose to snooze
Since I was born with no hope, I ain't got nothin to lose...
[Chorus:]
Young man went out and made a name for himself [3X]
Check check check it out
[Verse 2]
The Born Loser, a title I was branded with
Went to Liberty Island, and got stranded with
The Statue of Liberty, but they really didn't hafta
Leave my black ass there till the day after
No time for laughter, this shit's for real
Ribs are showin through my back, cause I ain't had a meal
In about a week, you can see bones in my hands
The racoons, beat me to the garbage cans
I'm Starvin Marvin, and it shouldn't be like that
The only thing that I'm carvin, is an alley cat
But sometimes in the daytime
I daydream of a Manwich
When all I'm really eatin is an oxygen sandwich
For those that don't know,
Thats 2 peices of bread slapped together
Or I'll have a rain sandwich, depending on the weather
Born loser, caught up in the game
And I ain't even got nobody to blame..
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The Born Loser, yeah, that use to be my ammo
When I couldn't get a soul, to listen to my demo
Door shut in my face, until I started jammin 'em
I'm behind the doors now, but I'm the one slammin 'em
I did what I had to, to get where I got
Though I'll admit, what I had to do was a lot
I still gave it a shot, and sometimes I had to shoot
Catchin vicks just to get a little loot
I thought it was cute, and didn't care who knew
Mess around get in my way and I'd bag you too
Cause I was, born to lose, straight from the beginning
Hit the dugout, because I struck out the 1st inning
Winning, was everything, thats why I had to ask
My man to find me the loot, and he said I'd be glad to
Now, who needs a major label, we got our own
I'm the divine master of the unknown
Ain't nothin changed, I'm the same as before
When opportunity knocks, I'd just answer the door
But criminal at heart, even though I don't show it
I was always a winner I just didn't know it (know it)
[Hook]

DMX the great

I'mma take it back to the shit talkin' slick talkin'
Slap a nigga and call him my bitch and keep walkin'
HALF Y'ALL niggaz is pussy
The other half of y'all niggaz is fake thugs so please don't push me
If we was in jail you'll be in the pool playin' in the air pressure
Leave you up on the stretcher nigga I'm gon test you try your hand
When they carry you out I'ma tie your man
But these cats ain't built like your killed like
Blood gets spilled like poke a nigga tonight
Bang bang HA! It hurts
The fuck you screemin' on me for I'm puttin' in work
We leave more bodies then the bloods and crips
This is how it's goin' down nigga thuggin' a bitch
Fuck a nigga wit we on the same bullshit y'all niggaz on lets get it on

You know how we roll nigga bring the noise

No matter how many cats he brought wit'um I'ma split'um
Hair raised on my back get low and hit'um
Stoped him dead in his tracks
Known damn well you ain't known me what you said in the past
Dogs don't know nothin' but bust that nigga
Dogs don't nothin' but fuck that nigga
Dogs don't know nothin' but suck my dick
When it comes to what happened dogs don't know shit
Did two years in one night
I popped two pills in one flight
Two ears in one light, aiight, aiight
That's what it is FOLLOW
Too many thick live niggaz wanna SWALLOW
Follow my mans and them
And get popped with yo mans and them is what Im handin' them
It's hot things, drop things, stop things, drop things
Lookin' like a nigga like hot wings

[Verse 3: DMX]
Been around the block did my dirt
Earl stiral put in work till it hurt
I've seen less pussy in a stripe club fuckin' with y'all niggaz
That means all y'all niggaz
Most y'all cats don't know what ruthless means
Will you be able to survive the truth I've seen
Cats would'nt be alive if you was on my team
But the truth is the ride is rough ya mean
Got me like GOD what the fuck
Dog gon bang somebodys getting' stuck
Back up the truck jump right the fuck out on niggaz
Empty the five out on niggaz
Hush muthafuckas don't you cry
Dog gon make sure that you die
Point blank range so the slug go through
Then I'ma hit yo crib and pop yo family to NIGGA!!

Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse
Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Hold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in eighty nine
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go

-I think I'm going to the top
Me and DMX
[DMX]
I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the ?
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Like the side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
when they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh

I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love, but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs
That I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill them
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood
[Mary J. Blige]
Now what's the moral to this story?
[DMX]
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from

If I don't know where I'm coming from

Gotta eat
Stepping on, my feet
Spread love, think it's sweet
Uh, uh, uh all you catz don't know
[Repeat 1]
Yeah baby, shit's about to jump off and
Lookin' for the bus to bring in my man from up north
Been like three years since when got knocked
Since he got caught
Punked up like five new blocks, holding down for it
Kept a nigga straight with money in the books
And them bitches is crooks who look out for other crooks
Took him shopping, money in his pocket is straight
Dropped him off at the wife's crib after we ate
Our estate was the next move for me
Had to make that nigga chill for at least two to three months
Cause when it's on, it's on
He didn't care
It's like slow down baby
The money ain't going nowhere
Keep in touch though and show how much your ass is with it
The dope flow is there and in a minute you can get it (come on)
You gotta watch a nigga just coming home in a game
Cause on the low we may just be trying to go against the grain
[Repeat 1 (2x)]
I never figured this nigga would pull this shit that he pulled
What is strange is the change that niggaz go through
When they're locked down and really can't hack it
A motherfucker like me handles a bid like a jacket
Strap it on my back, niggaz ain't built like me
And by the end, niggaz was like ""Yo, why you killed Mike, D""
Wasn't me, but yeah he had it coming to him
Used to be my dog, so I let my cousin do him
Sent him out of state with like half a brick down to my spot in VA
Cause the money comes quick
Half of that got fucked up before I even got the check in on him (damn)
But things happen so I really wasn't wreckin' on him (damn)
Got him up out of there and sent him down a little further
Ain't heard from him in two months, murder, murder
And from the next flight thinking I might have to steal something
This hungry shit will make a nigga wanna kill something (come on)
[Repeat 1 (2x)]
Listen, money is missing and it's hectic (what)
Found the safe, checked it
Shit looks detected (what)
Just what I expected when I got no word from him
Asked around but ain't nobody heard from him (uh-huh)
But money talks and most niggaz is snakes
So it wasn't long before his man was ready to take
Me to where he was at, checked my gat
Threw in a four clip, pumped myself up
Cause I can't go for that bullshit (come on)
Fuckin' with my last load of cash ain't the issue
It's just real fucked up when your man tries to diss you
Takin' back for niggaz in New York and how they told me so
Now I got to knock his boots, he owes me dough
Layin' up with a hoe, then he hit me with the sob story (come on)
The famous ""Oh you didn't know I got robbed!"" story (come on)
Told it's to me he should be grateful to
Fuck that bitch! Look at what she made you do
Now there's love lost and a double cross
Pointed at that bitch, turned her braids into sauce
So you wanna be with him (uh) and talk to me like I'm silly (yeah)
Five bottle of Mo on the floor, boxes of phillys (uh)
Ten g's in the shoebox under the bed
And for every g I put a fuckin' slug in his head
And from then, the moral of the story if you missed it
Is the grand is always gonna be there
Just never go against it

And get reckless
But I still know that home is home
And when I get there i'mma sit there
Take a s*** there put my d*** there
Do I handle my business?
S*** yeah
I'mma run till I bust my gun and empty the clip
Never come home, I gotta go just gimme the whip
I ain't got time for the lip
Just open the fence
Let me go I'll come back
I ain't got time to convince
Ever since I was a pup
I've been stuck with the street s***
Keep the heat s***
F*** it n**** gotta eat
I past on a weak s***
If it's out there I want it
All at one time
So when it's my time I've done it
[aaliyah]
I know you'll kill for me
You'll die you me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes
Ooh baby I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat
I barely sleep
Could you pick up a phone and call me at home?
And let me know you ain't in some heat
And don't go crying, you're grown
You know I'm looking out for you
Cause you be looking out for me, me, me
1 - [chorus]
Yo you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
?fore you go betting it all
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
I know you up in it all
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
[aaliyah](dmx)
And oh boy I know you got to do what you do, ooh-ooh
You're making moves, I'm makin? moves yo we cool
(what? what? what? )
Lay on your paws I got your back if you fall, hey-hey
Nothing's to big, nothing's to small just go ball, yeah
[dmx]
Uh dog tags around my neck the streets are mine
I might leave the heat behind
Cause in the streets I'm fine
That's why n***** sleep till nine
Out by ten back by ten
Sleep till nine do it again
If you love something let it go
If it comes back to you it yours
If it doesn't f*** it you'll never know
You got me I got you, uh
Dog with a dog, ride till we die
If it's on then it's on
Repeat 1 till end

When I Come thru Everything gon' Stop
When I Come thru Everything gon' Stop
When I Come thru Everything gon' Stop
Now move.. move.. move.. move..
[DMX]
X comes thru the hood, like here comes trouble
Year of the dog again, first week double
Low in the rider, east coast nigga
Fo' in the rider, street loc nigga
Far for jiggie but like biggie bitches call me big poppa
I got a big dick and I'd a pop her
Yea the kid talk shit but the kid don't front
How ever shit go ""Give 'Em What They Want""
I ain't signing shit, love my fans
But Cross this line with the camera in your hands
Cause it could get real ugly real thick
And you like this nigga ???? real quick
Motherfuckin' right, I ain't got time for the small talk
One of us has got to go down, we can't all walk
You know this as well as I do
But I promise you, I'm go hide you and no one will find you
[Chorus] (Swizz Beatz)
[Busta Rhymes]
Stop nigga, hold up, you know I don't quit
You see I'm back and I'm comin' to smash your shit
And ahhla back with the god and bus-a-bus nigga
This time I'm Bringin' the shovel so I can come and dig another grave
For all of you bustards what the fuck you think you doin'
I'll put a stop to your function and anybody movin'
And then I'll fuck up production and any crew you flew in
You ain't with me, you against me, The loser side you chosen
Anyway, word to ears, you niggaz know I ain't finished
I'll Fuck up every hood, and I'm back to handle my business
You niggaz thinking you though like you ate a can of spinach
In till we mash on you faggots and make you change up your image
Flip mode in this bitch, Ruff Ryders is with me
You see we back on the block and yes, we runnin' the city
Now you niggaz know the flow less ain't controlin' the committee
Nothing' should be movin' unless my crew in it, you fell me
[Chorus] (Swizz Beatz)
[DMX]
If there is money, I want half
Niggaz is funny to watch, go head laugh
Ain't nothing to smile about
For real, all niggaz is wildin' out
Niggaz who pound you out
We found you out in distance
Leg missin', head missin'
Something like 28 ??? missin'
And you know how the dessert do a nigga
Brake you down quick, residue a nigga
Can't stop the flow, Niggaz stop and go
When ever I drop, a million out the door
Y'all niggaz know, X got to be fucked with
Y'all run around on some dumb shit with a slump dick
Fuck a bitch, you niggaz know I don't mind scrapping
When I see you I see you what ever happens, happens
This ain't just rappin', niggaz talk a good one
You know what let that go, see me in the hood son

Places that I've have been, things that I have seen
What you call a nightmare, are what I have as dreams
Bad as that may seem, I know is only going to get worse
Love, a slug, which one am I gonna get first?
My journey's been a rough one, I'm not sure when it begins
But the way it's looking, I kind of know when it's gonna end
Hold me down baby, it's gonna be a rough ride
Niggas give us plenty of room, cause I guess enough died
Let me travel, cause my intentions are to travel in peace
Fuck around I lay you down, you hit the gravel and cease
I could be a beast, or I could be a gentleman
But if you ain't my dog, you gonna be like 'Oh, it's him again'
Niggas will never win, this whole rap game is mine
Hot as you ever been, I was that in eighty nine
Seek and you shall find, look within and you will know
Where you coming from, and where you gotta go
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from
Where would I go?
-I think I'm going to the top
Me and DMX
[DMX]
I will spend mad time in one spot, plotting my next move
Trying to figure out what is it, that X do what X do
Some questions go unanswered, that's what I'm afraid of
Sometimes I can't show, but I know what I'm made of
They made love, or should I say they made lust
Bound, there didn't have to be love there, but they made us
I got quite a few sisters, I was the only boy
But being with my dog, was my only joy
Like a kid with a new toy, I forgot about the ?
Escaped the misery, didn't think about the crime
Lost all track of time, was in another world
Everybody knew Earl, but there was another Earl
Like the side of the dark, riding the park but wouldn't want to
when they jump me, became a good runner
One by one they all went under, so I had the last laugh
They all thought it all was a joke, but I had the last laugh

I feel the ghost from within, coming back to haunt me
Stay love in my peoples, even though they don't want me
When I was bad, I was forgotten, like I was dead and rotten
Should've been getting love, but instead was plotting
Shit wasn't right, and it was all blamed on me
Didn't know that I was special till this rap shit came to be
Gave me a way out, showed me it was better to teach
Than bust niggas with the fo-fo, leave them dead in the streets
Over beef that was worth less, than the cost of the slugs
That I bought to kill them
And that's because I thought I ought to kill them
Little did I know, death wasn't right
Didn't always show every breath was a life
It was to be captured in suspended animation
To be felt by all, understood by every nation
What's the sense of hating, when I can show love
What's the sense of faking, when I can show blood
[Mary J. Blige]
Now what's the moral to this story?
[DMX]
Come on!

If I don't know where I'm coming from

Yo, ayo let's get papers and pop mo? with holes up in skyscrapers
In condiminiums, overlooking our drug capers
New york city, know only way to play is gritty
I want cheddar, so we can front up in the 850
My whole commity like to puff l's and look jiggy
Who wan? test this? my semi leave you chestless
And ain't shit that you can say to me when you be breathless
Young, but I done did shit that you won't do
So go ahead wit the bullshit you blab about goin through
I got niggaz who pump on yo? block and in yo? spot
Who sit next to you? protectin you?
But they'll murder you, playa
Don status, nigga we gettin chipsesis
And bad bitchsesis, frontin, frontin in eclipsesis
[mase]
Ayo, mase and the lox
We takin knots from the out of state spots
Any nigga make it hot, get found in vacant lot
You don't really wanna come try, the one guy
Who stay dumb high from blunt lye
The rack of sing-sing alumni
Who got more beef than a islamic farm
So I pack enough sonic arms to neutralize atomic bombs
It's not a nigga in your gang want it
My ak slay gays, spray strays wit niggaz names on it
Often I bug, then we'll soften a thug
Have a chump coughin blood, fill his coffin with slugs
Yo, you know I got enough guns to wreck a nation
Any nigga wave a tec at mase, and, have a explanation
You bring your crew and em and I'm doin em
Then I'm beatin em down with aluminum
Then I'm puttin two in em
You can't touch me, I've been double sent, wanted for embezzlement
A lot of other things, but that's irrelavent

Yo, check out the kid that get coke like sosa
Never turned down chocha, be in the costa
Rica, sippin margaritas wit a mami
Cleanin my tommy, showin love to my army
Whenever the lox find rippy blocks, we kill em
Yeah I hear niggaz, but I still don't feel em
And this for the listeners, and prisoners
And them jealous rap cats that prefer dissin us
My 16's be so real, you can feel em in your vain
Like ramello's pops from sugarhill
J be the cause for the kiss at your wake
Cartel lips, spittin clips at your face
We started from the bottom
You'll see bad niggaz pardon, whatever
We can do it at the garden
Word life, this shit is real big
I'm makin niggaz blow trial even if they not guilty
[styles]
I want a palace for my thugs, wit oriental rugs
Green bags from drugs, get wacked for the love
Twenty niggaz batter me, still couldn't shatter me
I'm only gettin up, splittin up your anatomy
Official lock family, grants niggaz handin me
I want the finer things, and I hope you understandin me
Sittin at the table, plannin and plug the fan in
Let the sweat dry off and then grab your cannon
Think you smartest, and retaliate the hardest, regardless
If you a thug or a rap artist, respect me like pesci
And if rap was hockey, I be gretzky, puffin nestle
Any ya niggaz done started somethin
Actin invincible like you God or somethin
If you god, then i'ma makes a lot til you rot
And if you a playa, then play for everything you got
And if you a thug, then start bustin off shots
And if you a dog, you better bite before you bark

Don't came at me wit no bullshit, use caution
Cause when I wet shit, I dead shit, like abortions
For bigger portions, of extortion then racketeering
Got niggaz fearin, fuck whatchu heard, this whatchu hearin
How much darker must it get, how much harder must it hit
See if your hardest niggaz flip, when I start a bunch of shit
I like pussy, but not up in my face, so gimme three feet
Cause when we creep, no more than three deep, niggaz see sheep
Bloodhounds found your shit buried in the mud
Following traces of gun powder, residue and blood
A positive I'd is impossible, so you know
John doe is what they gon? be puttin on that tag on yo? toe
Now who gon tell yo mother, her baby's under a cover in the morgue
Stiff as a log, sniffed out by the dogs
Son of a hard headed nigga that wouldn't listen
So you got whatchu came for

What's that?

Surgery wit the chainsaw grrrrr, I hit the fuckin streets
Cause like I said before ain't nothin goin down until I eat
Mu'fuckers think it's all about impressin bitches and stressin bitches
Well, I'm testin bitches game, adressin bitches, and caressin bitches
And dealin wit mu'fuckers on all levels
What I'm dealin wit is all devils, fuckin with snakes
Runnin wit niggaz you call rebels
I got an army of 730 niggaz, dirty niggaz
That come through and worry niggaz
30 niggaz that like to bury niggaz
And scary niggaz get it all the time
Cause what they got is all of mine

Streets help niggaz; niggaz don't help the streets
Y'all use beats for help; we help the beats

Be in the hood with all your jewels in the glovebox

Raised in the wrong era, with no guidance

Let us pray
Lord Jesus it is you, who wakes me up every day
And I am forever grateful for your love...
...this is why I pray
You let me touch so many people, and it's all for the good
I influenced so many children, I never thought that I would
And I couldn't take credit for the love they get
because it all comes from you lord
I'm just the one that's givin it
And when it seems like the pressure gets to be too much
I take time out and pray, and ask that you be my crutch
Lord I am not perfect by a longshot -- I confess to you daily
But I work harder everyday, and I hope that you hear me
In my heart I mean well, but if you'll help me to grow
then what I have in my heart, will begin to show
And when I get goin, I'm not looking back for NOTHING
Cause I'll know where I'm heeded, cause I'm so tired of the sufferin
I stand before you, a weakend version of, your reflection
Begin for direction, for my soul needs resurrection
I don't deserve what you've given me, but you never took it from me
because I'm grateful, and I use it, and I do not, worship money
If what you want from me is to bring your children to you
My regret is only having one life to do it, instead of two
Amen

Uh
Sick when she rock shit, stop when block shit
Never try to run when she pull back the cock shit
Stop, drop, shut 'em down open up shop shit
Got 'em goin' crazy, wonderin' when they could cop shit
First lady, Ruff Ryder, honey got the hot shit
Star-bound, money now, for jet-black drop shit
Eve guarantee, betcha' niggaz wanna pop this
Little kids be behind me screamin' out, ""Can you stop miss?!!""
I know they daddy's fiendin', daydreamin' bout me topless
Real bitches listen while they ride around and knock my shit
Try not to move ya head, come on now, stop it
Hustle nigga betty take yours quicker than coke profit
'Cuz I can double it, and put
Bitch on bitch, brick on brick, stich on stich, who you fuckin wit?
Not me, can't a nigga or bitch stop me
You hatin' mothafuckas line up for your first copy
[Chorus]
[Nokio]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, ""WHOA!!WHOA!!""
[Eve]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz that take ones?
'Cuz when we smoke that shit it's like ""WHOA!!WHOA!!""
[Verse 2: Eve]
Uh, yo
Start the beef, hold up, ran when we roled up
Tough guy, wanna try ya luck? Betcha' fold up
Ask around partner, got this whole shit sewed up
Gotcha' cryin' like, ""Man I wanna blow up!!""
Cowards make me sick, swere to god I wanna throw-up
Answer in a session with me? You better flow tough
Offended? Don't agree with what i'm sayin' nigga? So what?
Now I gotta teach you respect, you better slow up
Question, 'Can she really hold it down?' (sure enough)
Philly's where she from, but when she smoke, she like to go Dutch
You know what? Quick to take the next man shyne
Quick to make him start bitchin' make the next man whine
Fuckin babies!! Go ahead and lay down, it's nap-time
Same shit you spittin', heard it in your last rhyme
Ain't to much thatchu' could do, so that'chure skills could pass mine
Car eer fineto, here's some dough, go watch a peep show
[Chorus]
[Nokio]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz with the big guns?

[Verse 3: Eve]
What me to talk crazy, shit, my moms made me
And all ya'll niggas can do is *???spend a paybie???*
Ain't gonna never change, do anything for bricks
Call my celly to come get you while I pass you in your Range
Nigga ride ya shotgun in the car wit' your friends
And what the fuck you wanna do? But wanna blow out your brains?
Clown, I spot 'em from the time you buy me a drink
Instantly I get a vision of diamond studded links, and full ink minks
And little doggies dyed pink
'Cuz I know ya wanna spend your last, before you even think
If you know somethin', speak the shit, I can keep a secret
To me, the niggas with the most money, is the cheapest
Wanna give me money off the book? Daddy you can keep it
That's why they got the most sites, and in the most fights
And walk with big brolic niggas thats protectin' they life
If you know you pussy nigga, take off the ice
[Chorus]
[Nokio]
Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH
Where my niggaz with the big guns?
And when you smoke that shit it's like, ""WHOA!!WHOA!!""

Y'all fuckin' with the right ones, UHH
Role it up and just lite some, UHH

Yeah, check it out, y'all
Check it out, check it out
Check it out y'all, check it out y'all
Straight Y.O. mother fuckers
Now days cats and middleman, little man, ain't controlling shit
Talk about holding bricks, but ain't holding dick
Niggas talk real slick, but that's about it
Soon as I see 'em headed my way, I cut them off quick
Must you beat me in my head everytime I come through
It's shit like, everybody tells me I sound just like you
But you got me, got me And you can't live without me
If I wasn't DMX, you wouldn't give a fuck about me
Ain't about ""Dog I wanna be just like you""
How about you wanting to be just like you
You can do what I do, just in your own way
Shit, I get niggas that ride big every fuckin' day (I-ight)
If you got talent, talent is yours, it can't be mine
And it take you where it's gon' take you, it'll be fine
Let me hit 'em with the rewind
Do you and I'll do me
To me you'll see how real you'll be
[1] - Do you - Cuz what it boils down to it's true
Do you - Cuz you are held accountable for you
Do you - Is that really what you want me to see
Do you - Cuz I'mma do me, truley

Hey yo dog, I got lyrics
Hey yo dog, I got beats (Word)
Damn, is this the type of shit I gots to put up with in the streets
Used to be able to walk, not have to talk to nobody
Everywhere I go it's like I bring the whole party
It ain't about tryin' to follow or tryin' to be like
But if we all see it through the eyes of the Lord, we see a light (c'mon)
Just let me get a hold of the mic, I'll teach you a little something
Now the good things that go wrong because of a little frontin'
Express yourselves, be who you are, umm umm, you're a shining star
You don't even know what you got inside
How the fuck you gon' find out, you keep wanting to ride
Hey yo, I ain't gon' let it slide no more
You're best to go for what you know
Can't do you, then what you flow for
You ain't gon' get there tryin' to be me, dog
Look through your eyes, see what you see
[Repeat 1]
Like fuck it, you wanna be me Here's what you do
Grow up neglected by both parents and still pull through
You gots to come up fucked up, get treated like shit
Then have your mother's new boyfriend smack you like a bitch Turn into a killer,
don't carry shottie
Cuz the way it's goin' down right now, you gon' kill somebody
Get a dog, walk the streets, learn what you need to learn
Better have a cause but because you'll get burned
You got 15 years without ever coming out
And beat your fist at the world and what they talkin' about
Then get locked up every two years
For two years keep it real, hold back all tears, face your fears
Become a man before your time, rap but live out your rhymes
Let 'em know what's on your mind, then you'll get your shine
In time, everything you hear will come true
But you won't be doin' me, you'll be doin' you

Strickly for the ladies (One more time)
Hey, that's all this is
Uh uh (Uh uh)
[DMX]
She was five seven one twenty-five
Man, loose lips with those thighs (Uh)
Couldn't just let her walk by (right), I ain't a thirsty nigga
But right about now my throat was gettin real dry
Shoo this shit, had to be the cutest bitch
I seen in a long time and I don't do this shit, like
Runnin up on hoes, what up ma, I'm X
Cause you know how this goes, come on ma, I'm X
We just chill, sat and talk to the first light
And for the first time I didn't fuck on the first night
And it was aight, shorty was a thorobred
Like ""Belly"", we ain't fuck, she just gave me head, for real
[Chorus]
(Janice)
From the time that the sun is up
Till the stars show up
It really doesn't matter to me
It doesn't matter babe
There's no love like the dog love
There's no love, it's dog love
(Amerie)
No matter what, I'll hold you down
Nobody else will come around
Don't even matter cause
There's no love like the dog love
I got my dog love, got my dog love baby
(There's no love, it's dog love)

I run with shorty, pass off the gun to shorty
Do whatever gots to be done with shorty, straight like that
When I hit her like ""I'll be right back""
Yo, I'll be right back, ain't no bullshittin, I'll be right back
She got a nigga catchin feelings, I'm a street nigga hard body
But, she got me catchin feelings
Man, those eyes, those lips
Be like damn, those thighs, those hips
She like ""blam"", make a nigga have to touch somethin (For real)
Not necessarily fuck somethin, as long as I touch somethin (For real)
A nigga blood boil when I see another nigga holla (WHAT)
Don't make me have to pop a nigga in his fuckin collar

Aiyyo, shit is goin to smooth (Uh)
Since Stella got a new groove (Yeah) it's like we got somethin to prove
We gon' make it, rain or shine
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Like Eve said, ""Love Is Blind"" (Come on), right about now
I can't see shit cause you always on my mind
Been like that, since I met her, had to have her so I went to get her
But I'm a dog so I didn't sweat her
And it wasn't bout the cheddar, I don't trick
I got two things for bitches, couple of jokes and some dick
Yeah the kid talk slick but that's not what I'm about
We got dog love and me and shorty ridin it out, we out

All I want is you in my life

Red with a sheet, over the corpse
Shit is deep, so I shed a tear, over the loss
If you creep, then you niggaz'll roll with the force
Shoulda paid that money that you owed to the boss

Uh-huh
Don't do it dog, it's just not worth it
Please heh, for your sake, hehehe

(This goes out to the general public)
Yo.. you over there Styles? - Yeah dog
(Anybody sleepin on us)
Second album nigga - two guns up nigga
Real L.O.X. - blaze!
""We Are the Streets"" nigga, y'all know who the best
(C'mon) Fuck y'all niggas wanna do - what, what?
(Let's go)
[Verse One]
Couldn't live the life I live (yo why's that)
I could die any minute, I get high every minute
Fuckin with snake niggas, and sleepin with foul bitches
Came through in the latest whip with two pounds in it
Pull over where the hustlers be (and why's that)
Cause I get chills when you talk of hustlin ki's
So I'm always where the powder be at (what it mean)
I can blow five bricks to ten in an hour if that
Stay away from where the cowards be at (why's that)
Time is money god, and you can't get an hour back
Or I would do it again to get the power back
Have Godfather status, make niggas bow to that
You could all shine and glitter and keep the ones
Fives and tens, for twenties and up, we dummy it up
Make a lot of money, look bummy and what
Cause money aint shit, respect is everything
So if I kill niggas dead, don't ask me shit
I smoke blunts to the head, so don't pass me shit
I'd rather die from a bullet, than a nasty bitch
They say the good die young, all that mean to me
is that the hood die young, we call it the last days
What you know about coppin a house to fight pits in
Or blowin weed smoke on the cops that write tickets
Henny iy up, shit we can semi it up
Have a picture of you on the wall, 'In Memory Of'
Stay in sync with the hood, gray minks with the hood
We tryin' to get money like chinks in the hood
They ask me how I'm doing now - I tell 'em better than them
And if your man front - he can get eleven in him
And if you told them once - then you better tell him again
Ay yo, now let's see
Who you know fuckin with Sheek Luc, Jadakiss, and S.P.
[Chorus: The L.O.X.]
From dope money to rap money, back to dope money (C'mon)
From loaded guns to empty ones, over dope money (Let's go)
We got the car house and the smoke, with the dope money (C'mon)
All my niggas that died, over dope money (Let's go)
Bust your nine niggas, side by side niggas (C'mon)
If we get the RICO law, we go run and hide niggas (Let's go)
Death is the only thing that might divide niggas (C'mon)
So don't fuck around with them Ryde or Die niggas (Let's go)
[Verse Two]
Basically speakin, all I know your face will be leakin
I rap full time and still pump bass on the weekend
A nigga hoppin all over the map - and what you learned
That niggas with long paper take longer to crack
That's why every chance I buy me a gat
Why you rather buy you a chain - I aim at your brain
Nigga, robbery is all we know, so how we gon go broke
when we could always take all y'all dough
And then fly out to Cuba and get in the coke fields
Die off the buddha, fifty with fifty mill
Bring drama cause Gianconna got Kennedy killed
If you come through in a jet, then you frontin to us
Cause when the coke price was up - it was nuthin to us
We got blocks full of heroin - weed and dust
Seen bullets pop off - cause of greed and lust
And when the big dogs die - who gon feed the pups
My niggas is here, so you know the circle is tight
I circle the block, and cut off the lights - pray to Christ
And when the cops come, we don't care, we got shotguns
And niggas with the most ice, get the hot ones
Stay on your job, nigga I'ma stay on mine
And if I lose my voice nigga, I'ma flow online
And by next year, we should have a thousand guns
Nigga Ruff Ryde, Ryde or Die Volume One

It's big dog baby
Gettin down like what
See I'm a thorough bread
I don't fuck wit much
Bloodline is
Where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ
Yea what black
Don't nothin move less
Dog say so
Cats clueless
About the way it go
Off the chain I got
At least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill
Cuz they feel dog
I can't help what it is
Shit is real dog
You must have thought that
It was a joke or somethin
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin
Now hold up playa
Cuz I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit
Cuz I don't say no names
See what I know I'm taking
To the fuckin grave
So keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin thing
[Chorus x4]
Ay yo
Who we be was off the last joint
But now it's who we see
And we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before coochie rapper talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin me
Cuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on
Another batch is born
Don't give a fuck
Bout none of y'all
Fuck each and every one of y'all

Been where ya at
Been where ya goin
Then brought it back
I tried to tell ya bout it
But you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood
Cuz the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened
Cuz then you woulda known
That it's only right
To give a dog a bone
Bitch
[Chorus x2]
Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand
When a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
In to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast
That's the lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door
Shhh chill
You sit right there
I'm gonna answer that
Cuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back

Uh-huh (Y'KNOW)
ARF!
Uhh..
Take it for what it's worth, my birth was a blessing
Sent to live and die, on earth as a lesson
We each have a star, all we have to do is find it
Once you do, everyone who sees it will be blinded (WHAT)
They'll tell you that you're bright, and say you have a future
When you turn your back, same cats'll try to shoot ya
Niggaz ain't shit, I can live on both sides of the fence
Forget what you do, when you talk, see what you really meant (aight)
That's what I thought, them niggaz was bluffin (uh)
They talk all day but say, nothin (uh)
It gets so dark (WHAT) haze so intense
Since this first rain it's like it's rained ever since (WHAT)
Never got paid for a rhyme but I flow (whoo)
Never got a plate on time but I grow (whoo)
Live your life, STAY on the line but I go (UHH)
Went from doin crime to bein kind cause I know
[Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)]
I'm gon' live forever, I'm never gon' die
Only thing I fear is that I'm never gon' fly
Carry my weight but I'm never gon' cry
Shit I tell y'all niggaz straight cause I'm never gon' lie

What is about who I am that makes me unforgettable (HMM)
What it is about what I've done that makes it so incredible (uhh)
""More money, more problems"" -- well the fame was worse (uh-huh)
I reached out for love and what came back was thirst (WHAT)
Blessed with the curse (uh) niggaz don't hear me
Niggaz don't hear me, Y'ALL NIGGAZ, don't hear me (uh)
What'd I just say ""Nigga g'head"" - you see that
You gots to FEEL ME to catch what I'm sayin, BELIEVE THAT (UHH!)
But leave that, alone (WHAT)
We gon' make a nigga wanna be at, your home (WHAT)
Oh you kinda quiet with the heat at, your dome (UHH!)
If the dog got he's gonna bring back a bone
cause we got the chrome (C'MON!)

What you niggaz wanna lie for It changes nothin
I'm true for cats, yet some strangers bluffin

Now if I take what he gave me and I, use it right (uh-huh)
In other words if I listen and, use the light (uh-huh)
Then what I say will remain here, after I'm gone
Still here, on the strength of a song, I live on (HMM)
No second-guessin on what I stood for, I was good for
stoppin niggaz from killin each other in the hood war (UHH)
Comin through showin love, throwin up (UHH)

Dark Man baby, that's my name

Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war

One thing we must remember that life is all hood
And the casket's all wood, and we all take it there one day
Shit today is Sunday, we both could be there on Monday
Life is bullied like that, WHAT'Thugged the fuck out
Sometimes I take it to the church and sometimes thug the fuck out
Niggaz get drunk the fuck out their boots, violating family rules

Mighty please come and get it before I kill shorty
I will do for my niggaz as what they will do for me
Bust a faggot like you for free

You could get yourself caught up in shit you can't handle

Two days later he's dressed up, let him rest up
He ain't going nowhere, no time soon

break you in half, fake niggas make me laugh

And ain't got none, get the shotgun cause you hungry

Think when you die, how many's gonna miss you
Lean over in your casket and kiss you
Send you on your way with a blessing
And pray that another learned a lesson

'Gave it to him full blast', nah dog just a little
Besides rap, I don't talk, but make plenty of moves
I'll murder ten of you fools, before your ready to choose
You either win or you lose, and I 'luh' to win
Even if it means I got to shed blood again
Keep a bank account doubling but don't hate me

I'm part of the meek, started to speak, at age 10
Other kids were ridin' bikes, but that was the age when
I became a man, learned to stand, on my own
One dog, no bone, so young, so grown
Kid left home, shit got harder, kid got smarter
Did my part of the bad shit, I was the starter
Came from the heart of the hood, not lookin' too good
Fuckin' did what I could; ready to bitch in the wood
For all the shit you do, just when you think you sly
What goes around, comes around, the wrong damn time
Maybe too late, but damn, I shoulda did that back then
Shoulda thought about that then, now come on out the den
Slowly, Come on; keep your hands where I can see ‘em

The more you think your slick, but somebody sees everything
Sometimes the thieves never hang

How to be left standin' alone
Get a nigga gone, that aint right
Do it yourself, be a man and fight
Nigga earn your stripes, I damn sure earned mine
I already know your language, now try to learn mine

Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it
[Busta Rhymes:]
Y'all niggas try to front, I'll send my crew on a hunt
Bunch of scheming ass niggas smoking gats and blunts
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode represent
For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz
And we gonna be here to present
Y'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street
And block the fuck out, bang the fuckin' floor with your feet
Before we bang y'all niggas all with the heat
Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials
[Chorus]
[Swizz Beats:]
Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips
Y'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck y'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here
[Chorus: 3x]
New York, they ain't ready for it
A-T-L, they ain't ready for it
Oh, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it
Whoa, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it
My ladies
Millenium
Guns bustin' plenty of them, y'all hear that

Ay yo fuck y'all niggaz
(Man fuck you too)
Ay yo fuck y'all niggaz
(Man fuck you too)
It's big dog baby
Gettin down like what
See I'm a thorough bread
I don't fuck wit much
Bloodline is
Where the pups at
They off the Grand Champ
Yea what black
Don't nothin move less
Dog say so
Cats clueless
About the way it go
Off the chain I got
At least 3 kills
Even though my last album only did 3 mil
I still give em chill
Cuz they feel dog
I can't help what it is
Shit is real dog
You must have thought that
It was a joke or somethin
Now you done fucked around
And got your man choked for frontin
Now hold up playa
Cuz I don't play those games
And don't ask me shit
Cuz I don't say no names
See what I know I'm taking
To the fuckin grave
So keep knockin cuz you ain't gettin a fuckin thing
[Chorus x4]
Ay yo
Who we be was off the last joint
But now it's who we see
And we forget the last joint
Cats ain't never walked like X
Even before coochie rapper talked like sex
I've been around since at least 83
So ain't no sense in you motherfuckers hatin me
Cuz I'm gon be here when you cats is gone
And other cats is on
Another batch is born
Don't give a fuck
Bout none of y'all
Fuck each and every one of y'all
Cuz I done done it all
Been where ya at

Then brought it back
I tried to tell ya bout it
But you wouldn't listen
Now I'm gonna take you to the hood
Cuz the hood will listen
I wish you woulda listened
Cuz then you woulda known
That it's only right
To give a dog a bone
Bitch
[Chorus x2]
Aw Man
There are some things I can't stand
When a nigga holla wanna shake my left hand
When a nigga follow cuz he actin like my man
Nigga might as well swallow cuz he actin like a fan
And I got balls like you do
Man I got paul to pull through you
Stan don't they know how we do
In to the streets with our hearts to the people
Gots to give a little to get somethin back
And what you usually give see you ain't nothin black
But when you don't give then it won't last
His shit will disappear like wit a nigga that smoked fast
You'll get broke fast
That's the lord's will
Hold up I think somebody's a the door
Shhh chill
You sit right there
I'm gonna answer that
Cuz when I finish poppin ain't nobody answerin back

Fuck it

Yo what am I, an animal

One bad mooley, and you can get pants, schooly
I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke
Think I started on the choir singin solo for the pope
Tell your mama please, get up off her knees
You can't wear yellow spandex wit a ass of cottage cheese
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens
Toes *Kriss Krossed* like she on J. Dupris' team
Button your sittin up like beach balls in the sand plus
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired
Now I'm lookin for some washed up rapper that I can hire
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that wrong
For so glowin, afro pickin
S-curl hatin, Jamaican rum sippin

Kid I'll burp on your girl buttcheeks

The honey had my nuts like two red beets
I'm banannas, out of my fuckin mind they won't let me back in
Cuz I was down before the hype like Dusty Rhodes and Bob Backlund

Transportin out, the poison in 'em
Box 'em up in the aisle with the frozen dinners
[Method Man]
And them niggas that ran...
[Redman]
My goal's to get 'em
With the heat seekin flow wit, fo' antennas
Doc's Da Name, that's why y'all fuck wit me

If you can't pick that afro, I'm gon bust you
Walkin like you was a lil nigga cuz you is
And don't forget that daddy's gonna always love his kids
Crackin niggas got the nerve to wonder why I rob, why
You guys will live while everybody else'll starve

Wit' the hollows
Crack the safe grab the bottles

Caught me in the shoulder, the neck, the ear

What! Niggaz can't fuck with us
DMX:
Get at me dog. My niggaz
Styles:
That's my word!
Verse One: DMX
I'm the type to kick back and look at shit,
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know, will get you locked in sleep away camp.
Grand champ and raise more hell, than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole, bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggaz stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like ""What's that oooh""
What's that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggaz toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggaz thinking they shitty, what a pity
Lemme show them niggaz shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal
Verse Two: Styles
Y'all niggaz fucking with the L.O.X.
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggaz wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggaz get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggaz don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggaz come through then we lock it
(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)
Verse Three: Jadakiss
With no glocks I'm in your town with five locks
Take five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots
It's the L.O.X, three niggaz that listen and watch
And nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot
It be that new flow, my niggaz, fly niggaz
Always high niggaz, ready to die niggaz
As far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing
Lemme get the one clearance like a sample
'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped
Left somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp
Niggaz is done, since poppy raised his son
When bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums
Whether you can flow or not ain't the issue
You don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle
Take a puff then a swig
Think about how I'm gonna
hold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig
Your money is low, and your flow been late
While I be coming through with new shit with tint plates
The only higher than money, is respect
The only thing hotter than my click, is a tek
So when I hit you with these last bars around your neck
You gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga
(WHAT, YEAH)
Verse Four: Sheek Luchion
My bank account be doubling
While you niggaz stay in trouble and
L.O.X. stay fly
Three niggaz jig-I
Shit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law
Kingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular
It's Sheek baby
Chicks hate to see me on the Soul Train
With Don Cornelius
And all they got is alias
To work with
To catch Sheek, y'all niggaz besta work quick
Now that I'm eating right, plus living well
So nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell
Ain't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan
With a black master full 850 full suspension
While you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years
My stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce
Small black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama
Keep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product
I learn things, just by watching y'all niggaz make the wrong moves
Now I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools
Y'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit
Cats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it
P.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B.
Your shit be so-so, low pro.
On a bus before the cars show
On some old joystick shit, no mirrors
I can see behind me through the cameras
Flip plates, make the whole block go bananas

[Verse - DMX]
Once again it's the darker nigga
Hit or spark a nigga, break apart a nigga
But the dog is bigger, under stress
So unless you're wanting to bless to the chest
These slugs from his liver rest REST!
Or the pump'll put a hurt on a nigga
DUMB SEX, motherfucker feeding dirt on a nigga
My hands stay dirty, cause I play dirty the mob way
You don't know? fuck it find out the hard
A nigga's job is never done
I handle my business how it come
And there's never been a one on one
Nor has there been a problem, I dissolve them
I'm like salt, lock it up
Hate to fall but never wreck his car
And it's my fault, keep niggaz on point ducking down
Niggaz like you need to get bust you fucking clown
I extort to support my peeps
And hold down the fort, never get caught cause I creeps NIGGA!
[Chorus]
[Verse - DMX]
I'm at the crossroads, look but I'm not really sure which way to go
Should I play that low for what I did the other day
They on their way to float, got me striking this random
I can't stand em, fake ass niggaz want to be the Phantom
Looking over my shoulder, cause it's colder than it was
And start shorty, because I'm a little older than cuz
And the buzz from the saw, wit the chain to your brain
Will turn that BIG NIGGA to a fucking stain
That pain from the dirt makes the hurt go away for a minute
But I'm gon die by it cause I'm like knee deep in it
And you motherfuckers wonder why I start shit
Cause when you look in my face you see that hard shit
Cause I done been to hell and back I ain't wit selling crack
I'd rather rob a nigga leave him wit a shell up in his back
On the real just to show proof, hit the G.W.B.
And blow the whole roof off the toll booth bitch ass nigga!
[Chorus]
[Verse - DMX]
When I crawl, leave a nigga sprawled out after I spoke em
I'll slit his throat, dick in the mud and let his blood choke em
Up north niggaz get the pick stuck up in em
And in the streets bitches get the dick stuck up in em
My M.O. is man-slaughter kid
Cause on the reals I done wet up more motherfuckers than water did
Slid, cause I got to slide when the dirt is done
A homicide but they want me on the Murder 1
But as long as I got my gun, I'm aight
Stay outta sight while it's light, and then come out at night
To make moves again, stomp and bruise again
I know I'm going to hell cause I choose to sin
All my motherfucking life I been the Devil's advocate
Now niggaz never even knew the devil had a kid
But he does and when you hear the buzz of the chainsaw
You'll know what I'll split your motherfucking brains for
[Chorus - repeat 2x]
[Outro - Swizz Beatz]
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
You wanna start something, it's gon be somethin
You wanna start something, it's gon be somethin
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
Don't start nothing, it won't be nothing
You wanna start something, it's gon be somethin
You wanna start something, it's gon be somethin

You cats, talk slick but walk quick when the dog hit
The dog hits coming back to the raw shit
Aww shit they done let me back out the gate

Back off the chains so please back out the way

Don't give a fuck what a nigga say no matter who he sound like

shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down

keep a couple of niggaz with me that'll bang you down
now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
my New York niggaz leave y'all wit razor bumps
now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac

Grrrrrrr.
Gettin down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once, the, Line's, crossed - BAZAAR!
[Verse One: Bazaar Royale - singing]
I am from the ghet-to
I don't do the dis-co
I just pull my pis-tol
Take a chunk of your soul
It's me who ride up by you
Police won't recognize you
Run up right behind you
To let my ratchet squeeze
And you don't want no drama
Pistol-whip your momma
Put that bitch in trauma
You don't wanna war with MEEEEEEE!!
[Chorus: DMX]
Gettin down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once, the, Line's, crossed
Gettin down for what we stand for cause it don't stop
Once, the, Line's, crossed
[Verse Two: Big Stan] + (DMX)
(Next out the gate is B.S.!)
Dog, I don't have to use the fifth to be a threat
I stand 6'3"", 430, any less?
Motherfuckers want they shit split, I ain't the one to test
Understand what I'm sayin if NOT, how I figure
Nine to your tongue while I play with the trigger
Will make you understand what I say a lot quicker
Do we have an understanding? (YEAH!) My nigga
In case I be frontin know they really - DON'T WANT IT WITH MEEEE
Come comin with them hollows and heaters - TO PUT IT SIMPLYYYY
So if your team don't follow its leader - THEN COME AND GET MEEEE
But ALL you cowards better believe it - YOU COMIN WITH MEEEE!
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Kashmir] + (DMX)
(Next out the gate that bitch Kash!)
Dog, I'm known for gettin up in these niggaz ASS!
And they don't wanna, fuck with the bitch of this shit
Cause I position the hits
Speak with the nine, niggaz ain't ready for that shit that I spit
OH NO - get at these niggaz for SHO'
Cause once you cross the Line you already, know we get DOUGH
Dog, the quicker they slip, the quicker they ready
Holes in your Pelle, body laid up in the back of the deli
I thought, y'all already knew about me and these triggers
Get touched if you ever fuck with, me and these niggaz
The bitch is loose, got niggaz like, ""Bitch you loose!""
I'm the realest bitch of them all cause I get down for what I stand for
[Chorus]
[Verse Four: DMX]
.. YO!!
Fuck I gots to say it for?  You already KNOW!
I was goin dizzy, I get busy with the FLOW!
Oh, it's like that?  Aight, AIYYO!
Niggaz comin through anytime, any-WHERE!
Pop up and pop niggaz up RIGHT THERE!
Put yo' man's brains in the motherfuckin AIR!
Pop pop pop, you drop drop drop.. stoppin
Look at, what I done to you niggaz
I don't wanna be your father, TIRED of sonnin you niggaz
And I'm sick of bein bothered, I'm confrontin you niggaz
And take this and run, in a minute, I'm huntin you niggaz
Go on now!

Ruff Ryder Nigga, Volume 2
We show niggas the meaning of ryde or die
So all that bullshit you talking, go head nigga
[Jadakiss]
You don't gotta slap me five or give me a hug
And it hurts when you gotta kill a nigga you love
But I'm gone deal wit my enemies sooner
Cause I got'em looking for my solo album like Kennedy Jr.
Fuck crush ice, go head and get your shine on
I'm bout to cop rocks that y'all niggas can climb on
Don't worry bout why I ain't got mine on
I want some new shit, I don't want nothing that you can tell time on
Things ain't all good right now
Cause some more niggas die an turn all you in the hood right now
Y'all can stop acting like that nigga J gone squeeze
Cause all I got is misdeameanors and some ACD's
Y'all gon make me lay something down I promise
And Puff wear scarmas and listen to Carl Thomas
Puff running and hide and we coping more guns
An we coming outside cause somebody gotta die
[Chorus]
Go head you know we getting plenty of Dough
Go head you know we lighting plenty of dro
Go head you know we coming from Y-O
Go head truly though Go head really though
Go Head you know we hitting plenty of hos
Go head you know we ripping plenty of shows
Go head you know we coming from Y-O
Go head truly though Go head really though
[Sheek]
Now I warned y'all niggas that Sheek was the one
Now I'm warning y'all niggas that I got my gun
Read to kill, don't worry bout no doctor bill
It ain't gone be one of those just yo casket clothes
Lox, nah you rather fuck wit the cops
Cause I pop and turn y'all like the optimum box
No paper feud, it's straight hate wit dude
So I'm hungry and let the morgue zip up your crew
you wanna hope on our dicks and go whilly yo bikes
And wear Ruff Ryder tees, motherfucker please
You a poke-a-nose nigga, want you stick to the skis
And I don't hear a nigga raps no more
So I don't bother to go in the store an cop y'all shit
Only time I cop y'all shit if Lox on it
I shoot you in yo mouth ain't no calling the cops
I want my shit back like cash flo and Elian's pop
[Chorus]
[Styles]
I'm always that, I'm always this
But the floor stay nasty like hallway piss
If you here the P spitting it's a deep ass song
When I die mama bury me wit street clothes on
Cause drama be the threapy, the beef goes on
should've been speaking out of it makes it a lot
But I was fucking wit the savages, kicking the drop
Live for the money, die for my niggas, run from the law
Catch me smoking my weed or fucking your whore
Push my whip to the limit kind of hoping it flip
Throw my clip to the tip kind of hoping you flip
I feel sorry for the crackheads, but happy for myself
So I got mixed feelings about this hussling shit
I keep saying I'm gone quit after a couple of bricks
But I can't stop building and I don't pop children
But I got no problem kidnapping a bitch

I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, til I see, what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep, in the dirt
Permanently, you just being hurt, this ain't gonna work
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cuz we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speakin? wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin?, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster beat on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely, I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon? know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phoney
Come on, bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!

On purpose, to hurt your focus,

You'se not them G's, you'se a circus,

You'se curtains, you use words,
cool heard, slurred in two thousand third
You'se purpin?, you'se no threat, who's ya servin?
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze,
and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You'se not the streets, you'se the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the debt

Die, motherfucker, die!
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes

Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life

Cuz it's all good, it's all right

Tryin to get you, to spend the whole night with me

Couldn't treat her like a hoodrat, didn't bite her
Turn a church girl to a straight Ruff Ryder
Take her to the Ramada make it an all nighter

Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine

Must have the stacks to cross lines

Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue

Got my own crib so you can't kick me out

Ain't no love here, just slugs here Kids know the half you get plugged here,
that's just impossible for the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me Throwin rocks from the penalty box,
cop a plea Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse,

Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us but,
dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live to get revenge,
and we ride to the end Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's and only five in,
the Belly of the beast Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street

Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggaz that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggaz that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on That's D
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you

Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer

Ain't no love here, just slugs here, kids know the half, you get plugged here
That's just impossile, for the weak to last, now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin' you, watchin' me
Throwin' rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young g, we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely, and ride for me
Cuz we family, for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, and each year, I'm pourin' out some beer
For deceased peers, holdin' fort
Police line, do not cross, they found his corpse
In the loft, wit the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide, the crime method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the grand finale
[Nas]
Hot corners, cops wit warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, gettin' bent, lick a poem
My dog, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
in the stomach, he robbin niggaz who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those?  Go and see
shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
but, dogs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
to get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
and only five in, the Belly of the beast Didn't wanna hear the shit
I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh
[Chorus: Vita]
If it ain't rough, it aint' me
Down for dice, is what you told me
If it ain't rough, it ain't me
See, chick from the other side, grand finale
[Vita]
My dogs for life, call for life, now who be the job like fuck Totti
Slim weight, petite, body, down for my niggas, quick to pull a shotty
Sprayin' everybody, lacin' the whole party
Holdin' wall when my niggas hung, wit I rush
Like boys that I do know, it's me I trust
Now watch how I tie bust, guarantee I be sittin' down
Waitin' to hear up, wit the blast
Got you niggas snitchin' weed in my stash, high flow
Over the bitch who knows to stash weed
Cold for you bitches who try to oppose me
Hot Totti, same chick in Belly
Ooh, if it ain't it ain't me
[DMX]
Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggaz that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggaz that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on?  That's D
The dog come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
one more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over!  This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

Yeah, thats how you do that
And he had such a good head up on his shoulders, but I blew that
Fuck you black, you new cats don't know somethin important
You die quick fuckin with my shit, and my shits extortin
House rules, when I speak, y'all niggas listen
I drop jewels that y'all cats can't afford to keep missin
Drinkin ??? fueled by drugs
Shits about to get real outta hand dog, betta get ya man dog
Rap shit comes second, I'ma show you what a robber do

Uh, uh, uh
Dog it ain't no secret 'bout how its going down once I put on the pressure
It ain't nothing but another nigga put on a stretcher
With a blanket over his face, take him to the morgue with the waste
'Cuz he was in the wrong place at the wrong time
So I gave it to him in his chest
In his throat, in his head, in his back, through his vest, YES
Ain't a whole lot to braking a nigga down fast
They call me black 'cuz thats how I'm gon' be on that ass
Y'all pussy niggas think y'all sweet
But ain't a fuckin thing going down til I eat
So can I beef? You betta while you still got teeth
'Cuz they about to get knocked out, hopped out
On that ass with a blast that'll make ya shit drop out
Popped out, through a you know what
Cuz you know why, and you know my

And bitch, you know I

You heard it from the P, you oughta know it's the truth
I get you kidnapped and raped and thrown off a roof
You could nod your head to this like it's only a rap
Cuz when these bullets hit your ass I'm like it's only a gat
I need a funeral to feel good, I'm hopin it's yours
Think you delicious, heard he got shot in the cross
Holiday Styles, bitch I broke most of the laws
Fuck with the poor, so flip to the boots, stick to the truth
Do anything it takes just to give it a slue
And missin a tooth, but both of 'em chipped, toaster is gripped
You heard about the trouble, I start most of the shit
When I squeeze aint no controllin the wrist
And niggas leave the room when the hear the P blowin his whis
I'm an ignorant and negative nigga
I sell crack, bust guns, pop shit, and say I'm better than niggas
You think not, I'll look at your man and level a nigga
If you think a rapper's better why don't you give me his name
So I can run up on him, tear him up and give you his frame
When it comes to the streets, I'm the nigga to call
Five eight and three quarters, but I'm bigger than y'all
If I left the gun home, I'ma give you the sword
I'm the devil in the flesh, I can't give you the Lord
It don't make no sense for you to pray for your life
I got my niggas in the crib, you oughta pray for your wife

Get shot, die in his arm, and give him my last
It's a million dollar bail, I'ma get it in cash
I sell crack like it's '88, I live in the past
You know the P carry the gun, live in the mask
Tell niggas show me the money and gimme the stash
I like malibu and pineapple, fifty's of hash
Hundred's of dro, wear my clothes a week in a row
Sleep on the floor, catch me right next to the dog
I'm Holiday Styles, and that's what the weaponry for
And I probably won't blow for the fact that I'm hard
But I'm good with ten million in the back of the car
Either that or get life and lift the rack in the yard
Gettin jewels from the old timers, stashin the cards
But jail aint part of the plans
I keep weight on the scale cuz I feel I get further with grams
In my last few bars, I run through niggas like my last few cars
And crash 'em up, the boy mighta went platinum but don't gas him up
I get his length and his width and get his casket cut
I don't deal with the snakes and fakes
But I deal with the comas and wakes, I don't make mistakes
Double R now bitch you oughta know I'ma ghost
Blow up your face, blow up the coke, and blow up the smoke

Coming through, like I do, you know

Knew she was a thug because when I met her she had a scarf on
54/11 size 7 in girls
Babyface, would look like she was 11 with curls
Girlfriend,(what?) remember me, from way back, I'm the same cat
With the wave cap the motherfucker that TNT used to blaze at
Still here, so it's all good
Oh you know my niggaz Rich and them doing they thing on 35th Ave
It's a small hood, and it's all wood, so let me get that number
Hook it up, aight
Hit you on da track later on, see wassup

I'da kept it more than real boo, can't lose with me
Heard he smacked you 'cuz you said my name while y'all was sexin'
Ran up on this cat, thought was me, and started flexin'
You know I ain't even with that
So he gon' have to get that just on tv
Try to creep me, what? Leave that nigga sleepy
On the strength of you, that's your kid's daddy
I ain't gon' send him on his way, put him up in that big caddy

Sometimes, sometimes you just know, you just know, that's all
Hook:
(I can feel it comin' in the air tonight, hold onnnn
I've been waitin for this moment for all my life
hold onnn, hold onnnnnn)
The best of y'all niggas remind me of myself when I was younger
When it was hunger that stopped the nigga from goin' under
And you wonder, why I pat you on your head, smile
Look in your eyes and thank the lord for my child
Meanwhile, somethin' I gotta show you an I hope you can take it
Gonna leave you in the desert, an I hope that you make it
Gotta put you on your ass to see what it does to you
When you stand up an see that I'm just showin' love to you
Other niggas would put a slug through you, over your ends
Caps I fucked with are real, but hey
Those are your friends
Its just what you got comin' sometimes you don't know
What you askin' for, did you ask for more?
Should the casket door swing here, it is done
An thought you was a killer, you swore you'd never run
Nigga died with his gun still up in the holster
It is comin' in the air? Yeah its getting' closer
Hook
I see life through many shades of grays and blacks
I could take that an him 'em with the blazin' tracks
When I make that you fake cats have violent dreams
Takes another dog to be able to hear my silent screams
The devil got a hold on me an he won't let go
I can feel the lord pullin' but he movin' dead slow
Let 'em know that amidst all this confusion
some of us may do the winnin'
But we all do the losin' its just who does the choosin'
Easy goin up or down what have you been provin'?
Jus that you were fuckin' ground
Bitch seen the bullshit, but never spoke on it
An I know that deep down you really don't want it
I woulda traded the chance of bein' the child with a father
Movin' talent and bein' able to survive when its harder
My balance on the high beams of life, keep my dreams in strife
That's why I hit these motherfuckin' streets at night
Come on!
Hook
There's a lotta shit that I let slide, cuz its outta my hands
Lotta niggas I let ride, but its not in my plans
An a lot of my mans is not seein' through the fog
Families by the truckload, feedin' them to the morgue
Full moon, arooooo, the howlin', errrrrrr
an growlin', shhhhhh, an prowlin'
Don't know love, can't show love
That means you gonna need more love
than on old thug, but hold up, roll up
Talkin' out the side of your mouth is
what's gonna is what's gonna let niggas know
Why you bad in your house, an they lie up to your spouse
Told her it was suicide, but you an I
Both knew the truth, for we'd never die
Listen nigga, if you scared, get a dog, but be prepared, for the mob
Cuz you dead up in the fog, an that's your head by the log
I can smell it in the air, I can tell when its there
This is hell an we both here
Can you feel it? Tell me yeah

I be, I be that dog that gots to flow
That's why, that's why baby I gots to blow
And you, and you know it's straight from the gutter
Because, because it's gettin darker than a mother
Slow down, slow down partner you movin too quick
Oh now, oh now gotcha, your crew and them sick
What now, what now nigga, you feelin this shit
But how, but how is this nigga killin this shit
Don't think, don't think that it couldn't happen again
Don't blink, don't blink cuz I put a () in your chin
Then what, then what niggas is gonna see you dead
For what, for what over some shit a bitch said
But why, but why did your life mean so liitle

Good thing, good thing I knew what was on your mind

No bail, no bail cuz they don't believe your story
Oh well, oh well guess you gon do that forty

lyrics are:
[DMX]
I know that my savior lives
And at the end, he will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed, yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see him for myself - and I long for that moment
Grandma, I really miss you and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I, hear yo' name
Mary Ella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't - it's like when you left, you took the Lord witchu
Why couldn't I come when he came to get you?
Damn I really miss you - I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like ten
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein hard headed
You told me I would get it - you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw, that it hurt you, more than it hurt me
I thought - how bad could this hurt be? I know now
That's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
[DMX]
What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'ma let you know what's been goin on lately
Now you know since you left, a lot of things witcho kids done changed
Yeah Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renee's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's doin real good now, she workin
Rhonda's still runnin around, trickin, jerkin
Buckeye's buggin, he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father.. well, that's somethin else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring
[Chorus]
[DMX]
You left behind a mother (and) eleven kids (and) eleven grandkids
And since then, two of yo' grandkids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother, that's right
Xavier's means you a great grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her, accepted and lovin my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my - life, I thank you for the bible
I thank you for the songs that you sing in the mornin
(Amazing Grace..) while I'm yawnin
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line
the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to heaven to see you again - amen
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
[Faith Evans]
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see, yeahhh

And I'm the teacher

Dyme enters chorus after first verse
First I'm gonna crawl, uh (crawl)
Then I'm gonna walk, uh huh (walk)
Then I'm gonna stand, uh huh (stand)
Then I'm gonna talk, uh (talk)
Then I gotta learn, what (learn)
In order to teach, (teach)
Then I gotta burn (burn)
In order to reach (reach), my niggas
[Verse 1]
Yo, I see what I see, day by day
Hopin that the Lord can, pave my way
Have I been forgotten, have I forsaken
Or maybe I'm just wrong with the moves that I've been makin
Hatin others cuz they hate me, over envy
Wanna send me, when we used to be friendly
Think I started off on top With multi platinum albums
Naw dog, I started off on the block
I just did shit to get shit
Niggas always knew I was down to hit shit
That's why I stay wit shit
Played with shit, but it wasn't a game
First time locked down, wasn't the same
A whole new world, nothin but close to steel
Niggas gettin split for real, miss a good deal
They aint call nobody, cuz don't nobody care
They got my back against the wall, fuck it I'm just here
[CHORUS 2X]
[Verse 2]
Dog it's like this, when the fog is type thick
A nigga might flip, and a nigga bite quick
But I stay focused on what's important
Supportin my family, fuckin with my dogs and reportin
According to the man upstairs, we all got our own problems
So why the fuck you worryin about theirs
It was a long time ago, look awake, cuz he'll leave you
I hear none, speak none, see none, evil
All I can do is teach you, what I know
How I flow, how I get down, where I go
Maybe what I been through, will send you
Somewhere, other then where, dreams all out the window
I love my people, all of my people
And God gon keep me callin my people
You gots to live life to the fullest
It aint always about the size of the gun, sometimes it's the bullet
[CHORUS 2X]
[Verse 3]
Every day we live and learn, take it step by step
And we create our own path, until there's no life left
I hold my death, off for as long as I can
Knowin my man, is plottin with the chrome in his hand
Supposed to be fam, but niggas get shady over money
My nigga, pull out the 380 over money
Crazy over money, can't do without it
I got other shit to deal with, I'm like forget about it
It's the one I don't know but must teach that comes first
Because he comes with the thirst of a nigga that tatted the worst
It's like a curse that's to be lifted, he was there but he gripped it
Got a call and he shifted, once he found out he was gifted
Gotta kick it from the heart, and I hope you got it
It was there from the start, I just hope you spot it
Cuz it's my blood on paper, my soul on paper
Words to live by will leave a hole in the paper

Got em trickin while they suckin, give em dick and they be BUGGIN
I've done it all - from mackin two hoes on a three-way
Dominican hoes on B-way, country hoes in V-A
And they all say the same about my game it's tight
That's why every night a different group of bitches start a fight
over some dick that they don't even own
All I'm givin them is the bone
Blowin up a niggaz phone, but ain't nobody home (damn)
I'm in the zone, tryin to do things

Pictures of bitches and flicks of chicks
Videos with the baddest hoes, suckin dick
It's the dog in me, that makes me do wrong
And honies can't help but get strung (why?)
Cause the game is too strong (okay)
I like em greedy, black like Edi
Eyes beady, willin to give to the needy
I done ran through em all, from around the way bitches
to them outta state hoes, and even hittin gay bitches
All I tell em is, 'Let me get that,' then it's on
Knock her motherfuckin boots, and then I'm gone
I got the white bitches sayin, 'It's a black thing!'
Cause I leave that hoe with no dough and plenty of back pain

Bitches who get props, cause they know who can get got
And they can get shot, by the way a niggaz lip drop
Walk up in the spot, knowin what she want strictly

Hits me, pays me, doesn't get crazy
Knows to be Swayze, cause that's daddy's baby
I keep them hoes in check, like the government
Hittin em off with nuttin BUT THE DICK, and they lovin it!
Huggin it, like it's they best friend, cause it is

Got em committin they first crimes

It's like I see through the eyes of a wise old man
So I chill, and when I can kill this guy's whole fam
Something better to be thought dumb and remain silent
Then to open your mouth and remove () cuz if it came violent
See I'm gonna give it to you straight, so you don't ask anymore
You don't really want what you asking me for
It's a war (ugh), when it's on it's on, when I'm long (what)
Till I'm gone and I ain't got long
But while I'm here, (ugh) ya'll niggaz gonna burn
Be () after this money (what) and ya'll niggaz gonna learn
All this fucking weak you've been talking about that driveby
And they did nothing but driveby's
Listen shorty I'm telling you this for your own good
(Uhh) Everybody is the man in they own hood, for real
[Chorus x4]
Yeah cuz if it's on it's on
Bitch niggas keep frontin' then your ass is gone!!
[2nd Verse]
I always keep my enemies the closest (uhh)
Always make sure I know where the toast is (uhh)
Always cover my tracks when I creep
Always get away when I'm done to relax to D
I always know the rules of the game before I play
And always keep enough dough to know I'm good for the day
Always walk my dogs off the leash and
Always get my thoughts off the streets and
Always will ever lend a hand in borrow
And always no matter what plan for tomorrow
I always pay my respects to the dead
I always take at least one blunt to the head
Now always know -- (cut off) is gonna end up getting fucked
And always know-- (cut off) is gonna end up getting stuck!
I'm always strapped; I'm always cracked
I've always rapped; it's always that
Always black
[Chorus x4]
[3rd Verse]
Never try to knock off rock on the block that ain't yours
Never take a man's life cuz you hate yours
Never become so involved with something that it blinds you
Never forget where you from someone who reminds you
Never take for granted what's been given as a gift
And if I sleep on -- (cut off) left that nigga stiff
Never turn your back on -- you don't trust
Never turn your gat on -- and don't bust
Never expect to give away with cent -- more than twice
Never forget you could get it too for a price
Never bring a two and -- if you scared to die
Never gonna do it -- if you scared to drive
Never gonna be another day it gets dark
Never get it -- here for the heart
Never say never, cuz I never thought, this never thought never
Ever caught better, getting cheddar, with doing better, Dmx!
[Chorus x4]
Uhh Dmx

Ya'll niggaz don't know, how it's gonna go, For real (uhh!)
It's Dark & Hell is Hot

Verse 1:
Sold the crack when I was down in AC
Back on the block Jay-Z mother fucker from the, the, the Roc
Went solo on that ass but it's still the same
Brooklyn be the place where I serve them thangs
Be my niggas was struggling, to the 'burbs they came
And then we got to hustling, mudering thangs
I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain
Now I'm Titianic, Iceberg's the name
Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game
The best way to describe me in the word, insane
I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame
Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain
The God, send you back to the earth from which you came
I'm baking soda, waterfire, merged with 'cane
Ladies don't know me said ""I heard he's vain""
Well guess what mommies? I heard the same,
You heard the name

Verse 2:
Got a license to kill so I stay the gat
Roc-a-fella, Ruff Ryders, nigga scared a that
Got a new motto this year, Don't Fuck With My Ones
Knock on your door, three in the morning, ""It's just us and our guns!""
See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns
got the mind capacity of a young Butch Cassidy
Niggas get fly, let 'em defy gravity
Four-five rapidly lift your chest cavity
Streets won't let me chill
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill
Mother fuckers wanna wet me still,
I remain ya'll Raw, the one, like five divided by four
Shit, this just the hate that's been provided by ya'll
Reciprocated and multiplied by more
You likely to see Jigga in a Wide Body or
Drop-top Bently is all, Holla at me ya'll

Verse 3:
I don't give a fuck if I sold one or one million, but I think you should
Cause if I only sold one, then out comes the hood
The all black, in the gloves, the outcome ain't good
Them niggas act like wolves, how come? They could
Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash
Till the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass
All I gotta do is let 'em call me Shawn de'Glass
Let me sit up in they whip till I launch it back
Snap they neck, then shoot 'em till they aren't sent back
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back
Monster's back, and Flex drop a bomb to that
And everybody sing-a-long to the track, Come on

What y'all want me to do
Keep your shit the hardest
It's about to go down
Niggaz is ready to start this war that's for sure
Nigga come and get it
Ride and die why
Cause my niggaz is wit it
I want Monopoly money but I ain't even half way there
Do a dirt and a nigga gotta take the backway there
What it is is the biz and its dirty
You'll get rich but life expectancy is about thirty
Take the business to the hallways, driving up for four days
On parole with warrants that'll send me back the raw way
If I get caught across Jersey state lines
Figure this 98 and I been runnin since 89
So that's like 9 years delinquent time
You speakin crime than you know
9 years you owe it's not 9 years you gonna go
No probation or parole more time doin nothin
They roam to yard writin rhymes an frontin
Carry niggaz greasy because I'm built like that
Burry niggaz easy cause they get kilt like that
If you ain't in it wit me than you in my way
But either or you will respect mine
And leave tech 9 and leave it for dude
The realest you gonna feel is when you face your death
Sorry I didn't know nigga don't even waste your breath
Coppin pleas not D why you flippin
Nigga know the only thing I'm really scared of is slippin
Letin a nigga catch you when I got my gaurd down
So I keep em up
Noddin of with one eye open
I can it freak but theres a time when i'm close 'em both
Lead poisonin i'm a get hit with an overdose
So I don't drug thing crud thangs
Think I don't know a slug stains, or blood blaze
Raw gun playin drama
Sadness to another niggaz momma
I'm a be the the one that puts you up inside the trauma
These are troublesome times
And the crime prevails
And the dark side keeps a niggaz ass in jail
Bada-boom-bada-bing some of this and some of that
Gotta boogie for a minute but you know i'm coming back
Chorus(2x)
Try to show niggaz but I can only hope they see
You a little nigga fit right up in a 6 by 3
Layin' up like this
Lips sewn shut eyes closed
Niggas walk past the casket damn shorty nice pose
You was ballin nigga till your ass got balled out
Called out by some disrespectful ass niggas that go all out
I bet you thought it was real funny
Until it had to get cruddy
Me walkin off leavnin you with all this bloody
What he gonna do when it's all over for real
And the last thing you see is that steel
A blast of light that's what he seein' if you blast him right
Hit him in the face and hear that closed casket tight
Get it right it aint nothin but endin it to a nigga
Street sweeper like ahhhh!
Sendin it to a nigga
When you in the house you play by house
2 words you'll never here again are house lose
And that's house choose it aint gonna be that
Cause I can't see that
Ready to get in them niggaz ass real good so where the weed at
Believe that you aint going to see nothin to familiar
I would tell you what to do but than I'd have to kill you
And it ain't even worth it I ain't goin to build nothin
So I'm just gonna let you go be that same nigga
still frontin laughin and shit
Like you see somethin funny but you say sound good
let me see somethin money
For real

They tryin-they comin' for my head po (uh)
They're tryin' to put pressure on a nigga
Huh, short notice (uh-huh)
Got sumpin' for them niggaz though (uh-huh)
Yo
[Verse 1]
I'm like the Dow Jones of rap, my stocks is high
And it never was all of, so stop the lies
Mothafuckas'll blow your brains out, and watch you bleed
The same niggaz that you trust, let 'em watch your seed
You got a dead niggaz, money don't stop the greed
That's why now I gotta rock my vest, pop my 3
And whoever die first, may god forgive
the nigga who lives, sometimes you gotta handle your biz
To my niggaz when I die, keep inhalin' the lye
And come to my wake high, when your tellin' me bye
What goes around comes around, am I comin' or goin'?
All i'm tryin' to do is leave you numb, gunnin' or flowin'
I might cock-back the gauge, and start shootin' at 'cha people
I'm lookin for the devil 'cuz money's the root of evil
And 'Kiss won't be happy 'til my bezel look see-thru
Until I flood N-Y with pediquo and diesle
Catch me with the top, off my whip
Bust my gun while it's still tucked so you could hop, off my dick
I run with a few parolees, all thieves, that rocks ice
Blue pacholies and rolies
At the mob meetin', keep quite when the God speakin'
Squeeze my joint, 'til my mothafuckin' palm squeakin'
And nevermind who the lox'll sign to (that's right)
What difference do it make nigga?
Just listen to the tape nigga (c'mon)
[Chorus]
Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ryde or die (uh)
Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry (uh-huh)
Jay to the mmwwaa, keep cowards on their toes (yeah)
Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes (uh)
Jay to the mmwwaa got the smash on the block (uh-huh)
Kiss got the label's tellin' niggaz not to drop (tell 'em)
Everthing you get (uh-huh), you really don't expect (naw)
'Cuz when you Jay to the mmwwaa, you kiss to the death
[Verse 2]
Yeah, Yo, Yo
I wanna know, is the promise land heaven or hell?
'Cuz the niggaz that made promises, most of them fell
If you hungry, then I got some niggaz servin' the shells
With no sauce, and they silver, only take one to kill you
It's a small world, so you better guard your secrets
And it's easy to get money, but it's hard to keep it
Never was the one that like to hound no bitch
All I do is try to keep niggaz around me rich
Screw all-a-y'all cowards, I consider you lames
Had to save my lunch money just to get in the game
That was back when I used-ta have a mean back-spin
And no mack-10, it was just bats then
U know, beat a nigga down, take his rope
Now we-a, heat a nigga down, take his coke
And you can call me if you wanna bye them thangs
I get 'em half-price 'cuz papi know my name
Call me, Jay to the mmwwaa
And everything you got in your livin room, I got in my car
'Cept for the bar
I try to put a little money away
'Cuz you know they say, tommorrow ain't promised today
Either bubblin' or strugglin', nuttin between
Or have a grimie nigga like me, fuckin' ya Queen
And the Kiss only do shit with niggaz I know (that's right)
And the outside nigga can't fuck up my flow (c'mon)
[Chorus]
Jay to the mmwwaa, hustle coke, ryde or die
Kiss hand-wash money, let it drip dry
Jay to the mmwwaa, keep cowards on their toes
Kiss push the drop, rock the ice, get the hoes
Jay to the mmwwaa got the smash on the block
Kiss got the label's tellin' niggaz not to drop
Everthing you get, you really don't expect

I'll tell you why I can
come on!

I'm gonna go hard
whether I'm right or wrong
till the dead and gone
it's on!
what ya'll really want?!
bring it on
I'ma let life be my song
[Repeat Chorus]
[DMX]
How I live is simple
walk through the streets
talk to the beats
New York! I'ma eat
I never had a problem with surviving
no problem with getting down, busting my guns, or ruff rydin'
cats talk slick but I talk slicker
my shits for real cause I'm that nigga
the reason that you hurtin' is you gotta take your problems
straight to the lord, no body else can solve them(?)
see what I see but look through my eyes
the devil is a liar the truth never lies
we all got issues
shit that we go thru
shit that we been thru
shit that we wont do
the pain that we bring upon ourself
for no reason, is the worst!
that's why I say I'm blessed with the curse
the Lord gave it all to me
and in the process, I lost my soul
damn! the devil got a hold
in my mind, I'm like a little boy
lost in crime
like the healthy nigga that the devil forced into dying
the lord knows I'm trying
but at the same time
you hear the nigga with the weight of the world!
why you gave it to Earl?
[CHORUS]
to live is to suffer
and i'm living it up
face everyday chin up
I ain't giving it up
cause if I aint giving a fuck
the who will?!
so I hope for the best
knowing that its all uphill
sometimes I wonder what's lifes about
sometimes I wonder why I take the wrong route
then turn around and go out
and no doubt, the fate in mine is blind
so whatever, fuck it, I'ma roll out
we all go through the motions
we get different notions
we each have our own ocean
that we can either drown or float
like the vessels that we are
vessels that would carry many far
dont know what to say, when you talking
dont know who you gone see, when you walking
if you dont know how much of what you do is dirt
3 things you dont know gonna get you hurt!
Nigga!

You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that i wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penatentary, sending me letters i answer back
That eventually, we all be bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast ,nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say i did the right thing

You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Payin doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best

No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga

It's two o'clock and I'm just about to hit the street
Til I knock off this rock I don't get to eat
Sometimes that's like that's the only reason why I hustle
Step on toes, strongarm and show a lil' muscle
Ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feel so frustrated
I hate it, seein crab niggaz that made it
And I'm robbin cats just as broke as myself
Livin foul and ain't lookin out for my health, where's the wealth
Not in New York, cause niggaz talk about goin out of state
Money got an eighth, comin back, hot with a lot of weight
Where's my plate nigga I'm hungry too
So I'ma do like hungry do, and get a hungry crew
Niggaz that ain't never had, and doin bad
Won't be bad to get up off that stoop lookin sad

Gots to take a block and make it boom

The purple top thirty-five smalls a ring of games
but I'ma crush him with the black 40 double-L's
I send two niggaz back up top, and come back
we chop up rock, by midnight, we open up shop
It's four in the mornin, we on the block creepin
Killin the cash, while yo' ass is sleepin
Look here, I'm what they call a true hustler
cause nigga if I ain't know you since I was like six
then I don't trust ya
And we'll bust ya over somethin petty like a few dollars
Put somethin hot up in that ass and watch you holla (""Ahhhhh!"")
You think I'm here for the hoe flow I want the dough flow
and fuck the po'-po', nigga keep a fo'-fo'

I spend my money on niggaz cause niggaz get me rich
and a bitch ain't doin shit but suckin my dick
Niggaz is family now, and we stand strong
Thirty niggaz on six blocks, makin the cash long
Shit is good, because niggaz gettin what they been wantin
and we see the same shit, other New York niggaz frontin
Stick up kids huntin, but I ain't got no love for em
I keep the burner and the duster with the glove for em
Them motherfuckin knockers come at us and chop us
and I know they, really tryin to stop us and wanna drop us
So we pump, from the alley and the last house we use as a cash house
It's holdin em strong, it's a stash house
I got runners that work for twelve hour shifts
and when them niggaz keep they count correct, I don't riff
But I ain't tryin to hear that nigga took your pack shit
Ain't tryin to hear jack shit, fuck the black bitch
I ain't a greedy nigga, all I want is a five year run
If I don't make it, then fuck it, let me die near a gun
Got bitches to transport without an escort
I'm makin moves from D.C. up to Westport
Local police ain't a problem cause they don't even stress us
It be them ATF niggaz that have you under pressure
Just so you know, ain't gon' never put my glock down (why nigga)
Cause I'm a hustlin motherfucker, and I'm holdin my block down

I know that my savior lives
And at the end, he will stand on this earth
My flesh may be destroyed, yet from this body, I will see God
Yes, I will see him for myself - and I long for that moment
Grandma, I really miss you and it ain't been the same
I drop a tear when I, hear yo' name
Mariella Holloway, why you gotta be so far away?
Used to say, ""Don't worry, it's gon' be okay""
But it ain't - it's like when you left, you took the Lord witchu
Why couldn't I come when he came to get you?
Damn I really miss you - I had to say it again
I remember the time when I was like ten
Crept up in the neighbor's yard, yeah, bein hard headed
You told me I would get it - you said it!
And boy did I get it, but after you spanked me, you hugged me
Kissed me on my forehead, told me that you love me
And I saw, that it hurt you, more than it hurt me
I thought - how bad could this hurt be? I know now
That's why it's only done out of love
What I wouldn't give for one mo' hug, from grandma
[Chorus: Faith Evans]
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
Baby it's gon' be okay (she used to tell me that)
Baby it's gon' be okay (I really miss hearin)
[DMX]
What I'm about to say a couple of family members is gon' hate me
But I'ma let you know what's been goin on lately
Now you know since you left, a lot of things witcho kids done changed
Yeah Jackie's still crazy, don't know what's up with James
Ain't seen Jerry in a while, you know he walk like you
And Renee's back in jail, you know she talk like you
Riculah's(?) doin real good now, she workin
Rhonda's still runnin around, trickin, jerkin
Buckeye's buggin, he done lost his mind
And Jarvis? Back out of jail, doin fine
Kylie? He done changed, it ain't all about self
As for my father.. well, that's somethin else
But that's my dog, he hold his grandmother down
My great grandmother, makin a lot of trips out of town
But that's a good thing, and if I could only hear you sing
once more, oh Lord, the comfort it would bring
[Chorus]
[DMX]
You left behind a mother (and) eleven kids (and) eleven grandkids
And since then, two of yo' grandkids done had kids
They had a boy named Tacoma, Xavier's brother, that's right
Xavier's means you a great grandmother
I thank you for the best times of my life
I thank you for when you first met her, accepted and lovin my wife
I thank you for those Sunday dinners, they were vital
I thank you for my - life, I thank you for the bible
I thank you for the songs that you sing in the mornin
(Amazing Grace..) while I'm yawnin
I thank you for the two beatings you gave me
Cause I know somewhere along the line
the lesson I learned from the two beatings saved me
And when you died I cried like a baby, I begged the Lord to take me
Cause no one else could give me what you gave me
But life like everything comes to an end
I pray I go to heaven to see you again - amen
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
[Faith Evans]
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see, yeahhh

We gonna send a lot and pray to Christ forgive us

Ever since Snoop came through and crushed the buildings

Talk greasy I think they found em down the road or something
Fuckin wit a madman in a bad mood
Its like fuckin wit a mad dog that wasnt fed food
And the only thing thats stoppin him is you
Cause the only thing that he'll be droppin is you
Topic include; choppin in two
Drop it to Clue and the response from the street
This was one dog that loves raw meat
But gettin back to just cause I, love my niggaz
I shed blood, for my niggaz
Let a nigga holler where my niggaz
All I'ma hear is right here my nigga

What you think is gonna happen
with three of the illest niggas together
Street music and so fourth on one track,huh
Can't be serious, it's murda nigga, huh, it's Murda
Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Why would you fuck with me
Knowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha
Cock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal
And promise you only one thing, to not miss you
Jahova know the god that served ya
Cause dead or alive when I arrive it's Murda
[Ja:]
Shit I hope ya'll niggas know to lay low now
Cause thou shall perish if you don't bow down
Cause I hit em on sight, its dark dim the lights
You shot twice god bless to this the night
That alot of niggas fear the coming of their life
And you dead right be in hell looking for ice
Fuckin with Ja you bitch niggas talking shit
All on my dick you broke niggas making me rich
You gonna blaze me cause you high ripped off the henne rock
Flow semi-hot handling me your not
Check my forte not even on a bad day you beat this
Rather beat your dick or your bitch
My flow be the sick shit, pray again
Niggas dying cause they know I spit like iron, nothing but bark flyin
Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight, It's alright
I let the world know I shine like ice
I bet it all I can throw a hard four in the dice
Cause I'm a gambling man, you should gamble with a gat in your hand
Spin in barrel and put it to your head
Cause we don't dance no more all we do is cock and spit
Dedicated to giving you nothing but thug shit
Think we playing, you undoubtable fall further
Fuckin with I N C is Murda
[DMX:]
I'm a crudy nigga, goin raw-dogin dirty bitches
And if I give birth I'm giving that shit to thirty bitches
You say you know a nigga like me, guess again Poppy
I might smile up in your face but I ain't your friend Poppy
Jump out the fifteen hundred like runnin, niggas don't want it
Get it, Done it, when I'm blunted
However it went down, I made it happen, made it scrapin
I made it fussin, bustin, I made it cappin
And lettin off wasn't nothing new to a nigga
Something to do to a nigga, Cause you is a fool nigga
I know your type, you hype, all up off that fake shit
You can't understand why a man would have to take shit
Or steal shit, but this is that real, niggas kill shit, peel shit
I hit you in your head you won't feel shit!!!
URRUURRRR.....
Let the dogs lose on a niggas ass
Find out if the niggas faster then the trigger's blast
A fucking snake in the truest form
Knowin damn well that what I do is wrong, plus what I do is strong
Niggas is makin movies so i gots to stop production
I need a block to function and maybe I'll stop destructin
The blocks is not for frontin, So let me get that shorty
Cause you don't need that shorty
you don't know what to do with that shorty
You might as well hit this 40, before you hit the floor
Another 24, What you want, Money, More!!
Them niggas did it raw, with no condom
You find em, sayin sorry he for what he said before I blind them
Get the flame out the four fifth, and there aint gonna be no more riff
Dog you want a floss tiff, but would of made it to the door if
Bullets travled alot slower, and you ran alot faster
But they don't and you can't so don't think about after
Cause tomorrow ain't comin, so stop runnin
cause you gonna die like a sucker
Murder Motherfucker!!!
Uh!, where my mother fucking dogs at, Uh, Uh

Yo, yo, I know niggas wit honor and will
That'll still crush the blow up and then pass they mama the bill
So I'ma always be able to burn my strip
Cuz my bags be stuffed and I burn my tips
And it aint no tellin what the snub'll do
So when y'all go and cop S's cop one for your mother too
And I'm way better than them other dudes
But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit
Cuz I don't suck dick
Sat with the plays and I stood with the cultures
And I'ma always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters
And I control all the fishscale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the Kiss is a hustler
[CHORUS:]
[Styles:] He's a hustler
[Jadakiss:] I hustle anywhere, any town, any borough, any strip, uh
[S:] He's a gambler
[J:] I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
[S:] He's a gangster
[J:] I always make the paper and the FBI got me on they list, that's why
[S:] He's a Ruff Ryder nigga, Ryde or Die nigga
[J:] By the way, did I tell you that my name is Kiss?
[Verse 2]
And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter'll dust you so get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue M
I'm like Lou Sims
And I'ma make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building
Cuz now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
Alotta niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life
This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more Kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips
[CHORUS]
[Verse 3]
Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of Mauseburgs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread
Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, cuz it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name
We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in New York
Cuz some of us is runnin from court
Smokin weed, mumblin thoughts
Tryin to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh

and I gots to be the realest nigga (UHH) up in this game
Cause ain't no shame, they don't make em like, this no more
Real to the core, big heart but built for war
I stand for what I believe in
Even if what I believe in stops me from breathin
Relatives grievin, but I ain't went nowhere
Listen to the song (C'MON) I'm right there

[DJ Kay Slay]
Aiyyo, this is DJ Kay Slay from around the way
And my dog DMX is puttin' it down with the Bloodline family
And the Bloodline kennels
THE GREAT DEPRESSION! FOURTH TIME!
X keeps it gutter and his dogs are no differant
You gotta respect the line...
First out the kennel, Jynx reprepin' straight from Y.O. kennel
Holdin it down...
[Jynx]
Let it be known, bring it to me
Break the fingers that you write with
Mouth that you recite with, real life shit
Niggaz call me God on beats, cuz I light shit
Quicker than those, shootin' big holes, rippin' your clothes
Play games and have a thug nigga sittin' at your home
See you walkin' with that bitch when he spit at yo dome
Damn, ya brains all over the place
Bitch cryin' and screamin', cuz your brains is all over her face
I got love for street thugs and killers, with deep mugs
Who bust they guns first then they start to cuss
Shook niggaz hold they guns 'til they start to rust
Bitch niggaz don't want no parts of us, we dangerous
Tripped a few of angel dust
One shot turn yo brains to slush
Yeah, niggaz don't learn shit 'til the lights is off
It's too late, now your life is lost, motherfucker...
[beat changes to ""Bring Ya Whole Crew""]
[DJ Kay Slay]
DAMN! See what I'm sayin', this shit is real
Next out the kennel, barkin' from Dirty Jerz is that nigga Loose
[Loose]
Let me Loose nigga, get the fuck off me
I can't believe my ears, hot, these niggaz is barely warm
In fact they wack, they just got a hot song
Fuckin' up the game is catz like you
That make wack niggaz ???
But Loose at the door now, so come with me
I'ma make sure no more rappers like you get in
You want it? We can go hard with the beats
Or hard to the body or hard to the teeth
Yeah, I was on Universal, they couldn't have me
They kept me on the hush, like Whitney drug habit
Got drafted, then made it to the front line
A year later, got traded to Bloodline
Now it's hard for catz to keep they spot
He rock too much ice, he can't keep it hot
And when all the ice melt, they all want it down
Loose, fuck that, the streets is mines now...
[beat changes to ""D-X-L Hard White""]
[DJ Kay Slay]
FIRE! Only stray kills, yaknowhatimsayin?
Next out the kennel, my nigga Big Stan from Harlem
Get at 'em dog...
[Big Stan]
Uh-oh, who's next? That would be me, B.S., ya know?
Uh, ya niggaz ain't ready, uh
I'm like a thieve in the night, I creep in your life
One day when you nice, high off the henny
Catch you while you partyin' right
With the semi, put your body on ice, for a price
Make a bastard of your son as well as widow your wife
My struggle was tight, love inside my heart has limits
Like anything outside of Bloodline, bound to get it
We bound to win it, niggaz want, we bound to give it
And anything you catz start, you know we bound to finish
Can you see the cage is open? Muzzle is off
The nine is sick, the silencer will muffle the cough
The Line is thick, Stan stay solo on cost
My shoulder will frost on any nigga other than Dog
I'm the one ya moms would hate you to cross
If you the only child, would be replacing the lost
Please think before you go against the B dot S
And no it's not a game, I'm one of Bloodline's best, nigga...
[beat changes to ""Make a Move""]
[DJ Kay Slay]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, they just keep bitin'
The last to bite, that bitch, the bitch of the litter
Crazy Kash, Kasmir, get at 'em girl...
[Kashmir]
What the fuck yall niggaz know about dreams
i got enough to put a end to yo peace
plus bust ten in yo piece
make yo back bend in a crease
thats what you get offendin a beast
you hatin me like you a friend of kelis
load cock back and release
bad bitch crackin yo piece
bulletholes in the back of yo peeps
bound to catch niggas comin from the back with the heat
love to watch they knees buckle when they smack the concrete
you aint gotta love me just respect a bitch
scared to fight me get ya girl so i can wet the bitch
who gives a fuck who yo old lady be
i put holes in her old navy tee if she fuckin wit me
you know my niggaz Stan, Jynx, Loose, Bird and X
yall niggas switchin occupations cuz ya heard we next
No nigggaz above mine, cuz no niggaz above mine
and this shits in my heart cuz its in my fuckin bloodline

Please give me the strength I need to live...
Bear with me
Amen
We each walk the path  that we've chosen
[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord
Lord  you left me stranded
And I don't know why
Told me to live my life,
Now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly
I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still coming at me
Just missing
Sometimes I think all you doing me is just listen
I thought that I was special
Thats what you told me
Hold me
Stop acting like you don't know me
What'd I do so bad that it sent you away from me
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me
(My child I'm here, as I've always been, it was you who went away,
And now are back again, what did I say?)
Follow your word, and be true
(What did you do?)
Wellwhat I wanted to do...
(What have you seen?)
Darkness and hell at a glance
(What do you want?)
All I want is another chance
Chorus
(Just because you went away, my doors are not locked, wanna come back
home,
all you gotta do is knock)
Ya see, I left home a boy, I returned as a man
Full grown, and I'm still not able to stand
(I gave you a hand)
Well...but I was looking the wrong way
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer, took me from here to over there
Back to over here,
Now they got me like where?
Do I belong?
Do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start?
(Thou shall not steal)
But, what if he stole from me?
(Thou shall not kill)
But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
(Thou shall not, take my, name in vain, no matter how hard it rains,
withstand the pain)
Chorus
Our father, who art in heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance, at 27
No longer afraid to knock on your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the lord
Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen, what I need to see
Please take me, where I need to be
(What have you learned?)
It's better to tell the truth than to lie
(What have you learned?)
To love my life until I die
(What have you learned?)
Violence isn't always the key
(What have you learned?)
You can't always believe what you see
(What have you learned?)
It's better to forgive and forget
(What have you learned?)
Give as you expect to get
(What have you learned?)
That I can't go on without you
(What have you learned?)
I musta been a fool to ever doubt you

I'm ready to meet him

Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

Niggas is gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in their mouth.
And then I stuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all thats that left

Til I pass, cause they asked, and I smelled em
The S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead

For these plats though I leave nothin but widows,
You're a gang, but so what, can you really bang with us?
Be like a phone, cause we off the hook,
And ya'll better hang it up,
I stay high, but I don't plan to go to heaven,
I plan to burn like the furnace, til ya'll learn,
Even if it's with the burners,
Until your mom can dish straight, forget her son,
To give her the dick, tore a clip and I stripped her one,
For that's dragon, that's the one,
What's blastin, that's his gun,
Who's lastin, no one,
So if you splashin to blow one,
Like I said before, I'ma lock it down like Shaqula
So make your sister be the ??? and none back to her.

After midnight, busta niggas can't even hang out,
Niggas on the west, we put them dank things out,
Drive by and try to blow them fuckin brains out,
And cocaine drought,
survive and reside with a new click,
But use the same route,
Pull the range out,
Get brains pal, while I'm drivin,
Live and direct, front five and a tech,
Stash in the Range, but nine in the Lex,
Got bitches, shining briggets, for me,
Grindin correct, for me,
Signin off checks, for me,
Send a bitch outta town, now she buyin the bricks, for me,
Passes from the brick, homie,
Keep grindin with your click, homie,
Cause on top there's no way,
Cock your chromayy,
Stock your monayyy,
Feds caught the homayyy,
It's just the monay got coppers on mayyy,
Helicopters on mayyy, bust off the blockers phonayyy,
Ramshack this house, put choppers on it,
Bitches safe and shit, niggas takin shit,
Break his wrist, pistol whipping duck tape his bitch.
Chorus (2 times)
Yukmouth:
Bitch, to all my niggas locked in Rita and Simson,
We still the ice cream men,
Just switched it up from a truck to a great benz,
We made men, and kingpins, triple-beam men,
Give me a quarter key, I bet I flip a key,
By the weekend, our styles are grand theiven,
If not, niggas ain't leavin,
Unless they bleed the demon prayer from my deacon,
In front of the casket, you done it you bastard,
I pack mathematics to keep it crackin,
Head ride to ask it, BITCH!

That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot,
Fat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with,
The jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools,
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin,
Niggaz called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin,
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga,  FUCK is you be sniffin?
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin,
Gots to say nuttin, niggaz know they get half,
And I can still laugh, at those who's toes I'm steppin on,
Disrespect and pulling out a weapon on,
Nice joint, I know you wish you coulda kept it on,
But that's another story, don't even sweat, it's gone (echo gone).

This is what I know (this what I know)
So to me (so to me) this is life (this is life)
[Chorus: DMX (repeat 2X)]
One more road to cross
One more risk to take
Gotta live my life
like there's one more move to make
[DMX]
I'm up at like 6 AM, to check this nigga
He work the nightshift, and I gots to check them figures
Knock on his door, peoples talkin bout, ""He ain't there,""
but the house is packed, shit I know he here somewhere
See money get high, I don't knock what a nigga do to get by
Just make sure you gettin by don't FUCK with you gettin mine
Ain't the first time he ran off, shoulda split his shit then
Hate to think of what he's did and if I catch him slippin
won't be an ass-whippin, I can tell you that
I keep it real with this cat, he go and sell two packs
and run off (damn) tell me, he was locked down, up North
and you out a week later That's bullshit!
I bust off, I need this dough
Fuck you think I'm here for my health
I need this wealth, because I feed myself
You play with my life, when you play with my money
Playin around but this'll be the last time you think somethin's funny
[Chorus]
[DMX]
Yo, I've been casin the liquor store, for a month now
with me and two other niggaz, is about to run up in there and shut it down
I got four people on the inside, one stay in the back
Two stock boys, one at the register but he count the stacks
Aight bitch, put on the ski mask, make sure that when we ask
for the dough they know that we takin all three bags
Now see that You gotta hear em shoot that nigga
Matter of fact, you hit the back, I'll put two in that nigga
Hardhead motherfuckers always get it
I told him what would happen if he moved the nigga moved so I did it
Did you get it I asked my man as he was comin from the back
Nigga opened his mouth said nothin and fell out flat
This cat come out spittin, hittin my mans, his mans
Couldn't control what was in his hands
I'm hit, damn! I bust back, and got the fuck up out of there
Didn't get a dime, but at least I got up out of there
[Chorus]
[DMX]
Aiyyo I see it, try to avoid it, but it comes
That's how it's goin in the slums over crumbs
Somethin little becomes somethin major
Niggaz gettin blown up like a pager
Ear to ear with the razor, pour out my soul
Took control of hurt, why must Earl Simmons, swim in dirt
I'm gon' make it work, twenty-eight and tryin to get, baptized
Priest cannot touch me cause he said I gave him bad vibes
Ryde, when I Die, straight down, but I'm plottin
We all gots to go but who wants to be forgotten
I'ma leave a mark, and it won't be the mark of the devil
Throw dirt and may your hands burn when you touch the shovel
The level of animosity is stoppin me from thrivin
FUCK what them niggaz is talkin about, I'm survivin
Alive and goin through it, but I made my bed
So now it's in these flames that I, lay my head

We play the front not the back, when there's beef I attack

How the fuck you teaching me I ain't got no obedience
Ya'll are made of shit I'm the thug's ingredients
And for my niggers I peel like fucked up paint jobs
Cover your block and put holes in you like old blankets
Fuck a bitch use a sock and wipe my nut what?
Run in your spot and use a Glock to get my cut what?
Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what?
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son
And the only bullets by my stomach be the clip from my gun
And when my gun busts it's over so close the curtains

I make the kind of green that hustler's dream
Busting out that custard cream
Piper cause I'm piped up with the mustard team
Plus the queen Fort Knox and hearts
King of medallions Monty Guard
Even Italians see my battalion prop the broad
I got the squad over qualified pulling over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted three wilted hydraulic slide
Spark the Live in the crowd ripping trough housings
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
John Blazing on a pound of buddha and all the mami chulas,

You know the red one from the video
But really though she ain't coming and she ain't running the

In the name of Jesus
Let us pray
Father please walk with us through the bad times as well as the good
May we be heard and understood from the suburbs to the hood
May you judge us by our hearts and not by our mistakes
And see that we get a breakthrough however long that it takes
May you fill that void in our souls that will lay our fears to rest
Cause there is no way we can live for Jesus when we're liven in the flesh
So I pray that you allow our sprits to be born
Go strong move on know right from wrong
Verse John Chapter 2 verse 15
do not love the world or anything in the world and we know what that means
But lessen we know the distance we need to keep away from fire to keep it missing
That doesn't mean we'll listen
Lord you take care of fools and babies
You teach women to honor their men and men respect their ladies
But lately so many of us have gone a stray
Doing wrong for so long that we've forgotten the way
Please bring us back home and still in us the word witch is our backbone
Which is children that act grown
There is so much that we're entitled to yet we receive so little
Cause in this time of spiritual warfare we're comfortable in the middle
So I pray that you open our eyes
Give us the unknowing to recognize the devil and his lies
If we keep our actions wise and our prays sincere
Our heads to the sky you will demonist our fears
In Jesus name we have prayed
Amen and Amen

DMX McGruff and Canibus.
You know where you heard it first.
My man Cardin, G Black, Ralph, Universal Records.
Uh [all echoes]. Pure Uncut,
Eightball [DMX barks in background]
DMX (What) DMX, McGruff, McGruff, and Canibus, baby.
Yeah, its the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw.
Its the Pure Uncut, raw we keep it raw. Listen...
[DMX]
Niggas at Ruff Ryders is the illest, baby gorillas
And shit we do today is gon' catch up with us and kill us
Long as I feel this, motherfucker's head is shot
Fucking lead is hot, and leave them dead to rot
Ruff Ryders cut the shit up, like raw keys
Like that crystal aching my last name is Raheed
It can happen niggas, dog keys, and still gun it down
Only cause I know how you look up to a nigga, from the ground
Running clown, you no better, than a braveless heart
For my kids I thank you God
And if you don't know, ask a nigga, that they just put in the ground
Slugs ran out of him, so I must've put in a pound
At least! I gave it to another nigga for lookin
Money, could never stop my slugs from cookin
Remember me, cause I'ma be there when they bury, you
Leave your skeleton in the cemetery
[Eightball]
Dum, du-du, dum
Who got the, who got the bum bu-bu bum
We wrap it up and smoke it, sixty green
I'm a fiend for this rap thing
Down South hustiln' and we all about the cream
Stick em up, mad face, car chase through the city
Fuck the police, I'm mad plus I'm going off that gritty
Frank Nitty got a mob down to murder with me
Catch one to stick me, believe it or not, I cripply
I rip thee, back into a stack and flip it like a tech
Pure uncut, tie it up, and watch the fiends come back
Bucklin, real dogs stay around for troublin
Eightball, pick up the ball, when them tricks start bumblin
Rumblin (vrooom) much room, cloud trippin
Victims who lie there die when I be speakin, releasin
You heard me, are you worthy
To ride with the Suave House and get down and dirty
[Chorus Eightball]
Its the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw [2X]
Baby Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
Its the Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
(What) Nigga, Pure Uncut, raw, we keep it raw
[repeat]
[McGruff]
Yo; where the fuck is the dough its time to bubble and blow
If I spit this from the back, have em clutchin they toes
Once smoked my lungs out, but now I fuck with my nose
Perform shows, bad bitches crunchin my clothes
Yo I'm 'Gruff, street thug beyond the speakers, beyond the rap
Man I'm on a car and my gat, swarm attack, sip Don and Cognac
Ain't just me, my whole freakin army strapped
Aiyyo, fuck that! And fuck you! Who the fuck you
Touch you, you act like you want trouble
Money don't know you, don't rub you, I got' eat, that's like trying to tell me don't hustle
I gotta blow a couple, niggas away just to show the muscle
Yo, I squeeze till your vocal tussle
Niggas please, I got keys, coke, and snow to bubble
Hoes to cuff you, fuck you, suck the shit out your dick
Sucker for love, think you can fuck with McGruff
Now listen mister
Gruff put your soul in a twister
[Canibus]
Just got off the payphone, on a three-way line, with Eightball and Tony Draper
Askin me for a favor
Now let me take it from the top I touch your knot, with the rubber glock
Then I take your title, nigga, fuck your spot
Peace to the players who crush a lot, but they call me Canibus because I bust a lot
You can suck my cock, and got the same transmitted disease your mother got
Being a favorite with me right before she was forced to pop
She came home at four o'clock, was shot, she was riding me on top
I told the bitch to keep the door locked, I know your heating up hot
Because I touched the sure spot, you got defeated and dropped
I punch you in the jaw-ops
You talk dirt, you get dirt thats how I stand on niggas networks
You think that best works You think you can't get hurt
The bitch in you, makes you run for cover when I spit at you
A man-to-man zone Allen Iverson couldn't dribble through
Rapid fire syllables, you gotta bribe me with a mill or two
To keep me from killing you with the lyrical
All you chief executives ampin answer wreckin shit
See, what goes around comes around, bitch

Let us pray.
I thank you Lord for my birth, and everythings thats followed.
I thank you Lord for today, and I will pray for tomorrow.
I thank you Lord for the love of my life and a friend.
I made a promise, and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end.
I thank you Lord for your guidance, cause thats all that counts.
And right here, right NOW, Lord this is your house.
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light.
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight.
I don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me.
Cause I need you here wit me, without you in my life it's empty.
I think back to how some people did me like, violence was the remedy.
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy.
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know.
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody, won't go.
So I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see.
And I thank you for the love that, they've given to me.
I will not abuse it, nor will I lead them astray.
See, I love 'em like children, that I see everyday.
And I pray, no WE pray together, get us through the bad weather,
and we love you forever.
Let your thought, and my heart, go hand in hand.
I first thought, but to start, but I stand a man.
And for as long as I can, as long as you permit me.
Please give me, the strength I need to live.
Bare wit me.
Amen.
We each walk the path, that we've chosen.
(sung)
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law of
the Lord.
Lord you left me stranded, and I don't know why.
Told me to live my life, and now I'm ready to die.
Ready to fly, I cry but I shed no tears.
You told me you were dead.
Those fears, is for years.
Snakes still comin' at me, just missin'.
Somtimes I think that all you do at me, is just listen.
I thought that I was special, that's what you told me.
Hold me, stop actin' like you don't know me!
When I do so bad that it sends you away from me.
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me.
""My child, I'm here as I've always been. It is you who in a way, and
now I'm back again. What did I say?""
Follow your word and be true.
""What did you do?""
Well, what I wanted to do.
""What have you seen?""
Darkness and Hell at a glance.
""What do you want?""
All I want is another chance!
Ready to meet him, cause I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law
of the Lord.
""Just because you went away, my doors are not locked. When you
come back home, all you gotta do is knock.""
You see, I left home a boy, but returned as a man.
Full grown, but I am still not able to stand.
""I gave you a hand!""
But I was lookin' the wrong way.
Figured out the plan, then I started to pray.
And that prayer, took me from here, to over there.
Back to over here, now it got me like, ""Where?""
Do I belong? Do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart.
I'm really tryin' to win, so where do we start?
""Thou shalt not steal!""
But what if he stole from me?
""Thou shalt not kill!""
But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
""Thou shalt not take my name in vain, no matter how hard it rains,
withstand the pain.""
Ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war, is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him.
Our Father, who art in heaven.
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at 27.
No longer afraid to knock on your door!
Not scared anymore to lose my life in a war!
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord.
Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword.
But now that I've seen, what I need to see, please take me where I
need to be...
""What have you learned?""
It's better to tell the truth than a lie!
""What have you learned?""
To love my life, until I die!
""What have you learned?""
Violence isn't always the key!
""What have you learned?""
You can't always believe what you see!
""What have you learned?""
It's better to forgive and forget!
""What have you learned?""
Give as you expect to get!
""What have you learned?""'
That I can't go on without you!
""What have you learned?""
I must have been a fool to ever doubt you!
Ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.
They got us suspectin' a war, but the real war, is to follow the law
of the Lord.
I'm ready to meet him, cause where I'm livin' aint right.
Black hate white, white hate black, it's right back to the same fight.

Yo if gon' sleep on somethin, might as well be a bed
And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head
Cause if you targettin the L.O.X.
You might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots aint got blocks, ya punta muchacha
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in court, yeah, keeps ya cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, aint no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag? My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back
[Jadakiss]
Ayo I hope you aint tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be fuckin her in the mouth
Type of nigga buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since niggaz was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me gats
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all shit, then listen to our shit
Ain't nuttin y'all faggots could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all niggaz ain't got shit
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggaz thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Harold
Chorus: repeat 4X
The Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders
[Styles]
Fuck you and your son, y'all low wit the scum
Show me the money, I'll show you a gun, motherfucker
SP'll spin the corner while you parle' with dun
I clap you, I clap him, and thats rule number one
Suckin my dick, and I dont give a fuck what you spit
Who you are, where you from, and who the fuck you can get
Cause I sell records, plus I got a jail record
Y'all niggaz ain't sayin shit until y'all bare weapons
And even when you dead, you can still fuckin get it
A nigga that'll smack ya, fuck around and clap ya
Styles P., your favorite rapper's favorite rapper
[Eve]
Aint no surprise niggaz, only fuck wit recognized niggaz
Babygirl want the world, gave ya pies niggaz
No tops, take em in all shape and size niggaz
No lie, prefer them ready do or die niggaz
What? What you want? cutey starin at me like
""Damn, where you from?"" You be comin at me like
""Can I get some?"" Lick your lips for this brown sugar
Suck mine like a thumb, if you want, til I come, uh
-Chorus-
[Drag-On]
I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often
Comma, burnin niggas often
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin
Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry
Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me, what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon
Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
cause my fire retirin, aight then
[DMX]
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

Chorus
(Right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Made me a leader before I was ready to lead
Took away my hunger, but didn't give me greed
Made me successful, when I just wanted to be heard
Give me the light, cause all I need is the word
Give me a life, that I'm responsible for
I'll give him what's right, cause I'm responsible for him
And into the night, I'm gonna be there with him
Facing a fight, I be right there with him
Ready for Heaven, cause I done been through the Hell
And since I was seven, I've had a story to tell
See God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'
He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'
The bravery of a man's mind is slavery
Is making me the man I was made to be
I hate to see when cats know but don't spit it
Right is wrong, when it's on you gon' get it
Chorus
I wake up frustrated dog, I'm hurtin' inside
Think about the brothers that put in, work and then died
A certain have tried, a certain have cried
When it didn't go right, you hit me like
You see things ain't always what they seem to be
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me
And the reason I get through things so easily
Is by the grace of God cause he, see's the need to guide me
Walk right beside me
Because he knows what's going on inside me, he tried me
Knew where my heart was at
Knew what I was thinking
Knew when I was down and out, left there mistaken
Knew when to pick me up, cause it got too hard
Knew when I was gonna scream out ""Please God!""
And you already knew that you would be there for me
That's why I bring you together to give you the glory
Chorus
Everyday of life is a new chapter
And it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture
The essence of it all, the meek shall inherit the earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man, is not measured by what he does for himself but
What he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for a reward of gold
What you give, you shall receive to tenfold
And I, put that on my soul
And, put that on my life
And, everything I own
And, everything I know
And, everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everywhere I been, I was for a reason
Walk through the desert, ended up freezing
Start there, end up where?
And now they know...whatever which way they go
Chorus
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go
They know they gonna owe
They soul to the road they choose
It don't matter if you win or loose
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues

So what, I drink and smoke too much
So what I cuss too much, *shut the fuck up!*
[Redman]
Yo, yo, now when we roll
You motherfuckers tuck in your gold
Cuz for the platinum, I'm jackin niggas up in limos
It aint nothin, for bullets to unbutton your clothes
Description, yellow male, tissue up in his nose
You bitches, swing the vine on the bathroom nuts
I'm hairy as hell, outta hell and tattoed up
I'm a dog only fuck in the bathroom, what
In high school, I dealt only with the classroom sluts
[Method Man]
My name is, Johnny, Donnie, Brasco
Tuck the gat low, cut your cash flow
Yell if you want money, funny
A hungry dummy snatch crumbs from me
Doc and Hot Niks, bodies in the mosh pit
[Redman]
Yo, and I'm the D.O., you lookin at the raw invented
On Friday, I spit 35 to 40 minutes
Smell up, the bathroom like Craig Paul was in it
Endin up, on your back, Wu swords up in it
Anyone can match me I crack 'em all to Guinness
Fuck how many thugs, players, and ballers in it
Brick City, Shaolin, better call us sinners
Boys that'll run up in your wife, maul and spill it
PPPPPPP P- P- POW!
[AAAAAAAAAHH!]
Yo we said c'mon!!
[HOOK]
[DMX] It just don't get no darker than that kid with the barker
Bald head with the boots who shoots to make it spark
I'm a fair nigga, but aint nann nigga
Quicker than the hand trigga, so if you dare nigga
It'll be like your man tryin to hold your brain to your head
But you'll be shittin on yourslef cuz you already dead
And at the funeral you won't need a casket
Leavin just enough of him to stuff in a basket
Just get the casket, I really need my ass kicked
My mom never let me forget, that I'm a bastard
I aint never been shit, and aint gon' be shit
That's why I taste shit, whenever I see shit
It's just that D shit, D's short for do what I wanna do
And that's what I'm gonna do, right here in front of you
And I'll be runnin you and your man straight up out
And y'all niggas aint runnin a fuckin thing but your mouth
[DMX bark]
AAAAAAAAHHH!!!
[HOOK]
[Durst]
You, wanna mess with Limp Bizkit [yeah]
You can't mess with Limp Bizkit [why]
Because we get it on, [when] every day and every night [oh]
See this platinum thing right here [uh huh]
Well we doin it all the time [what]
So you better get some better beats
And uh, get some better rhymes [oooh!]
You really, really, really wanna get shit started
Well people everywhere just get retarded
Get retarded, get retarded, people everywhere just get retarded!
[HOOK]
That's right baby!
Watch out punk!
Limp Bizkit! DMX! Method Man! Redman!
And Swizz Beatz!
Where the fuck you at! [DMX bark]
Bump that shit! Bump that shit! Bump that shit! Bump that shit!

In the streets,
(swizz beats),and this thing right here will
Take ya ass of ya feet.
Verse one: drag-on
They call me drag-on
It's time to ball
Im gonna burn'em all
To they all say turn'em off
These chips i gonna earn'em all
Chicken heads know i be the kernall
Cause i burn internall
Mixed with the inferno
So be careful for i burn you
You better learn duke
Yeah, i heard you
But i'm gonna hurt you
What you don't know
Ours verse who?
Is a virtue
Ruff ryders be the team
Which means
A lot of cream
Runin' skeems
Stunnin' beams
To make ya'll stop drop right on the scene
This nigga here is to hot
And to much
For you to touch
Betta tell ya man
If two touch
Then he too will get you bust
You bust?
We do
You can ask people
But quitly
They don't believe us til they lead violate
Is you buyin' this
Cause niggaz that purchase
Is under the dirt kid
They call me drag-on
I'm the youngest
But get bunka's
Callabo wit' my dogz from yonka's
Plus these bronx bomba's
Spittin' flame to the gutta
But ya all get flamed
Chorus x2: DMX
My dogz gon' stop
Ya'll dogz gon' drop
Then we gon'
Shut'em down open up shop
First we had'em like ooohhhh
Now they like nnnooo
What baby, thats how ruff ryders roll
Verse two: jadakiss
When i pop up
I lock shop up
Pull the drop up
Park a block up
Hit the alarm put the top up
Stash the dro in my sock
Then pull my sock up
Keep the burner
But if it's hot put my glock up
You know what i'm about
Slidin' off get my cock sucked
Writin' rhymes watchin' scarface in the hot tub
What you wanna bet
When i pull it out
If you don't shout
Then every bullet will go in and out
Who you besides kiss take a piss
In a bottle of cryse (crystal)
Then give it to a modelin' bitch
And you like ya watch plain
I'ma flood mine
Alligator bloodeline
Trade the finest coke
And write one time
Verse 3: styles
Ya niggaz ain't hearin' me out
Til i pop up appear in ya house
Clearin' it out holiday style
Everybody actin' violent and wild
Snatch the wife silence the child
Thats how we move
Kill me, my man kill you
Thats how you lose
I ruff ryde
I don't like to slide felt that i sliped
And the gunz only helpin' the clip
And the clips only my hand
And like who the fuck is helpin' ya man
When i cock back and hop the van
Double r
Get a jar
Play the shit in the car
Hit the party start a fight at the bar
Snatch ya r (rolex)
Sell ya shit for some coke
And get the fuck out the dogde
Verse four: E-V-E
Cats you, figga
That my niggaz flippa
With the trigger
News teams crowd around try to flick a picture
Get wit ya, this bitch runnin'it down to ya quicka
Nigga not makin' sence
Betta stay up off the liquor
Blonde bomb shell
Karamel, heavy spitta
Groupies sayin' i'm they sista
Hush ya mouth for i hit ya
Sickenin' wise guys and thugs and bullshitta's
Take you for a ride cover up ya eyes
Then i hit ya
Used to be shya now i'm a ruff ryda

Verse 5: DMX

Leave ya niggaz scared
Fuckin' wit' the dog

Rip that niggaz heart
Faggot niggaz saw
Remember me from up north

My name is ringin' bells
In penatentary cells

You never really wanted it
Saw the mic yo jumped in front of it
Out of sixteen i'm gonna hit
Which one of you niggaz am i gonna get
Thought you knew what i was gonna spit
This time, wit' this rhyme
By the end of it
Ya niggaz is gon' be like yo x riped it
Did my thing as usual it's never gon' stop
You cats can't be for real i got this shit locked
It's not a game or a joke
To my name or get smoked
Simple as that simple as black

Hit'em all under the coat
Now you losen' yo life

Yo if gon' sleep on somethin, might as well be a bed
And if you gon' crack a nigga, might as well be a head
Cause if you targettin the L.O.X.
You might as as well target a box
That you gon' sleep in for years, all covered wit rocks
Cause I think not, I pop shots, I double what y'all got
Ya hotshots aint got blocks, ya punta muchacha
From the days in school, now a motherfucker rule
And I could drop my chain in court, yeah, keeps ya cool
That's how ice be, I'm priceless, the iciest
And I dont gotta wear fatigues to blow out your chest
My bullets thump when I'm laced in some fly shit, punk
The baby nine be on the daily, aint no poppin a trunk
But if I pop the trunk, its to hand you a rag
So you can wipe down the windows on the side of my Jag
Must I brag?  My shit paid for, yours tagged
And every bitch you grabbed, Sheek bend em back
[Jadakiss]
Ayo I hope you aint tongue-kissin your spouse
Cause I be fuckin her in the mouth
Type of nigga buck at your house
Too slick, means she be suckin my dick
And before you know it, I'ma have her stuffin my bricks
Jada, if I kiss you now, you'll die later
I been nice since niggaz was watchin movies on Beta
Ready to clap, everybody givin me gats
Cause believe it or not, we be the ones settin the traps
You listen to y'all shit, then listen to our shit
Ain't nuttin y'all faggots could do but gossip
That's the reason now y'all niggaz ain't got shit
Cause everytime I turn around y'all on the L.O.X. dick
Niggaz thats narrow, I just smack em wit the barrel
Give it to em at the light, like Kane's cousin Harold
Chorus: repeat 4X
The Ruff Ryders! (What?) The Ruff Ryders
[Styles]
Fuck you and your son, y'all low wit the scum
Show me the money, I'll show you a gun, motherfucker
SP'll spin the corner while you parle' with dun
I clap you, I clap him, and thats rule number one
Suckin my dick, and I dont give a fuck what you spit
Who you are, where you from, and who the fuck you can get
Cause I sell records, plus I got a jail record
Y'all niggaz ain't sayin shit until y'all bare weapons
And even when you dead, you can still fuckin get it
A nigga that'll smack ya, fuck around and clap ya
Styles P., your favorite rapper's favorite rapper
[Eve]
Aint no surprise niggaz, only fuck wit recognized niggaz
Babygirl want the world, gave ya pies niggaz
No tops, take em in all shape and size niggaz
No lie, prefer them ready do or die niggaz
What?  What you want? cutey starin at me like
""Damn, where you from?""  You be comin at me like
""Can I get some?""  Lick your lips for this brown sugar
Suck mine like a thumb, if you want, til I come, uh

I be the D-R, A-G, dash O-N, slash often
Comma, burnin niggas often
They call me Drag-On, I'm hot scorchin
Keep the block roastin
Light a dutch wit the flames comin, toastin
In my eyes you could see what summer's holdin
Realizin, every guy I'll fry or dead rowdy
I burn to a degree of 130, and my gun dirty
Cause it got one bury, so you better run, hurry
Or catch one early
You wrong, tryin to touch me,  what type of shit you on?
You better through your boots on and your unflammable suits on
Cause I'm comin through wit a Yukon
Black tinted wit gats in it
Catch you while you smokin, send your casket, throw the sack in it
But only half of it, cause y'all like half-ass dude
And we are one whole, and y'all niggaz is one slash two
My gun blast you, tryna out the flames, what're you, firemen?
You'll catch a hell of a backdraft
cause my fire retirin, aight then
[DMX]
Its my, survival instinct that keeps my head above the water
Everyday I show another how a I love a slaughter
Flood your daughter, full of more holes than spurges
Taxin businessmen for stocks over lunches
Wit these, I shoot the breeze, and extort
Enough keys from the Cuban, to build a fuckin fort
Caught up in somethin that I cant control
Tryna get a hold of a bankroll, let's role
Catch bodies like a cold, and I stay slick so face it
Make me chase it, I take your life and erase it
Waste it, in the fuckin streets cause it ain't worth shit
The undertaker take your ass under the earth quick, I
Love money, but the scrambles hot
So i snatch up my man and the gamblin spot
Twenty grand is got, one niggaz shot, one nigga less
What used to be his chest is now a mess under his fuckin vest

Knumskull (DMX)
Yeah Yeah, now we on the west coast (nigga),
Hooked up with my partners, Ruff Ryders,
To represent the turf,
Come to lay down the turf stories,
To represent real brothers gettin money, on the paper chase (nigga),
We gon start off with my man, so, you know what I'm sayin, DMX let em know.
DMX:
Niggas is gettin trampled on, what's all the fuss about?
Suckin my dick so hard, I'm bustin in their mouth.
And then I stuff em out, four to the mid', fuck what I did
With no regard for a bid, ripped you up, while you wit your kid
Slid into the shadows, cause I'm dark like that
I bark like that, jet black, but I spark like that
Where ARE they at, when I get thirsty, shit
Ain't a nigga strong enough to stand the worst it gets
Bits, and pieces are all thats that left
Niggaz so scared to death, they hold they motherfuckin breath
Til I pass, cause they asked, and I smelled em
The S-P-E-L-L-E-D T-H-E-M, I spelled em
To make me have to swell one, eye up, lump up one head
Catch a body with the shottie, pump up one dead
Red alert, niggaz is about to get hurt, do work
to skirts, like a jag on the merk, ARF
Night time is the right time for creepin
Vandalize your crib, rape your wife while she's sleepin
I been off the deep end, since I was semen
That's why now, I'm such a motherfuckin demon!
SCREAMIN, my bloody head off, shit on my mind I gotsta get off
Can't even hold a joint, lest I let off
A couple of rounds, from the big three pound, seven
That's about eleven hundred as of now.
Chorus- (2 times)
Yukmouth (DMX):
We ride, side to side, guys back to back, (nigga)
Surrounded by a wolfpack, tryin to scrap with gats,
You betta ride or die, nigga ride or die, (uh huh, uh huh)
You gotta ride or die, nigga ride or die!
Drag-On:
I put a grenade in your pocket to blow your arms out,
Put something black in your moms mouth, ya'll cats better calm down,
This rap shit is Drag-On's now, if I catch ya'll clowns,
No question what I axe (ask) ya'll clowns, I'ma gat ya'll down,
For the benjamin bills, I shoulda been killed,
I keeps it real though,
For these plats though I leave nothin but widows,
You're a gang, but so what, can you really bang with us?
Be like a phone, cause we off the hook,
And ya'll better hang it up,
I stay high, but I don't plan to go to heaven,
I plan to burn like the furnace, til ya'll learn,
Even if it's with the burners,
Until your mom can dish straight, forget her son,
To give her the dick, tore a clip and I stripped her one,
For that's dragon, that's the one,
What's blastin, that's his gun,
Who's lastin, no one,
So if you splashin to blow one,
Like I said before, I'ma lock it down like Shaqula
So make your sister be the ??? and none back to her.

After midnight, busta niggas can't even hang out,
Niggas on the west, we put them dank things out,
Drive by and try to blow them fuckin brains out,
And cocaine drought,
survive and reside with a new click,
But use the same route,
Pull the range out,
Get brains pal, while I'm drivin,
Live and direct, front five and a tech,
Stash in the Range, but nine in the Lex,
Got bitches, shining briggets, for me,
Grindin correct, for me,
Signin off checks, for me,
Send a bitch outta town, now she buyin the bricks, for me,
Passes from the brick, homie,
Keep grindin with your click, homie,
Cause on top there's no way,
Cock your chromayy,
Stock your monayyy,

It's just the monay got coppers on mayyy,
Helicopters on mayyy, bust off the blockers phonayyy,
Ramshack this house, put choppers on it,
Bitches safe and shit, niggas takin shit,
Break his wrist, pistol whipping duck tape his bitch.

Yukmouth:
Bitch, to all my niggas locked in Rita and Simson,
We still the ice cream men,
Just switched it up from a truck to a great benz,
We made men, and kingpins, triple-beam men,
Give me a quarter key, I bet I flip a key,
By the weekend, our styles are grand theiven,
If not, niggas ain't leavin,
Unless they bleed the demon prayer from my deacon,
In front of the casket, you done it you bastard,
I pack mathematics to keep it crackin,
Head ride to ask it, BITCH!

That's why I took faggot shit, I'm a crook faggot,
Fat loops leather jackets, I bag it, along with,
The jewels smackin tools out the hands of fools,
On the strength that they don't know what they holdin,
Niggaz called me TAILOR cause the WAY that I be sewin,
Shit up cause I get up, off my ass and SKATE
Makin more moves than U-Haul, from state to state
I speak the GREAT, and if a nigga tells you different
You turn around you ask the nigga, ""FUCK is you be sniffin?""
Cause when it come to riffin, I am the riff raffin,
Gots to say nuttin, niggaz know they get half,
And I can still laugh, at those who's toes I'm steppin on,
Disrespect and pulling out a weapon on,

And if you ever go to jail, they'll rape and beat'cha
Hold up, take a breather, I'm way too tough

*BEEP* Thursday, June 28th, two, oh-two, A.M.
""I just called you and you said Domino's Pizza but,
and you said you were on your way but there's just one problem,
I'm all the way to fuckin Rochester, New York.  Wrong ho!""
[DMX]
Uhh, yo yo
Yo, not this shit again
Dog gon' be a dog, y'knahmean?  Motherfuckin dog!
Don't GET a dog, you can't take care of a dog
Gotta take care of the dog, y'know? Y'know?
Take it easy lady, y'know? Uh-huh
Give me a motherfuckin break - will ya?
Shorty was the bomb, brownskin honey with a little dough
Come to find out she was a little ho, but still yo
I pushed up, shorty had that ass like BLA-DOW
Had me schemin on how, I could get that now
Was like GIRLFRIEND (what?!) let me drop a bug in yo' ear
She was mine cause I told her what she wanted to hear
Was like yeah, she knew how it was goin down
She said page me, code zero, cause I know you get around
Didn't have a man but even if she did DEAD
Cause my game is tight like a stocking cap on a nigga's head
I said - we'll get up like nine or somethin
Don't act like, when I say that ass is mine I'm frontin
That night was right, she let me get that, hit that
Rip that, bounce it off the walls, flip that
But only, one thing went wrong, the rubber bust
But I didn't fuss cause dog, shorty was the bomb!
[Chorus: DMX *singing*]
Shortyyyy, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight
But maaan the pussy was good (uh-huh)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife, fuckin up my life
Shortyyyy, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight (just one motherfuckin night man!)
But maaan the pussy was good
(was gooder than a motherfucker, I ain't gon' front)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (uh-huh)
C'mon ma, give me a break
[DMX]
A few days later, I hit her up, just to keep it real (aight)
Was like - whassup Boo, how you been, how you feel? (aight)
She said - aight, but my friend's kinda late
Today's the 13th, and it shoulda been here on the 8th
I'm like - f'real?!  Don't stress it, it'll come
It better, cause I can't afford another, little one
She said - neither can I, I said - cool
cause I got mad shit to do and you still goin to school
So at least we had the same thing in mind (uh-huh)
Not to have this kid and, everything would be fine, BUT, I was blind
to the fact that she was settin me up, for the kill (c'mon)
Damn, why wasn't she, on the pill?
And I still, would check on her like, once a week
Sometimes I hit it, sometimes I didn't, but shorty was a freak
And whenever I would speak on the baby
Shorty would be like - I ain't havin this kid, is you crazy?
[Chorus: DMX *singing*]
But shortyyyy, UH!
We only did it for that niiiight
(man listen man, one motherfuckin night)
But maaan the pussy was good
(I ain't gon' front, pussy was good as a motherfucker)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife
(Oh MAN this bitch is a fuckin HEADACHE!) fuckin up my life
Shortyyyy, UH! (Shorty was definitely a bomb dog)
We only did it for that niiiight
(One motherfuckin night, AND I was drunk)
But maaan the pussy was good
(The pussy, MAN! Let me tell you)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (Dog, this bitch is a problem)
C'mon ma, give me a break
[DMX]
By now, wasn't lookin too good
Cause she wasn't doin things that she told me she would
Like gettin the price checked out for what we had to do
And it goes up another yard for every month after two
and a half I had to laugh out of frustration (WHAT?!)
Now she's fo' months, I'm ready to hit the bus station (man)
If I was, still on that shit it woulda made me rob her
Told her friends - DMX? Yeah that's my baby's father (uh-oh)
Her lil' stomach is shown (uh-huh) so now the heat is on
Maybe she'll see the light, if I start to treat her wrong
Like if she thought that if she kept the baby she would keep me (what?)
So I played the game on her level, got sneaky (aight?!)
Let her have the kid, she said it was premature (uh-huh)
Found out, she was six months, when she said she was four (uh-huh)
So I left her with the pressure on the next man's arm
But she'll be aight, cause shorty was the bomb (f'real)
[Chorus: DMX *singing*]
But shortyyyy, UH! (was the bomb)
We only did it for that niiiight
(I mean what, one fuckin night? C'mon ma)
But maaan the pussy was good (man she sucked a mean dick)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife
(Now this bitch won't stop callin, what the fuck man?)
Fuckin up my life
Shortyyyy, UH! (She was kinda cute though)
We only did it for that niiiight (All it takes is one night man, haha)
But maaan the pussy was good (mmm-mm-mmm!)
But shorty's fuckin up my liiife (This bitch, has got to go)
C'mon ma, give me a break

[50 Cent]
Move on over, I done told ya boyyyy
I'm a G-Unit motherfuckin soldier boyyyy
And when you gon' get it in your brain
The gate's wide open and the dog's off the chain
I be that yung'n with that gun-ness, tellin ya stop frontin
I be that yung'n on the run, after I pop some'n
In the Bible I read, death is of the tongue
And if you talk about death enough death is gon' come
Dave taught me how to flow, they shot him in the head
Randy ass was there, now he runnin scared
Some say I'm gangsta, some say I'm craaazy
If you ask me I'll say I'm what the hood made me
Now I can stunt 'til my ass dead broke like Jay-Z
Or put a hundred grand on e'ry nigga head that play me
See I'm cool with them Hatian mob niggaz
? Tu say sapa say mavule ? and rob niggaz
The media be tryin to make a nigga look bad, whassup with that?
See my flick, next to bring Papi and Cat
And Montana, I kill 'em with the grammar
I enhanced in the slammer after bangin them hammers
X whattup?  (AIGHT!!)
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You don't live that, you shouldn't say that
Cause what come out your mouth'll get you SHOT, DOWN
Throwin your money around and we don't play that
Get in our line'll get you SHOT, DOWN (nigga)
We know where you hang, we know where you stay at
That bullshit you on'll get you SHOT, DOWN
Here's a few clips that you shouldn't play with
G-Unit, Ruff Ryders'll get you SHOT, DOWN
[DMX]
Aiyyo, fuck y'all niggaz talkin bout, think you playin wit?
Double R, G-UNIT, the same ol' shit (WHAT!)
Put the faggots in the ring, watch 'em all quit
All y'all niggaz is pussy, suck my dick!
Ain't nuttin but a handful of man still standin
I remember 50 in a cypher when Onyx was ""Slammin"" (AIGHT?)
Now we meet again, it's all good my nigga
Back to the street again, it's all hood my nigga
Knock on wood my nigga, we both walk the dog
We ain't get to where we at by luck, shit was hard (AIGHT?)
But once we got through the trials it's all smiles
'til a big type nigga all of a sudden get wild
Now why you gotsta go and take me back to where I came from?
I'ma make you remember, where you know my name from (YEA!)
45th Street, and BLAOW-BLAOW Ave.
I done ran through your crew and only let off half, nigga!
[Chorus]
[Styles P]
Yeah, word, yeah
If your head ain't offa your shoulders (uh-huh)
You ain't get shot, you got nicked nigga (just nicked)
Cause if my chrome hit a piece of your bone
It's gon' do more than chip, nigga (a lot more than that)
Yea, what the fuck is the problem
The Porsche is red the buckets is Army
30 shot handguns the gutter is starvin (yea)
Niggaz like me might rush your apartment (word)
Bloodstains'll fuck up your carpet, brain on the window
I smell murder every time that the wind blow
Tie him to the chair and then knock out his chinbone
I don't want the throne or the crown, I ain't sellin up
You can have the jail or the ground, you ain't in hell enough
I'm the one that flood the gutters
Better tap your man, and let him know P'll love to cut his
And niggaz is gettin shot down, two guns up
Double R, S.P. holdin D Block down

Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down
Shut 'em down [4x]
[Verse 1:]
Yo shut 'em down start the violence
We wilin' wilin' sling back his body found
Washed up on Coney Island
When I rolled up, this niggas heart slowed up
That killa froze up, when I pulled up jumped out with the pump-pump
Thirty-two shots and ducked out
So look out
Left that cat for dead his body smoked out
Cause when I fall y'all killas a kill me kid
I'm goin' all out
Lifes a bitch, fuck it, got the gun bust it
Gmae play, gotta play by the rules or your own cannot be trusted
Don't try to test, abide your chest, put five inside your vest
Have you layin' with a dead rest
Shoulda known when you was lookin' in the eyes a death
And I swore forgiveness when I did this
there was not no witness but he should understand
Cause even God got a shit list
[Verse 2:]
Beat downs anonymous
I spit like a shiny silver nanabus()
Niggas fond of us
We the kind that rush, those that hold back
Takin' your whole stack
Grimy street cats
Niggas bald head like Kojak
Go gat for gat
Coat that
You could smoke that
Or cut black dust
Makin' your whole fuckin' stove crack
Betta know me
1-3, one and only could be never phoney in any ceremony
I'l tear you homey
Shut 'em down, Shut 'em down, Shut 'em down
Shun sees takin' your time
Makin' your mind
Got this nigga on the low

Breakin' your spine
Got you movin' from the flurry, time to worry
I'ma bury the bullshit
I'ma bury the bullshit
I'ma bury the bullshit
Feel my full clip

[Verse 3: DMX]
Aiyyo I bet you this muthafuckin' double barrel will blast his face
Be on the look out for a basket case
Niggas pumped you up to watch you get beat
Had you thinkin' shits sweet
Now you up shit's creek
Cause your shits weak
How mich is your life worth to someone important
Cause I be extortin'
Kidnap for ransom is some shit you don't want to get caught in
From back in the days of Gordon
Niggas was gettin' robbed
The guy from Rikers Height stayed on his job
with his own little mob
Was it worth goin back to the Earth so soon
Worth makin' my shit go boom
To your own doom, from the graveyards
Till there's no room
Fuck you know about a pine box
Money goin' out with nine Glocks
On top of that same nigga when they pull with they nine shots
Feel like killin' for your crew
I ain't gon' rest
It gonna take a whole lot to put up your best
Then watch your loins spill out your vest
You best get on some act your age shit
you a little kid
That run for faces
More niggas get killed like that
[Verse 4: Sticky Fingaz]
Mad man Sticky F-I-N-G-A-Z
The crazy cajun blazin' bullets for days and days

God of the Underground, I'm gunnin' 'em down with a thunder pound
We gonna shut 'em down
We turn we gonna shut 'em down
We turn we gonna shut 'em down
We turn shit dumb quick gun click

In the morgue admit it dogs

Fuck cocaine killer I sniff gun powder
So all you real willies throw your Roleys in the sky
And all the crooks rob the place outside

Fuck my life, I don't need no mic!

Now there's two ways we can do this, keep it real or front
I know you got what I need and I got what you want
And the hunt for soulmates is all over for us
We could go away where nobody would know it was us
Leave behind all the fuss, the studios, the pictures
No autographs, just laughs when I'm wit ya
I know what it's like when they know you now
But bark it at the dog baby, and I'll hold you down
[Mary J. Blige]
Time and time and time again
I knew that our love had to end
But now it's gone so very far
That I can make a brand new start
I thought that we were meant to be
Be one big family
But I was weak and loved you still
No matter what you did, I could forgive
[1] - All I need is sincerity
All I need is sincerity
Thinking 'bout you all the time
Never seemed to cross my mind
How you could take the time to kill
Everything our love had built
I never knew how you could hide
Everytime you told a lie
But now I know why you're so cold
But I don't understand
Now that you set me free
I truly think that we
Could find love seperately
I need sincerity
One thing, I'm not as weak
I'll always stand alone
But my mind is not made of stone
So I'll go on
[Repeat 1]
[Nas]
Chipped tooth don
Nasty, blue ice timbs on
Screw it face, half moon part, my tatoos dark
On a scale of tough criminals, nothin to call me
I'm a rare individual, young and I'm bossy
Guees it come from a rough life, cuffed at night
Lettin' off hot lead that bust from iron pipes
I'm the type that have to shed blood
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs
Fled from the cops 'till when my first joint dropped
I'm still wit my hood, Hollow Point still in the glock
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just gettin' on
So I turned cold, givin 'em hard dick and straight to the hole
Like Rod Strickland, it was takin' it's toll
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hotty to bone
Does she love Escobar, or love Nasir Jones
Let me know so I could cop her the stones
What's clear to me, it's sincerity
Somebody I could call my own, yeah

I been through mad different phases like Masons
to find my way & now I know that happy days are not far away
If I'm strong enough I'll live long enough to see my kids
doing something more constructive with they time
than bids I know because I been there
now I'm in there sit back & look
at what it took for me to get there
First came the ""Howll!!"" the drama with my mama
she got on some fly shit ""What!"" til I split
and said that I'ma be that seed
that doesn't need much to succeed
strapped with mad greed and a heart that doesn't bleed
I'm ready for the world or at least I thought I was
baggin' ""Uhh!"" when I caught a buzz
for thinking about how short I was
Going too fast it wouldn't last but yo I couldn't tell
group homes & institutions, prepare my ass for jail
They put me in a situation forcin' me to be a man
when I was just learnin' to stand without a helpin' hand
Damn, was it my fault, somethin' I did
to make a father leave his first kid at 7 doin' my first bid?
Back on the scene at 14 with a scheme
to get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream
and by all means I will be living high off the hog
and I never gave a ""What!!"" about much but my dog
That's my only ""Howll!"" I had offered my last
Just another little ""Come on!!"" headed nowhere fast
Chorus

That ain't the half ""Arf!"" get's worse as I get older
actions become bolder heart got colder
chip on my shoulder that I dared a ""Uhh!"" to touch
didn't need a click cause I scared a ""Uh huh"" that much
One deep went to for kicks
catchin' vicks throwin' bricks gettin by bein' slick
used to get high to get by used to have to ""Howl!!""
in the morning before I get fly
I ate something a couple of forties made me hate somethin'
I did some ""Arf"" now I'm ready to take something
3 years later showing signs of stress
didn't keep my hair cut or give a ""Come on!"" how I dressed
I'm possessed by the darker side livin' the cruddy life
""What!"" like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
wanna make records but I'm ""Wheeew'd!"" up
I'm slippin' I'm fallin' I can't get up

Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
""Howll!"" was like damn look how that ""how that"" got him
Open like a window no more Indo look at a video
sayin' to myself that could've been yo on the TV
believe me it could be done somethin's got to give
it's got to change cause I've got a son
I've got to do the right thing for shorty
and that means no more getting high drinking forties
So I get back lookin' type slick again
Fake ""What!"" jump back on my ""Uhh uh huh!"" again
Nothin' but love for those that know how it feel
& much respect to all my ""Come on!!"" that kept it real
Be strong kept a from doin' wrong

Man, I told you I lock jaws, carry a glock four
Close my eyes on y'all niggaz, the bullets'll watch yours
Then I gotta open up another can of ass-whippin
Y'all niggaz better pucker up, time for some real ass-kissin
I'm a simple man, I lead a simple life, I mean simple like
I don't need much to be aight, live off the land, eat atnight
Handle whatever's comin when I get there, but I'm good (WHAT?!)
Dismantle whatever's comin, y'all niggaz sit there and put up hoods!
How my niggaz feelin? (GOOD!) How my niggaz like it? (ROUGH!)
What my niggaz want? (BLOOD!) We stay callin niggaz bluff
But if it's got to be, then it's gon' be, c'mon let's eat
Whatever my niggaz want from me, is what my niggaz gonna get from me
And if I ever.. let the words, of another nigga bother me
I might as well.. let the sperm, of that other nigga father me
But they know, like I know, the black Rhino
Niggaz rippin through em and let the nine blow
Nigga die slow! Oh.. oh oh!!
[Chorus 3X]
[DMX]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
What? Ruff Ryders, Volume One, the compilation
DMX, Swizz Beats, uhh, double up
What? Double up, y'all gotta feel us
Y'all GOTTA feel us

Sometimes I wonder what life's about
Sometimes I wonder why the lights are out
Sometimes I wonder why I like to shout
Sometimes I wonder, what the lies are about
Sometimes I see things I shouldn't have seen
Sometimes I wonder why, I'm a hood and a fiend
Sometimes I look at what I've become and cry
Sometimes I, get on that BULLSHIT and be ready to die
Sometimes a nigga that's yo' man might get it
Sometimes even though it's sweet, if you ain't wit it
Sometimes the pain is too much to BEAR
Sometimes it RAINS too much to care
Sometimes if you, don't watch yo' back it'll cost you
Sometimes you wonder, who would give a FUCK if they lost you
Yet sometimes the sun shines around the clock
But sometimes it's dark, and hell is hot

I'm always talking shit, cause wherever I go I walk in shit
And now they got me on some stalking shit
Broad daylight, niggaz is crying, ""But I don't want anyone to blast""
So from the roof I pick em off like a scab
And watch the slug bust a thug like a watermelon
He shoulda thought about that before caught a terror
And now another kid grows up without a daddy or a mommy
Cause at the funeral I hit up the caddy,
it's the army for real niggaz with nothing to lose
Cause when it's time to go you don't get to choose
I make the muthafuckin rules and I enforce it,
shorty's people was loose hand so he lost it
I took the joints and tossed them, in the river,
at the same spot that I dumped
This kid that didn't wanna give a nigga the combo, to the safe in the crib
Look, money, that's why I did what I did
[2 niggaz Talking.....]
[DMX]
Mad stressed and I'm about to have a breakdown
It's time for pops who got the store on the corner to have get a shakedown
He hasn't paid for protection in like two months
So I figured I'd leave him wit like two fronts
I break up shit to let him know that I'm real
Reminder, I know where you live so don't squeal
Told him, next time I come, Have some paper for me
Don't fuck around and turn into another caper for me
Cause though he's cool all that cool shit stops
And I be in the crowd talking bout, ""Yo who killed pops""
It's a shame, he was caught up in the game and couldn't play it
So I smoked him, I asked him ""who's the man"" and made him say it
Three times, and that's how many times I hit him
A nigga was acting like he didn't have to pay so I did him
Yo I think this shit is going to my head (for real)
But let that be a lesson, don't pay dues and you dead
[2 people Talking.....]
[DMX]
A little birdie told me that the feds were on to me
And they wanted to do something real wrong to me
So I broke out, Blazed the L for a while
Checked my sources and found my name was on file
Under gun for hire and extortion, but yo I never use
The same joint twice as a precaution and I heard this kid tried to set me up
He knew I knew so he tried to wet me up
See he was under investigation for drugs
They set up all types of phone taps and bugs
Then when they bagged him, money went out, reprisent (he was my friend)
Said they'd let him go, all he had to do was snitch
And I know now he wish they would have kept him
Cause it was sweet how I crept him, wet him up then left him
And that's for mufuckas that don't know
Go against the grain and you feel the pain
Aight yo

Yo, I be that young fly fellow, got thorough
Down for denaro, hit everything in the Triburo
And I'm the newest member of the Bad Boy team
And I'mma bring this nigga Puff mad more C.R.E.A.M.
With hooks galore, leave this city shook for short
And I'mma take 'em back where Biggie took 'em before
You stay a playa'
Since you can't stay up with the Pope
And stick to what you do best, stick to wearin' coke
You lookin' for excuses, ways to say you're broke
Can't keep a whip, cuz you can't pay the note
Fuck the side, I'm waiting for you on top, Mercedes drop
Black 380's cops, 'till the day I get knocked
All I ask when I die, dress me fly and neatly
And brush my waves so I'm handsome when the bitches greet me
Word from the wise, niggas jerk pies, we hurt them guys
Bust lead, to skin they head and leave them circumcised
So how you wanna settle this
Rappin' or on some ghetto shit
We can do it yo way, with mics or with metal shit
[1] - [DMX]
Niggas wanna shout, I'mma make noise
Niggas run they mouth, I'mma break jaws
Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours
Harlem World uptown baby, we make wars

Mase is comin' out, we gon' take yours

Yo, yo before it's all over, lot of blood gon' be spilled
We ain't discriminatin' even thugs gon' be killed
We early inheritors , born into C.R.E.A.M
If a nigga' get sheist then we form as a team
Bullshit if you want and it be on for this C.R.E.A.M.
The weatherman don't even know the storm I'mma bring
But yo, I'm not the man with whom you interact
So before you grab gatts to jack, remember that
You take dough from Mase, you might as well send it back
I got thugs everywhere, where you going spending that
When clicks come to brawl, everything I hit fall
Niggas play sick wid y'all, wit me they ain't sick at all
No matter how big or small, I get rid of ya'll
And shit I spit at y'all, come in one size fit all
[Repeat 1]
[Mase]
Yo, yo if you think I'm on some sweet shit
Then won't you creep quick, I let the heat spit
Make a nigga ""G"" flick, classic criminal
Keep a gatt by my genitals, thugs love me
So don't get splashed for the minimal
We never vest up, be in a double breast tux
Plus keep a fresh cut, picture me getting lefts stuff
I let one lose, to show you I ain't the one do
And I ain't puffin' nuthin', make all my gun shoot
You let your gun loose, none o' 'em niggas gun proof
Watch them niggas drop, when I pop one in they sunroof
And we be lead bustin', leavin' niggas head gushin'
You niggas talkin' 'bout guns like you said something
I'll be lacin' 'em, hollow tips, I be wastin' 'em

Uh, I got to remind y'all niggas
What the flow is all about
Huh, its about this
Anywhere from forty-eight and up
Straight, you feel me?
Fifty fifty
Aiyyo, I gots to hear the beat so I can eat, ahight?
If I can't live, you can't live, ain't nothin sweet
Bitch ass niggas think its all about Versace
A week later them niggas talkin about (Yo, X got me)
I thought he was my man, but he act like he ain't know me
I knew he had the joint, but I didn't wanna make him show me
That nigga be buggin, stickin cats up and random
Doing his dirt and disappearin like the phantom
Niggas can't stand him, but ask me if I care
'Cuz what I used to give a fuck about, just ain't there
And ain't nothing fair, I knew this for a long time
Thats why with ever wrong crime comes anotha strong rhyme
And thats mo' time under the belt, you felt what I had
And I shouldn't have even done it, thats what made this shit sad
I'm doin' bad, but if I gots to feel it, you gots to feel it
And if a nigga can't afford it, I gots to steal it
And that's how real it, GETS, when this shit
You still tryin to get the man, first catch up with the man
Then we gon' see what'choo made of
If your shit ain't pumpin Kool-Aid, what you afraid of?
The monster under the bed, fill ya with four slugs to the head
Or ya babies mother missin for a month, found dead
Worms comin' from places you stuck ya dick in
Maggots got the bitch coverered and the smells sick'nen
Plastic don't hide the smell for too long, I do wrong
And so I don't have nightmares I forget about it, move on
Keep gettin my groove on, 'cuz that shit could fuck with'choo
Keep dwellin on it, and its gonna get stuck with you
Niggas try their luck with you, 'cuz they smell ass
And money if you pussy, I'm gonna be able to tell fast
Some cop I'm about to smack across the face in this robbery
I'm on a robbin spree, and ain't no STOPPIN ME
On this real, thats why a nigga stay writin
'Cuz kid this shit is real, what you think we play fightin
You must of saw som'thin funny, or never saw som'thin bloody
Or you don't know I'll bring it to your door 'cuz I'm cruddy
Like puddy, when I hold you niggas, I mold you niggas
I done told you niggas, that I been owed you niggas
For that shit you did that you wasnt built for
Shit I guess you didnt know you do get killed for
I done filled niggas up with the extended clip
Its like I blew this joint down with the extended rip
Or that non-stop, when the bomb drops
I'ma take it from where you at and then end up on ya moms block
From here to Comstock, niggas gettin bust wild
?Cell cagers last night from lock out just died?
Ain't no where to hide, ain't no wear to run
What more can they do to a man that ain't been done
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
Especially if its all over the place, your mind all over his face
How do brains taste, when they mixed with gun powder
Semi to fully automatic makes the gun louder
I got som'thin to fix pain when I kicks game
'Cuz I'ma float off more tracks than they sixth train
You 'bout to get flamed, from ash to ashes to DIRT
You gon' go with the dough that your life was worth
MOTHERFUCKER...

In the name of Jesus
I can have everything good of the earth be given to me by him
In the name of Jesus
There would be never be a time that I have to fight the devil and I cannot win
In the name of Jesus
I lose all strong holds that the devil had over my life
In the name of Jesus
When I save a thousand two or save ten
So I thank the lord for my wife
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you what you showed me what you told me
In the name of Jesus
I want to thank you for your love and watchin over me
In the name of Jesus
I don't have to, go through what I went through anymore
In the name of Jesus

You gave me the book, so now I just look when I need the word
In the name of Jesus
You took, a crook, gave him a new look now he speaks the word
In the name of Jesus
It don't matter what we did tell it to the lord and he forgives
Whatever it was right or wrong
I'm a catch up with the herd then I'm comin home
In the name of Jesus
I ran away for far too long starve too long
In the name of Jesus
Where people perish for lack of knowledge
They all too strong let's get it on

I realize I'm a sinner
I repent my sins and right this moment am a beginner
Baby in the spirit, let me go
In the name of Jesus please let me go!!!! (Come on!)

You saved my life a thousand times (Saved a thousand times)
Gave me a dream that came to be
Opened my eyes so I could see

I had my ups and had my downs
Until you turned my life around
And I want the whole world to see
They don't know what you mean to me

They got my back to the wall
Nobody to turn to, nobody I can trust
I used to have friends
But all I could think about was hustlin
That was then, this is now
And this is how I must be
A loose cannon, with a cannon
Nobody can trust me
When half the world is sayin ""Fuck Me""
The other half will fear me
Shit both halves will make one whole
But nothing can dare those cowards to come near me
Yeah they hear me, but fuck that
I want them cats to feel me
Cuz to feel me, is to know I'll be a problem till they kill me
It's from sun-up to sun-down
Got my gun up, and I'ma run down
On any ass coward that feelin that I can't get down
I'm a nightmare, the nigga that's always right there
Borderline, with two lines, a little too heavy to fight fair
Unload, reload, cock back, and pop that
And drag to where your top at
And guaranteed that I dropped that
You can't top that
I'm here to put them rumors to rest
Fuck the past
Fuck the present
I'm the future in the flesh
[Chorus x2]
I'm the chrome before the storm
I'm the buzz before the storm
I'm the screech before the crash
I'm the click before the blast
I'm the rise before the fall
I'm the loss before the gain
Vacant Lot will keep it hot
Cuz we the future of this game
[Big Stan]
Coke game to sober
We takin rap over
Either roll with us or you gettin rolled over
But pardon, niggaz is too hard for your squadron
Evacuate the buildin, save all the women and children
No way around it, niggaz comin in thousands
M17s, grenades, and four-pounders
All you grimmy niggaz get the fuck from round us
Y'all the same cock-housers from the blocks to gouchers
Celebratin is the the feelin when I catch a fake vilian
Send him brick style in the ceilin of an abandonded building
Feel me y'all got to, I'm the voice of theory
My advice keep rappin you ain't no where near me
Spillin blood for the dead, God bless them dearly
And look straight to the heavens so I know that He hear me
My shit fluxuate from the drop seven, to the wide bodied eight
Up on in corner, with the sweeper I let the body gate
[Chorus x2]
[DMX]
When I do niggaz, it's how I do niggaz
And two niggaz got nothin for me
When they saw me looked the other way and tried to ignore me
I put holes, like foot holes, in niggaz buttholes
Stomp a mudhole, when I cut hoes, the fuckin blood flows
That was bustin niggaz wide, I was 10 when I died
Now I'm walkin dead with the infared by my side
Keepin niggaz in line like a parade
Then they scatter like roaches when they get sprayed with Raid
Like a grenade, playin with spades is the plan
Now what part of suck my dick don't you understand
Better act like you know or get smacked like your hoe
When you straped, toe to toe, but can't strap with the flow
And I gets down for mine, with the crime
And if I gots to do time, fuck it
I don't mind
I handle my business and I shoot snitches
Cuz I know nowadays niggaz is more ass than loose bitches
It's all good, I'm still out
Knock on wood, robbin niggaz like my last name is Hood
Cuz I could, go with that mob that goes out to rob
That mad scheme to get cream without the job
I house more niggaz than a shelter
And if a nigga ever felt a, heltah skeltah
It'd would melt away, cuz the pain is too much to bear
Let the dead be dark while the Dark is here

Yo
I ain't fuckin' with this nigga, no more
Word to my mother
Fuck 'em, so ya know 'em for sure
Word to my brother
It's like he's gotten worse than before
Son of I wonder
What type of dirt this nigga got in store for me to get under
Then I get a call
Yo!
(X, Luis just killed your cousin, underneath the projects
Don't get back, them niggaz will pay, then I got you, told you I got you
Yo, I got you)
I'm in a catch 22
But them niggaz gotta pay
But I know he's gonna be askin' for a favor one day
But fuck it
I ain't got no choice in the matter
Them faggets killed my peep
And I wanna see him splatter
(That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, we ain't on no bitch hit
And use the same gun that you killed them 2 kids with
Is that hard to live with?)
Nah
(See, you still a playa)
But what you want from me?
(Uh...I'll tell you later)
Chorus
Shit is all over the news
Bomb goes off in central
What the fuck have I gotten myself into?
My mental is like
Get the fuck outta there
I'm out
(Hey, goin' somewhere?)
Nah
(What the bag for?)
Fuck it, what you want?
(Can a nigga come inside for a minute, and puff a blunt?)
Here we go again
(After what I just gave you, with you actin' like that
when you asked for that favor)
Yo, I ain't ask you for shit
(Oh yes you did, when you really needed something, and you was out, you did
You sold me your soul, when you didn't say no
Just let a nigga go, and give me what you owe
Fuck what you think, ain't shit for free
And a mothafucker you know, can't defeat me)
Forgive me father, for I have sinned
And with your help I know, the devil won't win

Here we are on our way to hell
We're gonna do it, and we do it well

and a small piece of your nose and, bone from your arm
which they really couldn't tell apart, because of the bomb
I could be waitin, camped out in yo' car, in the backseat

It's all over now, I don't wanna talk to niggaz
Popping shots like corks in niggaz, sticking forks in niggaz
Cause they done, only reason y'all still breathing is cause y'all run
When we bust shots, my nigga clutch glocks
Right in front of precents fuck cops
niggaz want pops then they die for them
Kiss the barrel, cry for them
Spirt leave your body touch the sky for them
Fuck voltron see what me and mines form
In the nine storm, death times gone
I'm that cat that y'all niggaz got your eyes on
Go to papi broke trying to get your pies on
The day that I'm gone I'm real fuck stardom
niggaz wanna talk but they don't want no problems

Acting like you really wanna bark back don't push me

It's my shit here, FUCK that nigga just say try shit where
Come on cupcake y'all cats ain't even built like that
I been seen through they bullshit I'm real like that
I know how to walk the dog, I know how to chase the cat
I know how to get a bone, I know how to bring it back
I know how to flip on a nigga split him with the bat
I know how to train a pup to make sure they scratch
You motherfuckers don't want no problems cause my revolver is solving them
One by one until it's all of them

Keep your fucking mouth shut if your mans want spit, nigga

Don't you test me boy
Don't fuck with X or Drag to the dash
Cause once you dump in these bags you drag to the trash
Dumpster amoung the rest of them fags
My poker got your skin looking like acupunctures
Keep a silence on the tip can't afford the noise
My banger got a jagged edge like them four boys
If your hot i'll super soak you, won't be able to dry it off
Just relax take you last breath and die it off
Nothing but love I spread
But if you take advantage the weight that's lead will rush your head
You sweat'll die your hair red, like my bitch Eve

[Verse 1: Mic Geronimo]
I format my mind for combat
In fact I put a hole up in your back on the song like that
Rollin thick with my people ain't no room to breathe
Surrounded by murderous felons, drinks and bags of weed
I swing at ya and get fly with the M-I
I'm automatic trample in your static with the semi
So when I squeeze I'm off in the breeze with these
Licking shots at them whack MC's
With no direction, I rhyme with perfection skills
Drug a nigga like a pill when it's time to build
Keep it real, get your head rocked when I wreck shop
I bigger with my style ain't a bully on your fuckin block
Word is bond I go on
I'm breaking MC's with vocal tones over real rap songs
Insane in the brain nothing left to gain
Grab the mic up with skill when it's time to build, Mother Fuckers

Niggas increase the pain when they shout my name
Horrified by the thought of hot slugs and graves
Cause Ja is a sinister character loading that 44 caliber
Infrared aimed at your jugular
Who the fuck are you Nobody cares
You just be another nigga that needs repairs
Talking to all them niggas shitting
And all them faggots that be steady bitching, inside their insides twitching
Sod sill delivering, DOA push a nine to your mind and commence the spray
No bullshit, Natural's the king of left
Scared of life but wanna play the game of death
What's next Niggas wearing padded kotex
Pussy ass MC's get treated like rough sex
I'm possessed you can't feel what I feeler
Be easy on the cut, uh, uh, uh

Yeah, fresh on the scene-a with the fucking next niggas demeanor
You know my work I bless and press more skirts then the cleaners
I'm damn relaxed cause you cats can't stress the G
Ain't a enough jump in 'em to make you high enough to test me
Gone, niggas is moist like Duncan Heinz
Choice when I'm voicing my poise I got poison lines
So flame on I turn my game on the expert
Niggas get chills when you hear my name on the network
Fuck what you niggas kickin on the mic
You chicken like you don't know what an ass whippin feels like
I'm living flashbacks, I blaze niggas split like ass-cracks
It's the J to the A, smoother than jazz tracks, yeah
So when I'm browsing through your housing projects
Niggas get 5,000 shit is rough
Time to close I hit you with 16 of those
Next time maybe more, but who the fuck knows

Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo, Check it out yo
I'm peeling niggas caps like oranges
Hit 'em in the head with 2 by 4 inches
I'm a grimy nigga so I like my bitches cruddy
My clothes dirty, dick shitty, and my knife bloody
I did too much dirt to turn back now
I'm the reason my lil' sister smoking crack now
I'd feel guilty if I had a heart but I don't
To live a carefree life if I stop killing but I won't
It's in my blood to destroy man kind
With every murder I lose it little more of my damn mind
And I ain't got much left to lose nigga ,so don't snooze nigga
I'm telling yous nigga, just pay your dues nigga
Respect my mother fucking style of rap
Murder your mic and your unborn child
This ain't wild just how niggas living on the street
A little something that cant be beat

And the click-click from the calico, I gotta go,
make it pimp with a lot of hoes
I'm the same muthafucka that's countin' that dough,
cookin' that coke to a pot of gold
Cause my rainbow, is every color top that crackhead cop,
I don't care I gotta cap me a cop
As long as I got enough money to cop me a drop, pop enough glocks
Drag open up boots by watchin' co-op's in convo at condos
Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep up on me
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me
And the only on leavin' is me
And the only one bleedin' is you, tryin' to breeze with me
All the Roc is E-N-Y-C-E, in the NYC with the white T
All I really do is
R-U-double F, R-Y-D-E, D-R-A-G, to the dash O-N
Catch me, smokin' potent, bet it leave y'all, niggaz soakin',
with your insides open
[Chorus: Twista (Drag-On) (2x)]
[Swizz Beatz:]
ERRRRRRR!!!!
Hold the fuck up!
Slow down!
Drag, Twista, listen up
These muthafuckaz don't know what's real out here
(They damn sure don't)
This is volume 2 (volume 2)
Nigga, so, get ignorent!
[Chorus: Twista (Drag-On)]
[Twista]
Whether murder or bouncy beat, my flow be philosophical
Smokin' on tropical, achievin' all missions impossible
When I up the block at you, I'ma pop at you
If your momma cry there's nothin' I could do
Should not've fucked with Mr. Illogical
When I'm in to clubbin', clubbin', shake it don't you break it
You booty to shapey, can't take it, wanna see you naked
I don' drunk a boo muthafucka, so you know I'm lit up
Everybody get up, spin witha a Twista, it's a stick up
[Drag-On (Swizz Beatz):]
This where the shit pick up, let me load this clip up,
lust pour me some liquor, Flame-On and Twista,
let's see if you murdered who'll miss ya
I love the dirty south, that's why I gotta dirty mouth
that'll burn you out
Tell your bitch I got a dick that'll turn her out,
especially when I tell her turn around
I don' hurt her now
Shit'll come back, and I think it's time to get murdered now
I'm tired of silly clowns, spittin' out weak shit, sound like my shit
You gon' make me pull a all nighter
Standin' infront of your crib with that gasoline and that lighter
Now hit, we won't miss ya, Drag-On and Twista
(Puttin' it on 'em!)

[DMX]
Uhh (huh) yeah, it is what it is
Yah'mean?  We untouchable baby
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson]
I keep my song in my soul
Blessed my heart and made it go
Tops of our heads to tips of our toes
We're untouchable
Everyday the sun'll shine
Took this dream and made it mine
I'm gettin down one thing that I know (WHAT!)
We're untouchable
[DMX]
We built this Double R thing from the ground up
Another principle of when it's beef, niggaz round up
Gettin down like what nigga, YO!
That's all it takes and it's like, HERE WE GO!
Thorough type niggaz that control the streets
Rollin deep, holdin heat, don't even think about sleep
When we creep, niggaz goin down for the count
It ain't sweet, fuck around and knock money out
C'mon fella, you don't want the dog with the camp
Not Old Yeller, a pitbull and dog is the champ
You know better, think about crossin the line
Hit your sweater, with about ten from the .9
Double R and we get down for life!
Let a nigga KNOW we can go down tonight
From the tops of our heads, the tips of our toes
WHAAAAT!  We untouchable, AIGHT?
Yea, WHAT!
[Chorus]
[Cross]
Yea, yeah, YEAH!  Be strong..
I represent the have and the have-nots
All the niggaz with the weed spots
And all my niggaz on them cell blocks
We gon' R-U-double-F R-Y-D-E
You can't fuck with my army
My niggaz is untouchable, eatin niggaz like Lunchable
.45 be crushin you when the bullets be touchin you
Paul bearers'll carry you
to the cemetary where your momma gon' bury you
Black suit be fittin you nigga, I got hood degrees
Plus I'm street like powder, milk, and government cheese
If you a runnin man nigga, then I'ma shoot up your knees
Then it's me against the world, man against machine
S.D.T.S. - stick to my routine
My knuckle game impeccable, crack game incredible
Lawyers for my niggaz who be sittin in the Federal
Nigga, I'm untouchable
[Chorus]
[Infa-Red]
Lyrically I'm, untouchable..
Infa-Red nigga, let's go..
All I can know is 365 days of pain
My name, how to sell cocaine
And I was taught to buy guns so big when I go to the roof
I can aim and shoot down a plane
Infa-Red's my name but fuck all that
Fall back and witness how the streets made me the grimiest nigga alive
I sell you a fake pie, shoot out your fake eye
Give niggaz a break, nah; I gotta chase mine
Don't wear your watch around me nigga I take time
Like niggaz that them blue tried to like
I turn men to mice, canary yellow my ice
And Ruff Ryde on anybody, to be precise
But I handle my business like I'm supposed to
When you go in the precinct, that's the only time you see my poster
But I could post up and get rid of my pieces
I own collies sellin rocks the size of Domino pizzas
I'm untouchable, nigga
[Chorus]
[Sheek]
Double R.. whoo!  All day..
Yo, aiyyo X let me get 'em daddy - yo, yo, yo
U-N-T-O-U-C-H, A-B-L-E-S
Sheek the new Elliott Ness (no doubt)
Nigga, Bloodline, D-Block; two of the best
Hang the Double R chain from the side of the car
Drive by and put your brains on the side of the bar
Sheek heavy in the hood (uh-huh)
And I don't mean cause I gained weight in the hood (nah)
My aim is good, aiyyo X what they want it to be here?
Our hammer's cocked, outside of the house on the lawn chair
Yeah nigga what?  The new rap LeBron's here
Get 'em dog, we the new America's nightmare
And we don't say much, we just get it on
That's why we don't get touched, y'all like a dutch
Hands all on you, I'm tryna warn you
to stay in your place, so you don't get laced
And them pretty ass shades, can stay on your face
[Chorus]
[Drag-On]
Uhh, uhh, uhh, c'mon!
You motherfuckers got me back on my grizzly, I'm back on the grind
I'm back to the streets, catch a beef, come back with the nine
I'll murder ya man, come back with his shines
I tote two guns, I don't care if you box, I don't care if you blind
I spit in your eye like niggaz is eatin, I'm splittin the pies
Frank Nitty your rap, how gritty am I?  The city is mine
Yeah, you get in my way I pity your moms
Yeah, my block is real, my niggaz is armed
My borough is thorough, we bang with each other
I'm switchin my diamonds and changin the color
with change of weather, canary in the sun, uhh
I bury ya nigga then bury the gun, X whattup?
Me and you is untouchable (uh-huh)
We both had bricks they couldn't sniff cause the coke was uncrushable
Guns is fingerprint-proof, we ""Ryde or Die""
You drivin by, we clap at your ride, good-bye

Know the G, hah hah, know the face
Hah hah, know the name nigga, hah
C'mon, yeah, yeah
Now who could do it like the M-I-C, y'all niggaz ain't about this life
Runnin up inside of the crib to cut your lights
My A.R. likes the thug life, drugs and gun fights
White on whites, menage and dykes, and nice ice
White wraps for these niggaz who scrap and gun clap
Stick up kids, leavin y'all with two in the back
Once you bitch-made niggaz started doin the rap
Seven figure shit really started ruinin rap
Take it back to hood shit bulletproof and biscuits
Chips all for hustle and grams go from bricks
And whips for templates, we switch while we movin all of this weight
'til we screamin all of us hate
[Chorus: Mic Geronimo]
You see shit's still real
Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggaz try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel
So fuck what you feel and shit's still real
Nothin ever change cause we still in the field
Niggaz try to front but the game's too real
We don't give a fuck bout the way you feel
So fuck what you feel, yeah
[Big Stan]
Y'all niggaz better get the guns
Fuck the pep talk, I don't wanna hear it
When it's on it's on, talkin I don't feel it
That's the fake shit, argue and just make shit hot
And with my short fuse I'm always quick to make shit pop
Nigga respect this, catch me on the block and with gloves
I'm ambidextrous, sold with the glock and the snub
But I ain't reckless, with me it's always one big dot
then one big shot, and one kid drops
Head shot, closed lid over one big box
And a preacher left prayin over one big plot
Never a mess, now I wanna conquer the world
And I'ma do it, wanna know how?  Fuckin with Earl
He's the one that took me in to raise the dog from a pup
With his guidance, help create a beast from a mutt
Just released from the cut goin straight for the neck
B.S., Bloodline, what the fuck you expect nigga?
[Chorus]
[DMX - overlapping Chorus]
Uhh, WHAT?!  Uhh
Uhh, uhh, uhh

It's time to take out the garbage, y'all niggaz want the hard shit
I got shit that'll start shit, rip apart shit and disregard shit
Thought it wasn't real no more, just because I got a deal
What you think, I ain't gon' steal no more?
""Usual Suspects"" once again - thus begins
the bullshit we both went through form trusted friends
Bustin him from where?  (It's time to peel)
Fuck what you heard baby!  Shit's still real
Y'all niggaz think your shit don't stink, cause it don't think
Hit a motherfuckin iceberg your ship won't sink
Bitch don't blink, cause I'ma hit you with somethin
I'ma hit you for frontin, I'ma hit you for nuttin? You buggin
I'm lovin it - the obstacles that I go through

What! Niggaz can't fuck with us
DMX:
Get at me dog. My niggaz
Styles:
That's my word!
Verse One: DMX
I'm the type to kick back and look at shit
'cause crooked shit gets me amped
And what you don't know  will get you locked in sleep away camp.
Grand champ and raise more hell  than a Sorrel
See you at the peephole  bustin' at the doorbell
Though I wasn't coming without mine
You put me on the front line because you doubt mine
Bet your and lost yours, you come to get your I tossed yours
And it cost yours, fuck y'all niggaz stupid, I'm the boss dog
What more dirt must I do, plus my crew
Busts at you, and you be like ""What's that oooh""
What's that Clue, do I bring the noise what
Destroy these mutts, is these niggaz toys or what
Bring all the pretty niggaz thinking they shitty, what a pity
Lemme show them niggaz shitty some pity, but for fifty
A motherfucker will get a bullet to hum to him, put the gun to him
Hit 'em with something that comes to him, bet it runs through him
Look at what I done to him, no more smiles
Got the whole top half of his head, running wild
But you don't hear me though, so I turn out the lights
We can take it to the streets dog, turn off the mics
If you want war, then you want more, than you can stand
And this 44, will leave you with your dick in the sand
Who the man, and now you cats know for real
Get at me dog, (bark), what the deal
Verse Two: Styles
Y'all niggaz fucking with the L.O.X.
Your stuck on a rock
Got that Alcatraz flow
You just don't know
Lifetime kid caged in blazin'
Any type of rapper or federal agent
Paniro the made man, blade man
Stand up type of guy, your living a lie
Niggaz wanna be pretty and fly but kiddies will die
The dogs run the city, bet fifty on mine
Two grams for you to sniff, how silly am I
Got a lot of jokes don't, kill yo ass won't I
Maybe not if the spot is filled up with po 9
Many niggaz get it confused, blame the rules
Only ask the how's not the who's
Better off busting your tool, then we might get the crew
But as far as rap goes, you a motherfucking fool
If you don't want chips, you should have stayed in school
You and 8-ball nigga, you wanna play pool
I'll put you in the side pocket, look at the size of my rocket
Styles don't lie, cop the work then clock it
Boxes full of boots, jeans, suits and watches
Niggaz don't pump if they can't make a profit
Stop it, before we pull it back then cop it
Vacant lot niggaz come through then we lock it
(WHAT, WHAT, WHAT)
Verse Three: Jadakiss
With no glocks I'm in your town with five locks
Take five blocks, come back with five trucks, with knots
It's the L.O.X, three niggaz that listen and watch
And nigga you know, whenever we spit, it's hot
It be that new flow, my niggaz, fly niggaz
Always high niggaz, ready to die niggaz
As far as I'm hearing, y'all doing a lot of comparing
Lemme get the one clearance like a sample
'Kiss is the champ and I know that you don't wanna get stamped
Left somewhere cramp, so when it rains, you get damp
Niggaz is done, since poppy raised his son
When bringing in drums, to bring all g's to bums
Whether you can flow or not ain't the issue
You don't Jay to kiss you, his lyrics pierce the gristle
Take a puff then a swig
Think about how I'm gonna
hold it down for Big, my motherfucking nig
Your money is low, and your flow been late
While I be coming through with new shit with tint plates
The only higher than money, is respect
The only thing hotter than my click, is a tek
So when I hit you with these last bars around your neck
You gonna know never to fuck around with L-O-X nigga
(WHAT, YEAH)
Verse Four: Sheek Luchion
My bank account be doubling
While you niggaz stay in trouble and
L.O.X. stay fly
Three niggaz jig-I
Shit you never seen before, Feds hit the repo law
Kingpin, 10 mil. each of us popular
It's Sheek baby
Chicks hate to see me on the Soul Train
With Don Cornelius
And all they got is alias
To work with
To catch Sheek, y'all niggaz besta work quick
Now that I'm eating right, plus living well
So nowadays when I burp, it's fettucini you smell
Ain't that right poppa-san, used to push a Nissan
With a black master full 850 full suspension
While you collect your pension, I ain't worked in years
My stomach is fat from Puerto Rican food, while yours is scarce
Small black haired, chinky-eyed Puerto Rican mama
Keep them laced in the scadda, half the closet on product
I learn things, just by watching y'all niggaz make the wrong moves
Now I know what not to do, to make more than y'all fools
Y'all think we ignorant, 'cause we don't budge unless we benefit
Cats that take the light that's scarce and see what's at the end of it
P.H. me, because a nigga wisks me up in Jake B.
Your shit be so-so, low pro.
On a bus before the cars show
On some old joystick shit, no mirrors
I can see behind me through the cameras
Flip plates, make the whole block go bananas

Yo, I leave jail smoothly, jump in the pale hooptie
Fuck the dick-suckin-ass nigga male groupies
Diplomats, you look at alliance, you shook in defiance
I'm cookin up coke, lookin for clients
I got the AK, SK, 40 cal
Scope red on your head still 40 thou' (40 thousand)
Worse than files of {?} turf burstin blaow
Give the church my child, ask to nurture thou
Cause I've seen the hearses now
But if this was Gilligan's Isle, Thirstin Howl, wow
Look at his kicks, they worth a thou'
Isn't it sad, do what I say and wish that you had
You Michigan crabs, you stabbed you piss in a bag
Or worse than that, zipped in a bag
Broke to fractions, a division of math
From, Hollywood, shittin on Shaft, we go hard
Killa Killa Killa, Killa uh uhh
[DMX]
KILLA!
X and Killer Cam, Dark Man X, once again - PULL IT!
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, UHHHHHHH!

Step lightly around dawg (YEA!) I might be hittin town dawg (YEA)
You really tryin to get down dawg?
Only thing I can do with pussy is fuck it
And I would tell you to suck my dick but you might suck it
See y'all niggaz the cat type (WHAT?)
You still a baby get your ass wiped (WHAT?)
Must I take a nigga's last stripe? (c'mon!)
Youse a bitch, now more bitch than a bitch
Still a bitch fuckin bitch, you been a bitch
Know how we do, run up, in a bitch
Peep the crib, run up, in it quick (yea!)
Everything breathin stops; only thing my niggaz is leavin

Let me catch you on the block, bitch-ass niggaz is cowards
Done fucked around and dropped the soap in the shower (C'MON!)

Fuck the Prince of Bel-Air!
I'm known to sell heir, got game like a politician

Run up on you B, and leave your seat damp!

Spit rays, pop off C's and graze niggaz fades
I creep in a Mustang, bust my heat in the rain
Till they get a rust stain
Y'all niggaz heard of me, probably wanna murder me
I'll pull up on ya block and turn your white teeth burgundy
Let's see some surgery

Watch the first lady as she rides
Rougher than the rest of them bitches
What it take for cats to hush they mouth
This one official
Come on clown prove it's still an issue
Streets is ours, have ya homies weepin cause they miss you
Thought it was a game when I said the dogs would get you

And I don't want the drop coupe so I'm choppin the wagon
Dark navy blue six speed, six air-bags
Even if this shit crash, feel like Six Flags
And ya'll niggaz cant block my shells
When I'm in jail the C.O. don't lock my cell
Before any rap group, we was the L.O.X. crooks
I'll slap a hundred dollars on the whole blocks books
And know the block shook, when I walk by
Niggaz just like you they rather not look
I inspired y'all niggaz to flow
I'ma always get money so I admire ya'll niggas that blow
Ask ya self who the nicest out right now
Put your ice up lets get on the mic right now
Clown, I'm the top cat where it stops at
Where lightning and thunder at
And y'all niggaz is under that

If you runnin with the P. you gonna get your turn
Tuck my gun while its hot to feel my dick hair burn
Might come through the spot where the shottie and what
Body to block and hot wanna the Bacardi wit rocks

Hope the Lord got your soul cause your ass is mine
Every time you turn around niggas know that I be right there
East turned to West coast, cravin for the nightmare
Don't give a fuck about what you sling
Cause you ain't slingin that shit, or bringin that shit
Up the hill, but you still singin that shit
Talkin shit like you know what its like to walk this shit
Get on some stalkin shit
So you know what niggaz rule New York and shit
I'm just thinkin all the business and how to handle ya'll niggaz
All the families that I got lightin candles for niggaz
Breathin revelence, grandmothers fallen out and need the sedatives
Mom huggin the casket wishin that she raised a better kid

Let 'em know it ain't a sweet walk
This gon' be
The only joint made this year that'll knock 'til 2003
And y'all gon' see
That the hottest nigga out there, was, is, and will be me
Just like that
I can go away for a minute, do some other shit, but bounce right back
And when it's on
I'm comin strapped, with some shit that'll spit from dusk 'til dawn
And when you gone
Ain't no comin back in the morning, like that shit was a dream
Nigga you gone

Bring the noise
And you better come with niggas you don't give a fuck about,
Cuz you gone lose your boys
Cuz we don't play
And the silencer will silence any cocksucker with somethin to say
Dog for life
Whether I'm on or off the leash I bite, streets are my life
Click click boom {*gunshot*}
Another life taken too soon, another mother had a funeral
Still waters run deep
And the pain is forever alive inside, makes it hard to sleep
But I keep goin, goin
Shit I'm always careful when I walk, I'm always seein, knowin
The dog gone live
Stay walkin the wire, over the fire, when I can I give
The dog is good
And how it's stayin dog gone fuck with the hood
The dog fuck with the wood

Empty a clip of hollow tips into yo' daughter's face

When I don't see, nuttin but SOFT in a nigga
Fuckin coward, I wonder how it - feels
To have to look at your moms - squeal, after I hit her with the steel

Believe whoever I hit up, will never get up

But it's a different story any time we meet in the streets
I'm fully in it bitch, your shit is juvenile to me
We can squash it, go 'head let you warm up the crowd for me
I hate to even be like this, y'all bring it out
To tell the truth it excites me, I scream it out

Up North I hit my niggaz off with good smoke
Out West they ridin with me, now I'm back hard
I'm just worried bout the rats that's in my back yard
Hated by many, confronted by none

I'm the type to follow the cops wit a midget drivin me
Make them think the car drivin itself, and I'm in the passenger seat

Drag dash, I'm happy to be
On, this rap shit is like a jacket to me
I wear it with cracks in my sleeves
So I keep it on, don't never take my jacket off cuz my shit be gone
What are you, lost your mind?
It took my time to cut these dimes
So I could dump drug a few minds, so don't make me bust a few nines

Hate chips that go away, lookin like white coke
Sit in the sun long, come back like french toast
Hair was up, now is down, eyes are black, now is brown
Used to frown, now you smile, nigga must have left you now
Went from bikes to the car, from the cars to the boat
Went from keys to the coke, went from coke to the dope
Went from cracks to the raps, went from bats to the gats
Went from slums to the stats, been to London and back
Me change cuz I rap, I can't do it
I went from muggin y'all to payin niggas to do it

Just avoid a bad situation
What you got to prove?
Leave her be
Chicken squakin hatin frequently
Manic Man is obsessed
And Stalkin me
If he
Icy enough, I'm pricin his stuff
Be nicy enough
To let him spin, I'm callin ya bluff
Puttin it down
Ruff Ryders puttin they work
Snatched up the illest viscous pittbull in a skirt
Makin em hurt
Haters steady dishin up dirt
Changin the game, settin the rules
Makin it work, uh
CHORUS
Leavin em scared
Mami takin all of this here
All of this fame I'm hungry
Hope you cats is prepared
Niggas, set me up
And Imma take it and run
Think its a game
Just check out how my format is done
Stalkin ya shine
And I do it to perfection
Made a promise everytime I touch the mic
To bless em
Used to tease me how I keep is greezy
Just to test em
Eve handcuff niggas but I don't arrest em
Shorty bang
Hear the niggaz sayin
Shout my name
Make the thugish niggas scream
Watchin me entertain
Dicks brick when I like the lips
Just keepin it plain
Fantasizin about this bitch
Got em goin insaine
Oooh's and ahhh's
5'7"" thick in the thighs
Every thugs dream wife
See the love in they eyes

Whole package make her a dime

Nokio:

When Im in Miama I go to scoop Luke
To see the peep show and hit the duke shoot
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex coup
Up in ""Harlem World"" in my Timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took is to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnell and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now Im bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex

Run wit my niggas that aint got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but cant stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crop scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, heres the topic

Y'all .. niggas is duckin me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldnt talk you wouldnt walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin shit wearing a fuckin' chain

And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesnt mind doing time

Empty out, reloaded and throw more slugs
How you gonna explain fuckin a man?
Even if we squashed the beef, I ain't touchin ya hand
I don't buck with chumps, for those to been to jail
That's the cat with the Kool-Aid on his lips and pumps
I don't fuck with niggaz that think they broads
Only know how to be ONE WAY, that's the dog

For the mothers that really do love em, please pray for these cats
Cuz I know niggaz is hardheaded but I ain't got the patience
Don't want me havin no patience turn into more patience

Tryna get away with shit a real nigga wouldn't do

GET EM BOY! (RIGHT THERE) That's how we do... (AIIGHT THEN)

Shove ya head up ya ass, have you seein shit clearly
Never heard that D be runnin, cuz D be gunnin

WHAT! Uhh, DMX nigga
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still wanna get near me - fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin - from the floor, to the ceilin
Straight through the roof, want the truth
I kinda miss robbin and stealin
cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin when I starved
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard
Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (WHY)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin was a lie
If I ain't shit then, why should I try
See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough
The Devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
as yours are what's mine, define, revolvin doors (nigga!)

let me ask my niggaz (why)
My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we Gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
and keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggaz (why)

They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here
I look to the air, I ask God, ""Love me please,""
but in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They wanna, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin
I was told I'd amount to nothin, most of my childhood
Like () it was stuntin my growth
Seperated me from the shit I was wantin the most
Felt myself comin close to pumpin them O's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders,
tryin to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words nigga my will was weak
Please feel what I speak,
this ain't your average ordinary jargon
weak rap niggaz be talkin
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, til we meet niggaz
[Chorus w/ minor variations]
[Busta Rhymes]
I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your FUBU sweater
like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin
on a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for
with every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
the demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
for my kids with a legacy for my CHILDREN to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin in your steppin faggot nigga
cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin
REAL NIGGAZ in the midst of droppin this bomb
Allah blessin me to rep for the better, and carry on
somethin great and keep a nigga name livin forever!

(Right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
[Verse 1]
Made me a leader before I was ready to lead
Took away my hunger, but didn't give me greed
Made me successful, when I just wanted to be heard
Give me the light, cause all I need is the word
Give me a life, that I'm responsible for
I'll give him what's right, cause I'm responsible for him
And into the night, I'm gonna be there with him
Facing a fight, I be right there with him
Ready for Heaven, cause I done been through the Hell
And since I was seven, I've had a story to tell
See God is great, and that's why I'm still livin'
He gave to me, so I'ma keep on givin'
The bravery of a man's mind is slavery
Is makin me the man I was made to be
I hate to see when cats know but don't spit it
Right is wrong, when it's on you gon get it
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I wake up frustrated dog, I'm hurtin' inside
Think about the brothers that put in, work and then died
A certain have tried, a certain have cried
When it didn't go right, you hit me like
You see things ain't always what they seem to be
And the reason I dream of thee is He's with me
And the reason I get through things so easily
Is by the grace of God cause he, see's the need to guide me
Walk right beside me
Because he knows what's goin on inside me, he tried me
Knew where my heart was at
Knew what I was thinkin
Knew when I was down and out, left there mistaken
Knew when to pick me up, cause it got too hard
Knew when I was gonna scream out ""Please God!""
And you already knew that you would be there for me
That's why I bring you together to give you the glory
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Everyday of life is a new chapter
And it's already been foretold, so it's up to the soul to capture
The essence of it all, the meak shall inherit the earth
Destined to ride with the call from birth
The true worth of a man, is not measured by what he does for hiself but
What he does for someone else
And if you help another, without concern for (?)
What you give, you shall recieve to unfold
X-Caliber The Ultimate Challenger
And I, put that on my soul
And, put that on my life
And, everything I own
And, everything I know
And, everything I show is what I was meant to do
Everything I told you is what I've been through
And everwhere I been, I was for a reason
Walk through the desert, ended up freezin
Start there, end up where?
And now they know...whatever which way they go
[Chorus]
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go (right and wrong)
Whatever which way they go
They know they gonna owe
They soul to the road they choose
It don't matter if you win or loose
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues
You still gotta pay them dues

Motha fuckers wanna kill me but don't got the heart
To look me in the eyes with the nine and spark
Cause whether your for or against this
When I spit with murderous intentions, everybody goes everybody knows
The weapons I possess they not for show
And you put dresses on your weapons when you walk out the door
See once I flash mother fuckers better do the one shot dash
Or be one shot ass
J to the A-Y to the drive by to your hood screamin bye-bye to you
Why would you fuck with me
Knowing I put you six feet deep and them niggas could die wit'cha
Cock the hot pistol and pop the hot Cristal
And promise you only one thing, to not miss you

Flows and mics, hell and night, go together like heaven and light
Niggas ain't seein my plight, It's alright
I let the world know I shine like ice

Cause I'm a gambling man, you should gamble with a gat in your hand
Spin in barrel and put it to your head

Dedicated to giving you nothing but thug shit
Think we playing, you undoubtable fall further

Put Ma Head Against Da Wall
Learnin Right From Wrong
They Say My Ghetto Instrumental Detrimentalin Kids
As If They Cant See The Misery In Which They Live
Blame Me
For The Outcome
Ban My Records (check it)
Dont Hafto Pump This But Please Respect It
I Took A Minus
And Now All The Hard Times Behind Us
Turned Into A Plus
Now They Stuck Livin' Blinded
Henessey Got Me Feelin' Bad
Time To Stop Drinkin' , Rollin' , And Drop Top Jag
Wish That Cops Thinkin'
Sittin' In My Car Watch The Stars In Smoke
I Came A Long Way
But Still I Got So Far To Go
..Dear Mama
Don Worry Ima Watch For Snakes
Tell .... That I Love Her
But Its Hard 2Day
I Got The Letter That She Sent Me
And I Cried For Weeks
This What Came Out When I Tried To Speak
All I Heard Was...
(Chorus)
Time Goes By
Puffin' On Life
Hopin' That It Gets me High
Got A Nigga Goin' Craazy
I Feel Craazy
Time Goes By Puffin' On Life
Hopin' That It Gets Me High
Got A Nigga Goin' Craazy
I Feel Craazy
(Verse Two)
(1, 2, 3, 4)
I See Bloods And Crips
Runnin' Up
Thinkin' Hell
Lookin' For A Better Waaay
Ma Brothers And Sisters
Its Time To Bail
Coz Even Thug Niggas Praay
Hopin' God (Hear Me)
Im Into The Game
Look How Much I Changed
Im No Longer Innocent
Casualties of Fame
Made Alot Of Money
Seen Alot Of Places
And I Swear I Seen A Peaceful Smile On My Mommas Face
When I Gave Her The Keys To Her Own House.. This your Landd
Your Only Son Done Became A Man
Watchin Time Fly
I Let My People Do Or Die
But I Wonder Why
We Scared To Let Eachother Fly
Dreams 1, 6, 7, 1
The Day
Ma Momma Pushed Me Out Her Room
Told Me Nigga Get Payed
No One Can Understand Me
The Black Sheep
Outcasted From Ma Family
Now Packin' Heat
I Run The Streets
A Young Runaway
Live For The Day
When He Die
I Can Hear Him Say....(C'mon)
(Chorus)
Time Goes By
Puffin' On Life
Hopin' That It Gets me High
Got A Nigga Goin' Craazy
I Feel Craazy
Time Goes By Puffin' On Life
Hopin' That It Gets Me High
Got A Nigga Goin' Craazy (Crazy!)
I Feel Craazy
(Verse 3)
God Help Me Out Here( Help me God)
Coz Im Possesed
I Need Your Root Of All Evil For My Stress
This Moneys Like A Strong Perscription Drug
Its Got Me Addicted To The
Pleasure And The Pain It Inflictied
Somethin Bout the Vapor Wit Da Bitches And The Presidents Head Damn
Its Like A Mutha Fuckin Plauge Has Spread
Its Epidemic, Forgotten, Forgotten It Got Worse
Keep My Head On Straight
Makin' Money Coz Its Cursed
Makin' Money Makes A Difference Day By Day
So You  Gotaa Stay
Hey No Doubt  They In And They Out
This Life Is Like A Visions Cycle
Caught Fightin To Live
No Matta How Hard You Try
You See Death
You Gotta By Alot of Mind
Tears Didnt Make It To Be Tears
Come Dear Life Doin Right Or Dear Life Doin Done
Who Has The Answers I Wonder?
I Turn To My Elders
They Aged And Expereinced
But They Cant Even Tell Ya
Or Tell Me That There'll Be Light At The End Of The Road (why?)
Coz They Don Even Know
A Million Things Run Through My Mind
Gotta Be In Jail Doing Time...
(Chorus)
Time Goes By
Puffin' On Life
Hopin' That It Gets me High
Got A Nigga Goin' Craazy (Crazy Crazy)
I Feel Craazy
Time Goes By Puffin' On Life
Hopin' That It Gets Me High
Got A Nigga Goin' Craazy(I Feel Fucked Up)

Only God can judge me, is that right
[synth voice] Only God can judge me now
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
Verse One: 2Pac
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
Chorus: 2Pac
[synth voice] Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
[synth voice] Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
[synth + Pac] Only God can judge me, only God can judge
[synth cont.] me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth + Pac] Only God can judge me
And only God can
[synth voice] Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth + Pac] Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
[synth voice] Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth voice] Only God can judge me now
*heart monitor: long beep*
Flatline!
Verse Two: 2Pac
I hear the doctor standing over me *heart monitor: beeping slowly*
screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me *beeping sound stops*
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that it's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me
Chorus w/ variations
Interlude: 2Pac
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real)
and I don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know)
Let me live baby, let me live
Verse Three: Rappin 4-Tay, Tupac
Pac I feel ya, keep servin it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz,  You can fade him,  punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
Chorus w/ variations
[4Tay] Only God main
[2Pac] That right
[4Tay] That's real
[2Pac] Hahahahahaha
[4Tay] Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin
[2Pac] Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out

Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
[Verse One:]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live
This life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes
Before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it
A player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try
Maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare
Shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it
The fighting and the hurting
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditionl love
[Chorus: 2x]
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
[Verse Two:]
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation
If could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three:]
I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency
I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
Cause everythang gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thang baby
Girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love
I always wonder,where would I be wiTh out u next to me
crazy and rough as Iam u will always see what I need.

Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor & even worse I'm black
my stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers
give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed, and that's the way it is
[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
aww yeah
[Repeat]
[2]
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
and only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way
sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""
Well hey, well that's the way it is
[Bridge]
[Talking:]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
what we gotta do, to survive.
[3]
And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the blacks givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
crack you up and pimp slap you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
& I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
some buck that I roughed up way back
comin' back after all these years
rat-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I Try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thugging
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on telling me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearing peeps

The game is getting deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminising
And having flashbacks when them niggas came up missing
(Wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Running silly through the court) They don't really wanna start
(How you wanna do?) Yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime)
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting
(Cause it ain't nothing, Y'all niggas is fronting
Do you really want it? niggas dying...)

Now, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'
Cup? in a flash sittin on that ass (And rarely fold)
Galitter tell 'em bout that trife shit (You wanna fight?
I wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch) bee-yatch!
A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
hustle (And doubled every fucking yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I coulnd't see it
Facing a century in the penatentury but so be it)
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
(Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait) No time for stalling (But death is calling)
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start falling
(True, what I do from sun up) is for a come up
(Wake up with my gun up) Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
(So It's time to spray like Ray
And put the freeze on these fake Gs) You know how we do

When your hero falls from grace
all fairy tales are uncovered
myths exposed and pain magnified
the greatest pain discovered
You tought me to be strong
but I'm confused to see you so weak
You said never to give up
and it hurts to see you welcome defeat
When your hero falls so do the stars
and so does the perception of tomarrow
without my hero there is only
me alone to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work
and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do
when your only hero falls

That's where motherfuckers is endin up
Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Niggaz gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty-niners
[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggaz countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row
[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me? 16 on Death Row
Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin
on the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair
[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...

Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin' back to brighten up the sky, how many die?
Heard the Fugees was tryin' to do me - look bitch!
I cut your face, this ain't no motherfuckin' movie
THEN! We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin' at my motherfuckin' sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin' trick shot
My lyrics runnin' all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we ride - on our enemies
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta diss toward a niggas grill some
Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said fuck Tech N9ne
Shady Pacino turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two thou we switched the game and spit the flame (Wah)
""Allah hu akbar"" - is what I say before I buck you
Motherfuck busters like vell Bacardi yeah nigga had enough you
Get ready to suffer - kneel down
Nigga, Tech N9ne Killer Klown
Nigga, six feet underground is where your found
Nigga, 40 water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like destiny's children - bitch
[Hook: C-Bo] (2X)
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain
Nigga, time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes - when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigger nigga
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin' to Biggie
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody heard
Know I meant, every motherfuckin' word
When we ride on our enemies
[Verse 4: C-Bo]
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' regime
Deep navis with heat like the A team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas makin' hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected from Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Whose got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched
Only left a ball I know you heard of me wanna murder me
Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now West Coast Mafia regime and thug zellin' Nigga

They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I got to throw away

Good Evening (sirens in the background)
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles
(crowd starts chanting ""Tupac"")
Awaiting the much anticipated release,
of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac
Which, raises the question
Where are these songs coming from?
It's interesting how, the message in these songs
Is still relevant today
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight
When the album will officially be released
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now

(Yeah hehehahaha, we goin platinum nigga! Plaahahatinum.)
Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We got my nigga Treach from Naughty by Nature in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker
[Verse One: Tupac]
My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin quick and then I vic just tryin to keep from gettin blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa! Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggaz bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin reckless
Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run
Some niggaz need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venomz
(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin em up with
that old deadly shit. Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.)
[Verse Two: Treach]
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
to the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin shit
pickin pockets with a razor stoppin Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, cause if you ain't a perfect ten
my sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin styles in em
Like women I did em I'm in for deadly ready venom
[Verse Three: Live Squad]
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin em down, I make em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
rob and steal and runnin from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin trails of brains and bladders
Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
something I don't wanna do, somethin that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom
(Yeah Mad, fuck that! You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)
[Verse Four: Live Squad]
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line em up single file, dome runnin in em
A nigga hit em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
(Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin over, yo 'Pac.)
[Verse Five: 2Pac]
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz
(Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here.
Apache bout to clean shit up.)
[Verse Six: Apache]
Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin up pooh-butts, cut em like cold cuts
Choke em with my boot lace, then leave em hangin like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim
(Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three

Please tell me what's a nigga to do and it's true
Ain't nuttin' new so I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK47 layin on my hips so don't trip
One motherfucker from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggaz if they fuck around
Yo, why ya'll got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch them motherfuckers gotta beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too

Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at eachother (fuck no), that's a motherfuckin' brother
So save two, run for cover
And other bitches from the clan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and

Pardon me, ??? has been God and try me
I'll be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin' to hell
I got the whole place covered with loc'ed out brothers
And nothing but love for eachother
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop
See it's cool to shoot a nigga but they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and oooohhhh you can't fuck with the crew

Postal border was makin' me mad
So I get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
Another lightweight sucker that can handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's just a day in the life
(2Pac)
Finally I'm on vacation and school is through
So here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to do
Tried to get outta my bed, but I can't move
Ya see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
But I was all alone so it wasn't no thing
Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it
I'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said: ""Sorry that I kept you""
I started rappin', girls started clappin'
Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'
Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come on
A day in the life
(Ray Tyson)
Stretch white limo hits the colessium
A crowd full of people sayin: ""I can't wait to see him""
Who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
Strictly Dope in the house, hear to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere I look are screamin'

Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see it so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see what comes to be
When your hero falls soley the stars, and so does the reception of tomorrow
Without my hero, there's only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls
As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together

I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Twenty-one gun salute, dressed in fatigue, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talkin bout he left the hospital took five like me
You living fantasies, nigga I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now we out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein a thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryin to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Lovin how I got you niggas crazy
Against all odds
Hopin my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds
Hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
I heard he was light skinned, stocky with a Haitian accent
Jewelery, fast cars and he's known for flashing (What's his name???)
Listen while I take you back (NIGGA SAY HIS NAME!) and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin for the feds, same crime, different trials
Nigga, picture what he said, and did I mention
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin, The World Is Mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I own
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, ""WHY YOU LIE?!?""
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots too tight, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga this M-O-B
So believe me we enemies, I go against all odds
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds
Puffy gettin robbed like a bitch, to hide the fact
he did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ride em for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin dead
Switch sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin the dead
Lord listen to me
God don't like ugly, It Was Written
Hey nas
, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life, so what's the answer Nas?
Niggas that don't rhyme right, you've seen too many movies
Load em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die, GOODBYE
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me nigga
Against all odds
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
[repeat]
Against all odds
[Twenty-one gun salute]
One love to my true thug niggas (Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
Twenty-one gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin to the fullest bein soldiers with military minds
that play the rules of the game, twenty-one gun salute
I salute you my niggas, stay strong
I ride for you, I rhyme for you, I roll for you, it's all for you
To all you bitch made niggas, I'm comin for you
Against all odds, I don't care who the fuck you is, nigga
You touch me I'm at you
I know you motherfuckers think that I forgot
Hell no I ain't forgot nigga
I just remember what you told me
You said don't go to war unless I got my money behind me
Aight, I got my money right here, now I want war

[B-Legit] Influenced by crime addicted to grinding
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me one timer
[Tupac] Been Ballin' since my adolecsent years steady climbing
[E-40] Man, you mutha-fuckas don't know nothing about no timing
[Tupac Talking] Thats right boy start that shit off
[Tupac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Picutes of me in my final stage, You know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I know longer existed, mysteriously missing
I'm know world wide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for theives and I'm cautious, its like I'm barely breathing
Putting a bullet in mutha-fuckas give me a reason
See me and hope i'm and intoxicated looks like we faded
You tried to play me, now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards keep running, So scared to fire G
For the life of me, I can't see
How mutha-fuckas picture living life after a night
of fucking around with me
And if yah don't like this rhyme then bring you big bad ass
to California
Cuz we ain't hard to find
[B-Legit] Influenced by crime addicted to grinding
[C-Bo] Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich] And niggas call me one timer
[Tupac] Been Ballin' since my adolecsent years steady climbing
[E-40] Man, you mutha-fuckas don't know nothing about no timing
[C-Bo]
I got my locs on hard hat going to war
Breaking them off on sight stopping lives on red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull out my strap out my drawers
And get the dumping on their ass like the last outlaws
Rich and Tupac and the Cliq smoking blunts and loading clips
With enough shit to raise your whole block in one dip
We bring on horror like tales from the crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
[B-Legit]
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Moving dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm riding shot gun put the [tint in the back]
I'm planning on having a mutha-fuckin' mit in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O where selling narcotics is all I know
I got slow speed blue whatever your kind
And if yah need a mutha-fucka I ain't hard to find
[C-Bo]
Some of 'em may call it low speed but I call it timin'
That's why I keeps on grinding
To a point where a nigga can't stop
To much feelings and shit thats why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether its a nigga or a hoe a hoe
Get in my way then that ass gots to go
Cuz a nigga steady plotting I serve hit for hit
And mutha-fuckas keep dropping

[E-40]
Down the steps down the broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga what the fuck you got a gun if yah gonna hesitate
Best ta shake and bake although my was first to ask niggas
Mutha-fuckas thought I wasn't going do something ask niggas
Threatin' your life it ain't like you love 'em
Bury your thoughts take his head fuckin' half ready
[Richie Rich]
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he trying to ride the legend for the other side
But now my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental nigga
If your gum bleed and you bleeding more than 20 sticthes
You behave like them bitches
Side ways to the next heavy in the game
Check the resident It's all the same
Nigga and we ain't hard to find
... why them niggas acting like they can't find like like they can't see us
and like we don't be at the same spots that they be at...

You probably crooked as the last trick
Women laugh at How I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinking I had her but she had me in the long run
it's just my luck i'm stuck here fuckin with the wrong one
unwise decisions based on lies we living
Skandalous times games like my religion
You could be rolling with a thug
Instead you with this sweet schrub
Looking for some love in every club
I see you starring like you want it
Well baby if yah got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' into walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to hollar but you say you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess its true what they telling me
Fresh out of jail life's hell for a black celebrity
So thats the reason why I call
And maybe you with it
Fantansies of something can I hit it (Ha Ha)
Addicted to the things you do
Its still true what I'm saying Boo
cuz this is All About U
Chorus--Nate Dogg(2X)
Every other city we go
Every other video
[its all about u]
No matter where I go
I see the same hoe
(2pac)
I'll make a promise if yah go with me
Have you hollar running out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hang out with the criminals and the drug dealers
I love niggas
Be coming from the same place
Witness me hollar at a hoochie, see how long the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa
And I don't even care
Creep slow breath smokes into the air
Everywhere I go, its all about the crooked hoes
waiting for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen yah in my friend's video
I never put a bitch before my friends, the way to go
Follow the leader and peep the drama I'm going through
It's all about U

Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew

But you know what

I bet you got it twisted

So many playa hating niggas trying to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they know it
Straight to the depths of hell is were those cowards goin'
Well are you still down nigga, Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry, but they finally freed me
I got a cariban of niggas, every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hitting mutha-fuckas up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die Live the life of a Boss playa, cuz even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyez
Cuz all I want is cash and thangs,
a five double 0 Benz and flaunting flashy rings Uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream,
been know to disappear before your eyez, just like a dope fiend, it seems
My main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a mutha-fuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One niggas getting jealous, and muthafuckas died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They my homies for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas, and low riders, and ski masks
screaming Thug Life every time they pass

So much trouble in the world, nigga
can't nobody feel your pain
The world changing everyday
times moving faaast
My girl said I need to raise up, how long will she last
I'm caught between my women, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as we dip
I'm lost in the land, with no plan, living life flawless
Crime Boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm taking off on the curb
The nervousless neglect make me pack a tek
Devoted to serving this, Moet and paaayyy checks
Like a kite sailin' nigga I'm forever Ballin'
And they like parasites, triggas and fleas crawlin'
Sucka duck and gat bustin, no emotion
nine and four shit is handling my business nigga keep on coastin'
where yah goin' I been there came back as lonely homie
steady flaunting against the grain nigga still don't know me
It's about the money, and the rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggas don't even know how to act shit
what can I do, what can I say, is there another way
Blunts and Gin twenty-four parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
niggas can't stand me

(Tupac)
The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
will I survive, will I die, come on lets picture the possibilities
Giving me charges, lawyers making a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and thats why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, alone, as a teenager, on the mobile
calling big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers, Fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, balllin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the morning, never stopped until the cash came
I live my life as a Thug nigga
untill the day I die
Live my life as a Boss playa
cuz we be getting high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down now its time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these muthafuckas suffer
Up in the Benz burning rubber

Cuz the criminal lifestyle equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the Meal ticket
Get your money muthafucka Lets get rich and we'll kick it
All eyez on Me
Chorus -- Tupac

As the world turns..
As the world turns my niggaz grow and grow and grow
and get dough and roll and ride
Niggaz die and mommas cry
Niggaz got alibis and suicides and homicides
and three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggaz fame, as the world turns..
Though I walk thru the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
and still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
if we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
like last year, niggaz stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob, M-O-B
Killin bustaz is my motherfuckin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggaz reported missin
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns...
Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)
(Turns.. turns, turns, turns, and turns
My niggaz grow and grow and grow
and gettin dough and dough and dough
from this state to that state
from this cell to that cell, as the world turns)
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
[Young Noble]
As the world turn burnin paths, starin through my rearview
It's a war goin on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin, ""Watch em they'll kill you""
Sippin Thug Passion, scrub actin like he feel you
Steady plottin, ready or not; Outlawz lost
but not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlawww
[Napoleon]
Another lonely nigga with a 12-gage pump
with a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, fuck these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug nigga
Kadafi betta unslug this nigga, Seike betta undrug this nigga
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch em wet with the tec
Hit em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
Nigga talkin thug walkin all through yo' squad
Y'all niggaz scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns..
Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)
(And my niggaz roll and ride, hahaha
Niggaz gettin swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit! As the world turns..
Niggaz die for
How many you niggaz try for this? As the world turns
Murderin methods.. haha OUTLAW!)
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns..
[E.D.I. Amin]
Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn
[Kadafi]
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin
Only five years up in this bitch, poppa runnin from the Feds
Puttin peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
to protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
for this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper (repeats as Tupac speaks)
[2Pac]
Hahaha.. as the world turns..
and turns and turns and turns.. haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns
Money come and go, hoes come and go, foes come and go
Friends come and go.. my soldiers, stay eternal
Outlaw Immortalz, dedicated
I send this to black Jesus, only he can feed us
When you need us, as the world turns
Throw this shit in the deck, hahah
Niggaz gettin chin checked
From the East to the West best to wear a vest
Nigga we ain't the ones to test, fuck you
As the world turns
Outlaw ridahs, Mutah right beside us
Camillion, wanna make a million
Haha legit, as the world turns.. haha..
Burn baby burn
[Napoleon]
A lot of niggaz get burned as the world turns
A lot of niggaz gettin burned as the world turns..
Gettin burned as the world turns

I feel you {uhh} .. (baby don't)
but you can't, you can't give up
{Hey.. 2Pac what?}
[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {Outlawz}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up

[2Pac]
Now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me,
""What would you do if it was you?""
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed niggaz grabbin me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four niggaz violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
cause they win when your soul dies
[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {never give up}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry

Uhh
Forget him girl (forget him girl) he ain't gon' never change

Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin mo')
and never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'
Uh oh (uh oh), now you bout to have his baby? (dayamn)
Another wild-ass nigga that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin to do - I'm spittin this to you,
cause you deserve more than what he givin to you (that's right)
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
got em all stuck standin still when she come through
Baby take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
gon' give you everything you need, feel me?

Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that nigga do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-class
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
But those, ain't my seeds, nuttin really I could do (nah)

How we twist shit, what change but the name?
We still here, you rockin wit the best
Don't worry if I write rhymes, I write checks (ahh!)

This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..
[2Pac]
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob niggaz love to act up
The first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennesey
Talkin to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin ""Fuck the police,"" as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
[Chorus: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)
[2Pac]
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - than hear the ballad of a dead soldier
[Chorus]
[last line:] ""close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier""
[2Pac]
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the niggaz came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin niggaz in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier
[Chorus]
[last line:] ""close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier""

This go out to Cato, Mental
All the niggaz that passed away
To Geronimo.. (?).. all the down ass riders
All the niggaz that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggaz that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggaz'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin block, fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets nigga
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These niggaz can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier!

Better days, heyyy! Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
Better days! Better days, better days
Heyyy! Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
[Verse One]
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days
Better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy! Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
[Verse Two]
Thinkin back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
that in my future years, I'd be stressin
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin llello all day long, but they wrong
So I'm solo and so broke
Savin up for some Jordan's, cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I
I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
Lookin for them better days
For better days, better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy! Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
[Verse Three]
Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin like grown men when rollin
I went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin marks
Got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin you well, I know it's hell
Doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doin cool
I settled down, had a family, workin in night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days
Better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. I'm thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy! Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
I send this one out, to all the homeboys down in uh, Clinton lockdown
Rikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin homeboy, keep your head up
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy! Better days.. uhh, lookin for the better days
Better days, better days, lookin for the better days
Heyyy! Hahaha..

Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)
[Chorus: Eminem]
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/--?)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care
[Kastro: Verse 3]
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what i know
I dont trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
[Young Noble: Verse 4]
Black cotton, I'm plottin' --
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
??
certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves
If you aint got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton
[Chorus]

Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton- A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
Verse One: 2Pac
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)
Chorus: Eminem
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/--?)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care
Kastro: Verse 3
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what i know
I dont trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet

Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
(Black Jesus; you can be Christian
Baptist, Jehovah Witness)
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
(Islamic, won't matter to me
I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off nigga..
What?
[Kadafi]
I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin to be trapped
on no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin us back
Or just another one of my Black JesuS traps
[Storm]
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Cause I swear, they tryin to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist?  Black Jesus
[2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahahaha
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
[Young Noble]
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus
[2Pac]
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggaz pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggaz play together
We die clutchin glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Creamated, last wishes nigga smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin the people livin in them
I was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin Black Jesus

All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail

In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through

[Kastro]
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin... Jesus
{*singers repeat in background 3X*}
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all

[music from To Live   Die in L.A. fades]
[This Week in Bible Prophecy]
God has a plan -- and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our saviour
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
to unfold the wonderful plan of eternity, for my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and saviour
And as the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy
[Tupac]
Tupac don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed -- and I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me -- remember what my pops told me
My family tree, consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin, known to hustle screamin fuck they feelings
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Niggaz, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggaz gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one -- get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one, watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
or come to grips with bein on my enemy's wall (rest in peace)
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonite
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nuttin free, give back what you earn, no doubt
Gettin higher than a motherfucker, blessed and pleased
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
[Chorus: Prince Ital]
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud
Usin de name of de Lord in vein
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
[Tupac]
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin devil niggaz daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severly
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
doin wild shit, lookin at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly -- Babylon beware
Comin from the Pharoahe's kids, retaliation
Makin legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin
Niggaz in Jerusalem, waitin for signs
God promised, she's just takin her time, haha
Living by the Nile while the water flows
I'm contemplating plots wondering which door to go
Brothas getting shot, comin back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga check it (that raw shit)
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
[Chorus]
[Tupac]
The preacher want me buried why? Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds, thinkin that they evil
while the preacher bein richer you say honor God's people
Should we cry, when the Pope die, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
waitin to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin up cash
to the leaders, knowin damn well, it ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, time in D.C.
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
times in this crime man, my Thug nation
Do whatchu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door? And my people say
[Chorus 4X]
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallow be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
In earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us, unevil
For God, is the kingdom, and the power
and the glory forever, and ever, and ever

Tupac Shakur just released another album
under the alias Makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild
trying to rearrange other artistry dates
in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album,
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate
the character of not only Mr. Shakur
but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas the alleged ringleader of is furious
of Tupac's excuse me, Makaveli's verbal assault
on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers.
Jay Z of Hawaiian soapy fame,
Big Little whatever and several other corny sounding motherfuckas
are understandably shakin up by this release.
The question everybody wants to know is
""Why'd they get this nigga started?""
Tupac rather, Makaveli was not available
for comment but released this statement:
[Makaveli]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money, riders and punks.
Which side are you on?
*gun cocked, six shots, shells hit ground*
These niggaz is still fuckin talkin?
You nigga still breathin? Fuckin roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for you cockaroches
All day
You punk mutha-fuckas
The shit nigga
Killuminati Style
Makaveli the Don
Solo shit
Bring It
Allow me to introduce first
Makaveli the Don
Sprits, Spurting, Spiritual, Lyrics
Like the Holy Koran
Niggas get Shook Like 5-0
My 4-5 gun is next to me when we ride
Plus Survival
Money Making plans
Pistol Closing hands
Swollen Pockets
Let me introduce the topic
Then we drop it
Expose Snakes cuz they breath freely
See me ride
Located world wide
Like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tuffer than any
My attitude is shitty
Born in the dope fiends titty
And every city you'll find me
Looking for trouble
Right behind me
My outlaw Niggas
Down to die for me
(Naw what I mean)
I hit the scene
Niggas ducking for my Guillotine Stare
I'm right there
My every word
A fucking night mare
Getting high
Let me see the sun rise and fall
This is for my dogs
Down to die for yours
Extreme Venom
No mercy
When we all up in 'em
Cut em Down
To hell is where we send them
My whole team
Trying to explode
Rather die
Murder mutha-fuckas lyrically
And I'm not gonna cry
Me
A born leader
Never leave the block
without my heater
Two big pitts
I call them Mobb Bitch
Nigga eaters
And I won't whimper till I'm gone
Thug Life
Running through my veins
So I'm strong
Ha ha ha
Bye Bye bye
Lets get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas
But I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa
Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep
Nigga when I find you
Weak mutha-fuckas don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me
Yeah Yeah
West Coast Ridaz
Comin right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit me
I want money hoes sex and weed
I wont rest till my Row Doggs free

We Bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We didn't even come to (hurt nobody)X1) fightX2 tonight
But it's my life or your life
And I'm a bomb first
E.D.I. (Idi Amin)
For so many days and some many ways
We've been duckin strays
Hate to live us
But we still some Badboy Killas
Got nothin to lose, got no where to go
I only got one home see me stranded on Deathrow
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
and I be a soldier on a mission, suptitude
but you'll never do
That's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I leave this bitch I'm dyin with choice
Kamikaze sicker than a mothafuckin Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made Poparazi
Tell me if you ain't in this rap game
For the mothafuckin cash man
Then what is ya mothafuckin purpose
None for service
Idi Amin born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first bitch
Young Noble
Yer style wack as ever
Like you was rocket patent leather
Cause a massive terror
Ya'll niggas lack, you ain't terrel
Half rapper half drug kingpen
Yer tellin fairy tales son
Kickin New York like you the mothafuckin one
But I'm from Jers we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to North Bricks
All my niggas flippin chips
Gettin rich
Even though it's hard
Tryin to creep through these halls abroad without scar by ????
With no warning signs cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine

Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
exorcisin all demons
Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
to bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me
Make the frontpage primetime live on TV

I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine

All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature
to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drop of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes -- now it's time for war
Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang wit the fellas, I wait patiently alone
anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend

When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
the only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home, me and my girlfriend

Brenda's got a Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby
Well, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
Tha girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not her problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a
junky
Went in debt to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger
But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, whos sexed and crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together,
whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
what ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here
everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby
Baaaaaaaaby
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)

Thinkin' back
reminiscing on my teens
a young G
getten' paid over dope fiends
fuckin' off cash that I make
nigga, what's tha sense of workin hard
if you never get tp play
i'm hustlen'
stayin' out till it's dawn
and commin' home
at 6 o'clock in tha mornin'
hand's on my glock
eye's on tha prize
finger on tha trigga when a nigga rides
shootin' craps
bustin' niggas out tha door
pick my money off tha floor
god bless tha tre-four
stuck on full, drunk again
sippin' on Gin
with a couple of friends
sayin' those thug life niggas be like major pimps
stickin' to tha rules is what made it simp
and if I die
let it be
but when they come for me
bury me a G
[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]
I ain't got time for bitches
Gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
bury me a G
More Trouble than tha average
just made 25 and i'm livin' like a savage
bein a G ain't no easy thing
cause you could fuck around get crossed
and get stuck in tha game
and for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise
wonder why it had to end like this
and to tha G's you can feel my pain
till tha mothafuckas gets born again
you thought I was a game kid
i'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
when I pull tha trigga on my gauge
i'm on tha rampage
makin' runs for tha devil
ain't nothin' on my mind
will get me in some trouble
i'm tryin to ride
no more loves
for me hard to figure
get a nigga, smoke a blunt
Or is a jury starts (break that shit)
I gives a fuck nigga
stuck outta luck
when I bust
pull me to my death
but i'm a G to tha enemy
[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]
I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
bury me a G
[Stretch]
I got nothen' ta loose so I choose to be a killer
went from bangin' ta slangin'
now i'm a dope dealer
all my life payed tha price to be tha boss
back in school
wrote tha rules on getten' tossed
poppin' rocks on tha block was a past time
pack a 9 all the time
you wanna test mine ?
don't cry
I die before they play me
from tha cradle to tha grave
bury me
Straight Thug G
kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
getten' drunk, smokin' blunts
a bitch said I was no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in tha dope spot
never had no time for no bitch
instead slangin' rocks
and bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs
fake ass G's
bitch niggas with no heart
i'm stayin' real till i'm 6 feet deep
so when a nigga gone
bury me a G
[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]
I ain't got time for bitches
gotta keep my mind on my mothafucken riches
even when I die
they won't worry me
mama don't cry
Bury Me a G

Stuck on Full
Tangaray got a nigga high
lord knows I don't need another DUI
I led a Thug Life
heartless hustler
just cause I fucked
don't mean I trust her
now my pagers vibratin'
can't sleep
so i'm mobbin' to tha ho's house
pumpin' Isely
Is it cool ta fuck is what i'm askin
Bitch recognize game and start laughen
when i'm all in those guts and shit
prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
cause i'll fuck and get up and let ya know
i'll be a 10 minute brotha for a $2 ho

And pimps be on a mission for them greens

One love, one life

Can you see.. the pride of the panther
As she nurtures.. her young all alone
It's the seed.. that must grow regardless
of the fact that, it's been planted in stone
Can you see.. the pride of the panther
In the concrete jungle, alone with her cub
It's the seed.. that must come to harvest
It's the tree.. that must grow out of love
Can you see the pride in the panther
as he glows in splendor and grace?
Topling obstacles placed
in the way of the progression of his race?
Can you see the pride in the panther
as she nurtures her young, all alone?
The seed must grow regardless
of the fact that it's planted in stone
Can't you see the pride of the panthers

Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up.
[girl]
You know I got a man.
[2Pac]
I know you got a man
but he ain't gon' if I take you out.
[girl]
Of course he gon' mind.
[2Pac]
Let me take you to lunch.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
before anybody see.
[girl]
I can't. (Aww c'mon!) He ain't gon' let me.
[2Pac]
Pleeeeeease...
[girl]
Nah.
[2Pac]
Oh aight. What's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin
got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon.. let's go.. can you get away?
Can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know, I know
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Just for a little while love
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
I know it's hard but, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Let's go man, get up outta there
.. can you get away?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Do you love him?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Do you love that man?
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know it is
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Yeah you can
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
You ain't happy huh ..can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know.. is he beatin on you?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Did he punch you?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Throwin you around the house?
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Can't get away.. why?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Let me take you away
All I really know, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Man..
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Course you can get away
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
If you really wanted to get away
you could get away
[Outro: 2Pac]
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
with this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't tryin to put you in a position
where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
you need but now.. he ain't even takin care of you
He beatin on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI'msayin? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to, yaknowhatI'msayin?
The emergency room, gettin stitches
cause this nigga done got jealous
Don't cry, it's all good
[girl]
Can you take me from here?
[2Pac]
Shake that man, get away
[girl]
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here
And I need you to show me love
Because it's so much pressure now
And I neeeeed to get awayyyheyyyeahhh

U might think it's unbelivable But word to the strenght
when it comes to rockin? rhymes I'm a musical nymph
They gave me other mics But yo it wasn't no use
I tried to rock One two one two
But I couldn't get loose I said forget it
My microphone or not I gotta do it
Give it all that I go (What if u loose) It be the first time I lost
But if I beat ?em I'll finally prove I'm the boss
I grabbed my leather jacket Walked through the streets
Suckers was hopin? and preyin Strictly Dope would get beat
I begin to get hyped I was ready to fight
Yo I was confident that I'd win
To hell with the mic
I hopped up to the stage Dizzy started the beat
suckers shivered cause he Tasted defeat
Then I signaled to Dizzy Bust a rhyme off my head
Perpetrator fell back (Huh) And then he was dead
I was happy as hell Cause I was lucky that nite
Put my hand in my pocket And there was my mic
THE CASE OF THE MISPLACED MIC
STRICTLY DOPE IN THE HOUSE

[Verse 1: Tupac]
Cross this nigga here
Now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a living soul breathing shall pump no fear here
My last four flashed then I mashed his ass
Bastard
Fuck with me bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me
Caught in a maze
Catch em
Mimicking my style trying to walk this way
Impossible my posse dropping you
We Death Row riders
No need to beg motherfucker ain't no mercy inside us
Feeling blessed
The richer I get the more I stress
Smoking lye watching time fly, waiting for death
Dear God I been feeling like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smoking trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watching niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
Me
A mercenary for the streets
Check my pedigree
Busting motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit
Then get to squealing
Bitch made catching feeling
Hahaha
[Chorus X2]
Outlaw niggas are you ready to clown
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screaming bye bye bitches
Untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catching Feelings
[Verse 2: Napolean]
Yeah, Napolean..
Picture me sipping on 1-5-1
Drunk then a motherfucker
Dropping my gun
Or as high as a kite hitting hoes for fun
But that ain't me
Dog my minds now clear
And that ain't fair dog
Your heart pump fear
In the state I *censored*
You better hide nigga *censored* is near
And you know just as well I do
You ain't no killer
So kill that
You wouldn't kill if you had to
We might wobble but we don't fall down
We take the gospel from Makaveli
Pass it around
Ahhhh, shit
We gonna taste the power
We started the thug trend
The game is ours
Now we coast together
Put our thoughts together
Won't question will we die together
Cause the hour is soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier
I show you how to use your gun
Bring it
[Chorus x2]
Outlaw niggas are you ready to clown
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screaming bye bye bitches
Untouchable sound
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Catching Feelings
[Verse 3]
We Yelling

'Till the wheels fall off
Pay attention
Screaming
Bye bye bitches
Untouchable sound (ugh)
Ride or die niggas
And we hunting you down
Representing all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Banging out with the po po
Trying to get to some mo'
Street life
Young strugglers
Racing the clock
Ain't no telling when it all can end
Roll or rock
That's the world
With feelings
This a mans world youngin'
The bitches in business
So learn a 'lil something
Hey

Everybody's a gangsta
But don't put in work
Instead of putting on the armor
Niggas put on a skirt
These drugs ain't helping
It only making it worse
And the streets ain't got nothing for me but herbs
I can't trust the church or the mobs
I can only trust God
And to tell you the truth I gotta ride
I only roll with the real
Cause rolling with the fake got my loved ones killed
[Chorus x3]
Outlaw niggas are you ready to clown
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Screaming bye bye bitches
Untouchable sound

[2Pac & Govenor]
G: Why'd you slang crack
P: I had to
G: Why'd you pack the straps
P: Cause I had to)
G: Why'dd you jack the scratch
P: Cause I had to
G: Say what, say what
P: A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent
Pac
You certified crazy
[2Pac]
I got to work with what you gave me
Claiming' I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
now I'm lost in this Holocaust headed for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
and got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
and if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a nigga got to do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm gettin' tested
And if I don't say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are gettin' restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
And since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck, buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when I'm fool, bust
They make a nigga be a killer I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder If the Lord ever heard of me (uh)
I need loot so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues
[Chorus: 2Pac & Govenor]
Can't you see, we're raised to all be thugs
Make's us do the things we do
Got to let a Outlaw make moves
(A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent)
Why did you slang crack (Cause I had to)
Why did you pack straps (Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch (Cause I had to)
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent
[2Pac]
Poppa need brand new shoes
but what the fuck can a nigga do
My little boy got to eat too
So why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockafella?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to drink
Cops want to hit me with the book
And you're hooked on my eye don't give a fuck look
Make your rules I'm a break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em
You show me bacon I'm a take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty
to my brothers In the barrio
You livin' worse than the niggas In the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
Got love, you got problems with the punk police
Don't run from the chumps get the pump from me
We ain't free I'll be damned if I played a trick
For a blonde hair blue-eyed Caucasian bitch (Bitch!)
Down with my homeboy Rich
Fuck a snitch and a groupie ass bitch
And the nigga with a cellular phone
Leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone (That ain't right)
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas
Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas (What's up kid)
And they bound to be fuckups too
Drinkin' forties of brew singin' nigga blues
(Hey Pac, say what?)
[Chorus: 2Pac & Govenor]
Why did you slang crack (Cause I had to)
Why did you pack straps (Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch (Cause I had to)
Come on, Come on Now I'm headin' for the mothafuckin' penn
[2Xs]
[Outro: 2Pac & Govenor] 4x
Can't you see we're raised to all be thugs
Makes us do the things we do you got to let a Outlaw
Make moves and get a grip
That's to you

[2Pac]
Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look
[Verse One: 2Pac]
By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin homey, when we ridin?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin is
[Chorus: Johnta' Austin + (2Pac)]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin with a changed man)
All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man
[Verse Two: T.I.]
In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
to be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet? (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man
[Chorus]
[Chorus w/ 2Pac speaking over it]
[2Pac]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man

You fuckin with a changed man

Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor & even worse I'm black
my stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope & let 'em deal the brothers
give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed, and that's the way it is
[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
aww yeah
[Repeat]
[2]
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
and only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today"" But you made it in a sleazy way
sellin' crack to the kid. "" I gotta get paid,""
Well hey, well that's the way it is
[Bridge]
[Talking:]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
what we gotta do, to survive.
[3]
And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets & the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the blacks givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
crack you up and pimp slap you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
& I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
some buck that I roughed up way back
comin' back after all these years
rat-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh

You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
[2Pac - Verse 1]
(Come on come on )
I see no changes (Fabolous - You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes.)
Wake up in the morning and I ask myself (Fabolous - You know?)

This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you

If you got love for me, I still got love for you

If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you
[Fabolous - Verse 2]
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold
They say I'm different 'cuz I ride in a plat. Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole
And I aint givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?
[Fabolous - Chorus]
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you

Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few ?? and met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the bed ?? veterans
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed,

breathe stinkin' as I'm yawning
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers
While I'm into sexy capers
Give a hollar to them hoochies last night who tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us
Plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a Boss Playa
death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy
Alazhay and Heneesee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested
picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny
All up on me
hot and horny
what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, till you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited
It don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time

We got to go (2X)
Its check out time
We got to go (4X)
(Kurupt)
They label me an outlaw
So its time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true
with Janet on, I'm in an Escapade
Did it all, in too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume
Since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then its only right for me to disappear into the night
My games trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak into your room
instant Messiah
shit, wines of all kinds
I ain't got much time
so hurry up and pop the dime
And let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I gots to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention
I'm done and I'm out
cuz there's someone else who deserves my atttention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cuz busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time
(Chorus)
We got to go (8X)
(Syke)
Now I'm living the life of a Boss Playa
The front desk callin'
but I'm checking out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could

From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
June 16, 1971
Mama gave birth
to a hell raisin' heavanly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me
but I smacked him back,
My first words were ""thug for life""
and ""Papa pass the Mac.""
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked
bustin' at niggas
when will it stop ?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin'
will I escape in prison ?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance
and if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
Cause when we fight
it's in the middle of the night with no lights on.
Hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind
this motha fucka's tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house
all about mail and bank
Never die
be a hustler mothafuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas.
From the cradle to the grave.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. easy
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave
since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!
just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Survalience on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young niggas bein' raised by the streets.
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
a striaght thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts
one black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got
so stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave
and keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard
and all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
as the warzone I got no home
don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my ho.
Never leave home with out my sugar.
I'm hafta plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money
and through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
March 18th
a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc
but my family's broke
And my pocket's short
so now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
Shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop
hear my glock cock
thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easyy
Living in the ghetto.
Time's movin' fast
will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone held me
but they never did.
I can't take it
will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me
crazy.
Do or die. Nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high
then my mission is a walk-by.
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' ""evil mind"" as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The begining is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.
[Chorus til fade]

I got a tech nine now his smokin ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, ""Freeze!""
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk.. please..
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to.. hush..
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me.. body..
One to the chest, another to his fuckin dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone

The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test

[Verse One: 2Pac]
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
with the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green   ""Sweet Franklin"" w/ 2Pac]
Lady...
Don't cha know we love ya? Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't cha know we love ya?
[second and third chorus, ""And dear mama"" instead of ""Dear mama""]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I may act craazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

[Mother:] I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
with that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
you don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the- corner, anyday
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin and strivin, my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
but I see death around the corner

I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner

I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner,
the pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin I die the way I lived,
straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
who was buggin'
My homie told me once,
don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
who done passed away screamin, please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
[Chorus]
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor til' you out cold
And tho' i'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin on them niggas til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin high was a way of gettin free
I see death around the corner
[Chorus]
This is for all the real mothafuckin niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know ?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
all right

I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground

Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
I shoulda seen
you was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
we had some problems but we workin at it, and now
the arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
that's right, sucka for love
[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won't do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don't give up
[repeat 2X]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
to makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
when we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
damn, sucka for love... sucka for love
sucka for love
[Chorus]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
but I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
sucka for love, know you ain't right G but yet I'ma sucka for love
[Chorus]
I'ma sucka for love, sucka for love
Sucka for love
[Chorus]

Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight lo
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted
[chorus]
Don't get it twisted!.....
[Macadoshis]
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When i smoke you with this mac-10
When it's on it's on
Fuck it
I'm makin niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when i said:
Don't get it twisted!
[chorus]
[Rated R]
Niggas got problems about gettin shit twisted
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started
Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer

Don't go 2 sleep,
You can get your cash on nigga if you peak,
Other niggaz close there eyes seeing DREAMS in they sleep
But don't fall 2 sleep
Quit staring at my like a infra-red nigga
(Verse 1: Makaveli)
Pictures of plenty
Sippin my glass full of henny
Hands on my semi -
- Automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact
Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggaz die with open eyes
Scared to take a nap
It's a trap
A long maze
Dreaming of getting stacks
Making scratch the wrong way
What song says
We murder mother fucker's daily
Black out
Blow the the track out
My lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed
Then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like Yay Yo
Niggaz pull out
When I say so
Commence to poppin'
Mother fuckers copy and fail
Efficiently I release and flee
The art of war living sucka free
Get with me

In a pistol populated area
In a distance and a width with a glock
And about ten of the homeboyz on smash
Get to smashin'

About fifteen others postin'

The gangsta's run this mother fucker
Constantly smokin' we murder everything in this bitch eyes wide open

Don't sleep nigga
Don't trip or tweak nigga

Animated of it all in juvenated my dawgs
Fuckin' up these niggas for the wrong or right cause
Breakin' laws

Just fuckin' all y'all
Seeing is believing now its time to break down the wall
Barricaded
Faded
Except for just one blast
Let em' know don't fuck around wit Kurupt, Pac and Daz
Created for gunshots to vacate the block
After its all done nigga
What do i got?
Hoo bangin on niggas for more than 15 figures
Put a hex on they ass
And watch they ass die quicker
Daz hit like a killa, make em all remember
The deadly wrath, I can make they family shiver
Control it and hold it down
Won't renounce the crown
Servin' and lay these mothafuckas down
Drop the bomb
Prepare for war

[Intro: Tupac talking]
This go out to C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole
And everybody else who feels like uh
They stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of speech
Ha ha ha
Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everyone, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop hater
here going against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban Tupac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em
[Verse One: Young Noble]
Listen it ain't no stopping
I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double, try to
Stop it and touch it, I'ma cock it and bust it
Niggaz tryna get it addicted to fast living
Get rich or die trying nigga as 50
I've been Operating Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government ?? by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screaming Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Giving my niggaz life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all going through the struggle
Penny pinching
It's like you really ain't living
? until eleven's, I'm cooking in the kitchen
Like we looking and we wishing
Praying will he hear it?
It's eating at my spirit
Speaking for the spirits
[Verse Two: Tupac]
You can't break me
Never make me
Busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Deloris Tucker sue me I won't stop
Till we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites
Whistling Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Didn't cry when they dropped me
(Nah)
Can they stop me?
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an Outlaw
Ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop
[Chorus: Young Noble & Stormy]
No way no how we got to keep moving
And putting it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggaz don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep going
[Verse Three: Hussein Fatal]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
I've God strike me with lightning, I'm shooting him back
Skinny cause I don't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm
Fuck the world till I'm gone
I'm bucking at Corey Brooke he treating my niggaz wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks ducking from the penitentiary
[Verse Four: Kadafi]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams its all wrong
Pop too long gone, and now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my thrown pal like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton
[Verse Five: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearing Red I'ma rock the Green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggaz hate it but they scared of the Fifth
(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!
[Chorus]
[Verse Six: Big Syke]
This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hiding me
My nigga, made a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stopping me
My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they ?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlawz, Makaveli niggaz ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggaz be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life
[Verse Seven: EDI Amin]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

[Chorus]
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing there (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I decieve give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
[Chorus]
Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our seperate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's think of the evil break don't make it scandoulous
Try to be mature til your sure that we can handle this
Your sayin I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fightin back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl...don't you trust me?
[Chorus]
I hangup the phone (click)
I can't barely hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)
Just set me back my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breakin out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not becuase we rushed it (hell no)
But girl don't you trust me?

Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?

Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I Try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thugging
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on telling me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearing peeps
? wrapped in my sheets
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me

The game is getting deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminising
And having flashbacks when them niggas came up missing
(Wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Running silly through the court) They don't really wanna start
(How you wanna do?) Yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime)
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting
(Cause it ain't nothing, Y'all niggas is fronting
Do you really want it? niggas dying...)

Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see

You'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me

[Big Mal with Yak in ()]
Now, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'
Cup? in a flash sittin on that ass (And rarely fold)
Galitter tell 'em bout that trife shit (You wanna fight?
I wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch) bee-yatch!
A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
hustle (And doubled every fucking yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I coulnd't see it
Facing a century in the penatentury but so be it)
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
(Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait) No time for stalling (But death is calling)
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start falling
(True, what I do from sun up) is for a come up
(Wake up with my gun up) Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
(So It's time to spray like Ray
And put the freeze on these fake Gs) You know how we do

Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)
[2Pac]
We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin what you thinkin but you musta been the ship
cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
but supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin back, for everything you owe
[Chorus: sung]
I'm comin collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin and duckin
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin
[2Pac over Chorus]
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!!
Psssh
[2Pac]
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin at my innocent family, say they lookin for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin bout, ""Where is the quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed ""Nigga motherfucker""
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin this in federal prison, givin everything I owe

Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin permanent twistin I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin when I did
Steady yellin out spots for me to hit, and aww shit
Soon as I seen her saw us playin hide the weiner
Wanna ""Freak Like Me,"" fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, can I come inside
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
when I walked by, I said, ""Hi""
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin first, and that ain't no fair exchange
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
You do me
And if it's worth it baby I'll return the favor
And give it back to you
A fair exchange, on everythang

Give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang

Open your legs
Got me watchin like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willin, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin me no favors, fair exchange
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin pussy, but baby you gettin dick!
And since you bein laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin like you can't hear the bed shakin
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggie style steady pumpin on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin like you did somethin, givin me a piece
I had you mufflin your screams in the sheets, fuckin with me

They love to G a nigga young dumb and gettin riches
What the fuck you think a trick is nigga
Nigga done stick and wet his dick

I'm here to school you to the rules of the game, it'll cost ya
Think you alla that just cause she let a nigga toss her
It's like a motherfuckin priveledge
So don't give up your conversation, give that bitch your 7 digits
When she call ya, ask that tramp whassup
And if she is the type of nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucking mack tonight
Stay that stay strapped cause my raps is tight
You fuckin punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches
(God, damn! You can't just hit them niggaz with that game
and expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless.
But we gonna kick this shit like this here)

Broke hoes runnin round yellin ""Gimme!""
I can't stand it, hoes talkin bout they got a man
Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later
Fly how I fade her, played her like a game of Sega
Fuckin with the player that done made her, huh
And I ain't sleepin caught you creepin for my money
Got the dick and now you get the pistol honey (bitch)
So get the bozack, knockin hoes back, keep my dough stacked

Something worth dying for
It's been nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
[Verse 1: Tupac]
Though we exist and breathe
Some believe currency comes to g's
Stresses half the ghetto
With success comes greed [echo]
They got me hot
When they shot me
Plotted
My revenge
To increase my ends
Enemies gettin dropped
Win or lose
Red or blue
We must all stay true
Play the game nigga
Never let the game play you
And for the fame [echo]
Niggas change fast [echo]
That's a shame [echo]
What's the game
Lost souls
Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? [echo]
The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane [echo]
I'm hoping we can change with time
I'm living blinded [echo]
Searching for a ?? curse
I know death follows me
But I murder him first
And worse yet
With each breathe
Steps I take
Breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes
Coaster
Crystal glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards
With a ski mask
I'm the first one to warn them
Blast it
Wrapped in plastic
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws)
Ain't nothing left now
Treated like a stepchild
Was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck em all)
Be rocking beats
Fake in fame
[Verse 2:]
Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves
No love for these fake desperados
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts
Sipping Henney
Drunk nights
And hot days
Cocking my heat
Shooting it sideways
A wife on the run
Full of common blunts
Unconditionally married
To my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny
On knees
And ones desires
Be pulling all my cabbage
Like priors
Stuck in the trance
Searching for something higher
Fortune and fame
[Chorus]
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame (FAME)
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
It's been nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
[Verse 3:]
Searching for fortune and fame
Lost in the rain
A lose of the game
With life the cost of the game
We forcing the change
Mother fuck flossing the chain [echo]
All the blame
Belongs to the part of the brain [echo]
That we never use nigga
Plus my heart is in pain [echo]
And if I ever lose homey
Bet I'm at it again [echo]
Outlaws don't die
So united we stand [echo]
And if family 'come a foe
All the fortune and fame [echo]
[Verse 4: Napoleon]
As I walk up in the crib
Laid to rest me head
Say some rhymes to angels
Hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down
Outta town
I sent him a kite today
Man that hate in your heart
Your gotta cleanse it dog
Praying for my downfall
And I can sense it dog
I was passed down the street fame
Like glocks clocked
And keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded
But still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man
But you is a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got
From generation of game
In the road of life dog
We need to switch up lanes
Think about it

One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame (FAME)
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
It's been nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
[Verse 5:]
I can't complain
I've seen my fair share of the fame
It wont change me
Now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange
I got so use to the hood
That when I finally got out
At first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby
Still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit
Ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me
I made myself
Poverty raised me
Thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health
My mind
And my family too
State of myself
My grind
And my family crew
Where one hand watches the other
No we ain't blood
But we still real brothers
The struggle is real
Nothing can steal
What we build
And that remains the same
'Till that day we killed
And that's real
Life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree
That's fame to me
How about it
[Chorus]
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain
Stuck in this game

Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants

Staring and watchin, me and you one on one (see that)
Picture countless options
Was it prophecy?
Clear as day, visions on top of me (oh my god)
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body (yes, yes, yes)
Far from a quest I wanna bust your guts
And touch everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen (come here baby, come here!)
Got my hands on your thighs now let me in-between

Was it me or the fame?
My dick or the game?
Bet I scream 'westside' when I came (westside!)
Scream my name
Cause baby it's the licoius ghetto weak spot, for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back dip into it, make it fluent
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high! Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hatin niggaz cause they cock block (cock block)
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision with the game
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor, and weed
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's a fuck song check the record (so check my record)

Fuck 'em...Fuck all y'all
[Verse 1]
Money gone fuck friends
I need a homie that know me
when all these muthafuckin' cops be on me
I got problems ain't nobody calling back
now what the fuck is happenin' with my ballin' cats
Remember me I'm ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy hanging with the clowns and
all we used to do is drink brew, screw and common knew
we had bitches by the dozens oh we fuckin' cousins
You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc
a nigga just got paid and we still was broke
It took time but finally the cash was mine
all the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and faces
like scavengers waitin' to take a hustler's pape's
and when you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and can't be trusted fuck y'all
[Chorus]
Fuck all y'all [2x]
[Verse 2]
I'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice and what's the use
cause I'm a hopeless thug
Ain't no love reminiscing on how close we was
way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
and heeyyy how much money can you stack in a day
It's gettin' rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life scrawled all across the wall
and all about my dollars make me wanna holla
drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark
these marks keep on huffin' and puffin'
ain't no fear in my heart
What's going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater smokin' chocolate thai
In 94 I'll be going solo
too many problems with my own
so I'm rolling do-do
Fuck all y'all
[Chorus 3x]
[Verse 3]
I went from rags to riches quick
to socializing with the baddest bitches
went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' Gloriaaaa doin' 90 'cause I wanna
I'm getting high like I said it with some chocolate thai
mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
hit the weed and uh I continue doing 90 (Biotch)
will I get caught another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
but I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
got me locked in these chains
and hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout
soon as I hit the cell I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screaming Thug Life nigga fuck y'all

Hahaha yeah nigga, fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
Fuck all you muthafuckers
Ay Yo Biggie Put your hands up
[Verse 1: Tupac]
Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to muthafuckers
When they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer
Affiliation with death row
Niggaz get their caps pealed back
Fool this the west coast
Fuck a misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks
That thought I quit
Then got a drop top jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggaz to trip
Cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga
With love niggaz
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines
Writing raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks now they all want to sue me
So Fuck em' all
[Chorus]
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)
(Young Noble) Come put your hands up in the air, it's a middle finger affair, yeah

[Verse 2: Kadafi]
Now could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak
Even the baddest be gettin murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets
like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison
wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell
a possibility of livin' well
But if they killin' me
I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosing to sell
I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figga addicted to these fucking streets
[Verse 3: Edi]
Now put your muthafucking hands up
If you'se a rider (ride)
Niggaz ain't killers
So they hidin'
Why?
Fuck em' all, touch em' all
That's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man I'm as strong as this game
Ya'll be knowing my name (Edi)
A young high strung thug nigga
Created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane
Gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash and my next piece of ass
So fuck em' all
[Chorus]
(That's right bitch, Fuck em' all)

Cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessey
So they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar

Ridin' these hoochies
Like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For the profit pick my glock up
I'm bustin' in self defense ya see
Poppin' nobody got em'
Holla Outlaw riders
Mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene
Count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers
The swat team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy
Why? Cause they'll never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger
bust some body in the movie
Now I want to do it too
Ohh, ohh niggaz is too through
True to the game
I claim Outlaw riders
We give a fuck what they try
I'm...
[Verse 5: Young Noble]
Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggaz for they watch and chain
Kick back lil nigga
And watch the game
Get your mobb rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin' like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot
Trust me
[Verse 6: Napoleon]
Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X with the tek's
Shower some slugs on em'
I've got a brother don't rest
And he keep some drugs on him
Always in grind mood
Hustle to find food
Ever seen faces of death
That's what my nine do
[Verse 7: Kastro]
I keep my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
With my back against the wall
Like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat
I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world
This guerilla team of mine
Screamin'
Thug Life Bitch, Fuck em' all
(That's right bitch, Fuck em all)
And die for em'
Even if them the last nigga left I'ma ride for em'
Feel me?
Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
Fuck em' all
Let them die
That's my slogan
Fuck em' all

Throw your hands in the air
Everybody just throw your hands in the air)
Let's be friends..
(Wessyde in this motherfucker right here, Wessyde..)
[2Pac]
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? (Whassup?) Come get with me and perhaps lady
you can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship (hey)
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitatin actin like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink (bling bling bling)
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sippin on Cristal and Alize
Smokin on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Puttin bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tuggin on yo' main bitch head (C'mere baby, Wessyde!)
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke daily (come on y'all) baby let's be friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at? come on)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (where the bitches at, where the niggaz with money?)

You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (cash makin hoes)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
[2pac]
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin for you hardcore; starin and watchin
Me and you one on one (see that bitch) picture countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we posess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin like a fat girl goin for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs now
Let me in between as friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (wessyde, motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch (Ha hah!)
Was it me or the fame? My dick or the game?
Bet I scream WESSYDE when I came (wessyde, ha ha ha)
Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot
for pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high! Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride! (let me ride!)
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player hatin niggaz cause they cock block (cock block)
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a livin out of cuss words, liquor, and weed
A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizin, seein you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record
And let's be friends
(Where my niggaz at? Show me where my niggaz at?
Where my bitches at) Thug style!

[2Pac]
My seductive introduction be specific, still elusive
but exclusive's what I give you when I kick it, and I'm still lifted
Niggaz can't get with Mr. Wicked
Picture me flippin my adversaries, gettin the dick swiftly
Niggaz are swingin wild, but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch but ya whole click'll still get treated shitty
Business never personal I'm up before the sun come up on thai
Just a ghetto star, a dropped up double-R is what I'm ridin
Nigga, if you was half the man yo' bitch was, bring you artillery
when you come for me, cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast, cause Syke was bustin
plus, Bow had 'em duckin, screamin, ""Get they cash!""
So now I got the law on me, my phone's tapped
So I had to send word through my lil' homies
Tell them niggaz this the year when they pull the trigger
Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin, wit the wrong nigga..
This is what you get, when you fuckin wit the wrong nigga..
Hehehehe, yeah nigga, peep it
Before I lay me down to sleep I, pray and thank the Lord
for givin me another fruitful, dayyy
I wanna be a peaceful man but still when niggaz come for me
all I can see is gettin 'em, killed
For real it's how I feel, reflect my thoughts, flowin on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peeled
We still cool but you played yourself
Give him the mac and make him spray hisself, heyyy
Fallin legends clutchin chrome three-five-seven
Puttin two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in heaven
Why call in shots nobody really as clear as me
Ain't tryin to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death, so my true niggaz show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why they fuckin wit the wrong nigga, y'know?
It's like..
Why you fuckin wit the wrong nigga..
I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Learned my mathematic skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die cause we tried peace
I die in these streets, blast 'til they recognize
Still do or die, all my niggaz gettin high watchin time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can't stop it
Then keep it poppin lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked yo' bitch and now this new shit gon' fade 'em all
My niggaz ball made a call for some backup
for lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
Buck buck was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby bring the black hearse
Shoulda never fucked around busta, how you figure?
Makin moves on the wrong nigga, is what it sounds like
Ding ding ding.. when you fuck wit the wrong nigga..
Niggaz gettin hit, when they fuck, wit the wrong nigga..
Fuckin wit the wrong nigga..

If I could recelect before my hood dayz
I would sit in bliss and reminis on the good dayz.
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They stressed and goin under.
We never really went through that
Cause we was born ??
Today things change,its a shame
They blame it on the youth cause the truth look strange
For them its worse, we come from a world thats cursed
And it hurts.
Cause any day theyll push the button.
And yall condemned like malcom x and uncle bob
They died for nothin.
Make the people teary, the world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes you see it clearley.
Theres no need for you to fear me.
If you take the time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me.
It aint about black or white, cause we human
I hope you see the light before its ruiend
My ghetto gospel
[Chorus x3]
It ok, its ok, its ok
My ghetto gospel
[2Pac]
Tell me do you see that old lady she aint sad
Living out a bag, in rags, loving the things she has
Over there see that lady, the cracks got her crazy.
And shes gonna give birth to a baby?
I shouldnt let it fade me. we out of the projects
Jumped into another form of slavery.
And even now i get discouraged.
I wonder if its tooken all back will i still keep the courage.
I refuse to be a role modle.
I keep control on the hoes and take out my old bottle.
I make mistakes, i learn from everyone.
And when its said and done, ill be called a better one.
If i strecth you dont stretch.
Never forget, god is gonna finish with me yet.
I feel his hands on my brain.
When i write ryhmes, i go blind, and let the lord do this thing.
But am i any less holy,
I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
And then world peace, we tried and failed
Now theres war in the streets
My ghetto gospel.
[Chorus x3]
[2Pac]
I remember grandmas hands use to hold me
Mold me, i never forget the things she told me
Brothas a butt, and played the big shot
But you know grannys are the only other thing lil ghetto kids got.
Moms work, and pops burried.
Drop me off at grannys, left without a heart cause shes worried
And ghetto grannys are like books.
We got some many crooks, so many grannys gettin shook.
And gettin trapped in a nursing home.
Times is hard, and even worse alone
And how could you be so cold,
Youll get your turn, as soon as you turn old.
All they ask of every person,
Is for a brotha to figure whats on his mind when hes cursin.
9 out of 10 youll find them problems.
Time to take listen and see what you can do to solve them.
Cause every body needs a little help
On the way of relieng on ones self.
And think about it, why 2pac hit you with a little ghetto gospel
My ghetto gospel.
[Chorus x3]
[2Pac]
I wake up stone cold gangsta main
See ya gave me ghetto gospel, i thank you main
Use to roll in the back and do drugs a lot.
Now im bangin the tracks, slangin ryhmes i got.
In this world of greed tryin to succeed on my beliefs.
Now i lay me down to sleep, lord can you hear me speak.
Can you forgive me for my sins
If i had it all to do again, id still play to win
I hope the lord can understand me.
A mans gotta do what he can for his family.
And pay the price of being hellbound.
But i ratha see hell later than see hell now.
And the devil aint got nothin on the president.
Cut back and keep us tsrapped in our residence.
And be like animals in cages.
We can rant and rave about slavery for ages.
Or we can stop makin awful
And hitem with a lil ghetto gospel
My ghetto gospel.

While I remain inside a paradox

Though gun shots is promised to me when will I stop

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
when she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, can't peep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-OH!) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mausberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
[Chorus: 2Pac]

A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin to my fuckin block
Took a shot, tired of runnin from the niggaz and the cops

Right here, Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead & buried nigga
Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt & a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time
My epitaph will read ""Was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead""

I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police & all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
By keepin gun & never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead

Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin, so I'm flowin goin crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk

Deceivin those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath

I ain't the nigga to put you up on, cause word in bond
When I was broke I had to hustle till dawn
That's when sun came up
There's only one way up, hold ya head stay up
To all my nigga's
get ya pay and wait up
Castro
If it's on then it's on,
we rate B-breaks
Outlaws on a paper chase,
can you relate
to this shit I don't got,
be the shit I gotta take
Dealin wit fate
Hoping God don't close the gate.
Repeat
Chorus and Verse
We've been traveling on this wavy road,
long time life can be a heavy load
but we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everything with corine
We free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everything with corine
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin from the Penitentiary
This is the time for reliberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
Westside, Outlawz, Makaveli tha Don, Solo, Killuminati, The 7 Dayz

This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
Let's turn this house into a happy home
Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Let's turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for mine
Outlaw.. look
[2Pac]
Now we've been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin Alize and Cristal, whylin every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
it's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home
[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home..
(let's turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..

Goin through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin, a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home
[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(finally got to live the good life, inside a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..

Happy home
[singers]
All these problems got me goin
We got a family, of our own
I just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize

See you got some niggas on your side
That say they your friends But in real life they your enemies
And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money
See the enemies say the truth
But in real life those niggas will be the snitches

Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with
and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby
Keep your mind on your riches
9-1-1 its a emergency cowards tried to murder me
From the hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar and cowards die
My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit thats what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinite Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
like a south paw you gettin left
And every breath I breathe untill the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd then I start again
Internally I live in sin untill the moment
that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men
The Heartz of Men
My lyrical verge with so much pain that
To some niggas it hurts My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll and fly mode
I'm an homicidal outlaw and five-o get your lights on
Fight long, tonights gonna be a fucking fight so we might roll
My own homies saying I'm heart less
But I'm a G to this 'til the day I'm gone thats regardless
Drive-by and niggas bow down
I thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if your thugged out
First nigga act up first nigga getting drugged out
I can be a villian if yah let me
I'll Mutha fuck yah if yah too upset me
tell the cops to come and get me
rip the crowd like a phone number
Start again, don't have no mutha fuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men
In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men
To all me niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a Don
If niggas is having problems smoke fire and bomb them
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if its a game of crack
Thugishness is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing scar'd up but still flowing
energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate that makes a sick mutha fucka break
On these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake
What will it take
Give me that bass line I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga beat and let me start again
Represent cause I've been sent

Heaven ain't hard to find
(All you gotta do is look)
[Tupac]
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, eleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down ?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
across the nation
""Mr. I get around""
My temptation got me dripping wet
perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find
[Chorus]
(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
Heaven ain't hard to find
Infact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of scarifice
with all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug ?
and have you ever made love
with candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your bloodpressure
This Thug Passion
help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay
come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends
perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find
[Chorus]
(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
You think we all dogs, thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me
whats all that ? Huh
its like the closer you get, Baby the quicker I'm speaking
I got a flight out Chicago, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Heneesee and coke
tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends
I can soup you in my Benz
we'll ride
I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

[all parts with Lady Levi speaking are strictly best guess]
[1] [Eboni Foster] Game's been good to me
[2] [Eboni Foster] I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me
[Lady Levi]
Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, everytime seen?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin to make a livin
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bitches
who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, playa-hatin but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, niggaz know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo
Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin poppin 'bout no work nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game [1]

Who da bumba claat him a come try take mine?
Oooh, me see you rushin up [1]

All, all da bumba come ya take dis ting
for ya take dis ting for joke? [2]
Oh! Dat's right
[Verse Two: Richie Rich]
Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of shit..
Certain niggaz wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggaz be twistin and takin shit
Puttin they sack down, then puttin they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own nigga meanin buy yo' own dope
Cause that front shit is punk shit, somethin I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
ain't healthy, niggaz be endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin major
so what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga livin residential
to a, young nigga workin presidential [1]
[Lady Levi]
Me nigga Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'im look good every time
Ooh, pussy war? Step up [1]
Can yi know I'm servin up blood claat
playin yi fuckin games
Ooh, we take game, we WON [2]
Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin high, gettin mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggaz I despise -- them loud talkin cowards
shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot em right between them niggaz eyes, it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin to make the news, niggaz confused
Quit tryin to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
and come the riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game [1]
[Lady Levi]
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good everytime
when we at Beers Diamond
and Tupac drives vintage car [1]
And fi dem frame dem look good, oh no?

For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!

Nobody wan come test me y'know

Wanna no part of any ting

But ya see we know, you haffa show 'im MAXIMUM respect

Get on your knees and pray
Increased the doses
Bustin' whoever's closest
Thug livin'
hell; a prison
Never loosin' my focus
I'm making moves mandatory
And in disscussion
My past records tell a story
Picture niggas be rushing and still bustin'
TIl the cops come running
Duck in abandoned buildings
Ditching my gun
Hope what a motherfucking feeling
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers
But now legitless
So I laugh til I'm crying
When the lord come get me
NO baby momma drama
Nigga miss me
While I plant seeds
In a dirty bitch watching to trick me
Another life for me
Living carefree
til I'm buried
And if they dare me
I bust on them nigga's until they scurry
I'm clearly a man of military means
Through my artilery
Watching over me through every murder scene
From adolecense to my early teens
Though we was born to ddie
I""m selling dope to all the feene's
At times I wanna cry
And still we try to change the past in vain
Never knowing if this game 'ill last
Feeling ashamed of cocaine
the product of the devil
Am I selling me soul?
Kept at a small time living
Nigga telling me No
I got mine fuck them other suckers
Thats the mentality
Jealous ass busta's
Making hell for a hustler
Chorus Oh help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
*help me change my ways*
I was raised this way
I never let they play me for a busta
Making hell for a hustler
*While's I'm in this place*
Help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
*on judgement day*
I was raised this way
I never let them play me for a busta
Making hell for a hustler
Now when we slang at times
I takes mine so serious
GOtta get that paper quickkly
and escape the sickness
If I fail
Being broke is hell for a hustler
SO I stay struggling and juggling
With all the might I can I musta
Since a youngstah been money hungry
Moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
SO I said my side bigger
Four figga's or mo'
Real nigga fo' sho'
What you thought
All's Fo
Lost homies in many battles
Last two years shed plenty tears
And now set plenty action
Let me catch you slippin'
You soft nigga's outta here
In case you forgot
We got the same shit they gotta get
Every step I take
Every sale I make
Every meal I ate
Head to head whoever hustle hardest
On the block ducking charges
Nigga fuck the sargeant
GOt a job
All my battles got a picture;cope
Listen though
I'm if-in though
GOtta give 'em mo'
Hell No
I've did blocks with red tops
But now a nigga sell
Word to my young thugs
In jail and jury
They made it hell for a hustler
My bail's high as fuck son
Dying luck none
Supplies with much guns
I bucked one
Just to let you know
That I can touch one
So I can crack the wrath
Still hell for a hustler
NO insanity plee for me
I ride the beef 'til i burn
Since in me
Embarge from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile
Guess you can call me anti-social
NIgga's shaking
Like they caught the holly ghost
When I approach 'em
Try and pause it before I smoke them
Like Sazu
Nigga's doing to these snitches before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
Best believe they comming for my dogs in the morning
And if I die by slug
The death of a true thug
Telling me when my migga's moaning
Getting blown out
High watch me murder then burn
Before he testify, strikes
Or get close to my thug
I live a troubled life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens
Drug dealers to X-feene's
Keep your eyes on the prize
Watch for busta's
Either heaven or jail
It's still hell for a hustler
Chorus
2x's
This is how we ride
Not knowing if we live or die
Catching me rolling with my mother fucking guns on my side
In case of drama
I'm the first break wild on 'til they all die

(Yes) change my ways (yes)
ANd black Jesus got us through this
Weary, weary, weary, weary heart
Only god can save us
Nothing but ball..s playa's

Mama raised a hellrazor... born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class
and I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
and mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black

While the po' babies restin in the early graves

Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen

Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end

Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high

And if you got it you getting wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit

I speak
For all my niggaz livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright
[2Pac + E.D.I Amin]
Life in High Speed
Fuck the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
Fuck doin' time
[2Pac]
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthafuckas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me
My army, niggaz decieve swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna hang out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthafuckin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less it's without protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past, blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the D.A., be heavensent
Switched like a stone-bitch, turned str8 severed then, why?
Then they wonder why niggaz die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime rate, this is hell
Bail out, a thug nigga fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and tie weed
Puffin' through these High Speedz
And people say
Chorus (2Pac):
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night

Verbal assassin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
I plan to stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to slippin'
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's soft as tissue
I ride plottin' like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that ass attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Grab your shots', callin'
Catchin niggaz while they stormin'
Kickin' his door in
And get your whole fuckin' family a' mournin'
Plus all you itchy-bitchy types can't touch me
Frontin' like your hard
I'll play your fuckin' yard like a trussel

Wonderin' why it keeps on passin' bringin' me the danger
No singal hard time is a good one
At times I'm amazed
Now what the mutha fuck a hood done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
Niggaz is dying tommorrow
We, bet on all time
Nigga the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you only know your glocks spittin
Cops sittin', politicians passin' laws you ain't knowin'
Soon that money goin' be illegal when you got it
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like ya'll, I worry 'bout that shit later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up nigga, blaze
Lets get blowed out High Speed til the end of my dayz

Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on

Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on

Cause when it's on it's on but
But believe me when I tell you
Hold on, and be strong

Cause when it's on it's on but

Hold on, and be strong

When I'm burried
Knowing deep inside me
Only if yah love
Come rush me to the gates of heaven
Let me picture for a while
How I live for my days, as a child
I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold Your head
[Chorus]
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
To many young black brothers are dying
Living Fast, too fast
These felonies be like prophecies
Begging me to stop
Cuz These lawyers getting money
Everytime they knock us
Slashing pockets lyrically
Suckas fleed when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli
Had the rap game closed
Expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows
They froze
Now suckas idealize my choosen Blows
More money mean litigating
More Playa hating
Got a cell at the penn for me waiting
Is this my fate
Miss me with that mistermeaner thinking
Me fall back
Never That
Too much Tequilla drinking
We all that
Make them understand me
Hey I'll stay all night out with my Posse
Everyone roll with me is family
Cuz everybodies got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision
This life we living
Got us all meeting up in Prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog
Written in Blood
Saying, ""Please show a young playa love""
Hold your head
Hold it
[Chorus]
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
To many young black brothers are dying
Living Fast, too fast
God bless the child that can hold is own
Indeed
Enemies Bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be to last
to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation
In this world of greed
Currency means nothing if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy
Take the game from me
I hope for better days
Trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities
Till they capture me
And my AIM is to spread more smiles than tears
Utilalize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right
Rest your head
Straight converstion all night
Bless the dead
To the homies that I usta have
That no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul
Watching time pass
Through the glass of my drop top
Hold your head
[Chorus]

on tha verge of furious
i'm addicted to currency
nigga that's why we're doin this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
and then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
it's a celebration
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
will I be great, is it my fate
to live tha life of luxury
some niggas bought my tapes
so much jelousy it scares me
so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isn't fair (fair)
probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me

Gotta be Carefull, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me

(Ohhhhhh....)
I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
only her and I know
now i'm sitten' in tha state pen
doin time for slow
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin'
just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin'
cause
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from tha coppers
but never let'em stop me
cause i'm a soulja
hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
of one day getting older

[Verse One]
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -

To the sell-outs, livin it up
One way or another you'll be givin it up, huh
I guess cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They fell me when they rollin in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble -

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -

Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh
for them niggaz that be Johnny Dangerous when they be fuckin fifty deep
But they be fuckin cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin about
(You know who I'm talkin about) that's right
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Now
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
Nigga it's a god damn shame, somebody explain
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggaz aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't shit without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggaz is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggaz is punks, you ain't shit without your homeboys
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherfucker
[Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac shittin ya box
You was lookin real weak walkin down the street
Now a nigga thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it, what's this you the only scared one
(faggot ass) Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
Niggaz be actin all different when they dogs come around
Watch em act like bitches when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy
[2Pac]
You ain't shit without your homeboys
My thug niggaz, I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death, we ain't shit without our homeboys
.. You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboys
Hey, tell em the story how you came up nigga
Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggaz is so close, it's complicated
One nigga smokin and drinkin, and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggaz cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me
Bustin with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
Niggaz fiendin, I got em comin back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggaz be together
Ain't shit without your homeboys
Thug niggaz I love niggaz
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my niggaz to death
We ain't shit without our homeboys
Love you niggaz to death

Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die
then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends

And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato ?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie

All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up

See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me ?

Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me ?

*New 2Pac Verse*
So many,
burried peers, throughout the years
while pouring out liquor and beers
for my homies that wasnt here.
cant help but shed tearz at the cemetary
makin me wonder if this loaded pistols neccesarry.
even the preacher could see the pain in my mothers eyes.
while walkin bye, cant help but sympathize when brothas die.
maybe the pain will make the situation change.
no murder for murder, our homicide will never end, this crooked game.
bullets blastin, time pass, brothas in masks
retaliation is the aftermath.
all that remains is a courpse rapped in plastic.
call the mother tell her her babies in a casket.
no love fo'em
put his body in the grave
even the pistols and all the prayers couldnt savem
look how they played'em
they should have murderd me when i was born.
now im caught in the violence of the storm.
how long will they mourn me.

Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry
instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die
then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn)
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me ?
[Chorus]
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Nate Dogg)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke)
[Syke]
How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato ?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day
ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me ?
[Chorus]
I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me
(It's still on nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Yeah)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)
[Rated R]
Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Reminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me ?
Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me ?
[Chorus]
Yeah!
I wish it would have been another
(Mack 10 in this muthafucka)
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother
(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit,
Nate Dogg do that shit nigga)
I wish it would have been another
Yeah! How long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my brother
(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids)
How long will ya mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will ya mourn my brother

I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it takes
for any of ya'll niggas to get up out tha hood
Shit, I'm with ya
I ain't mad at cha
got nothin' but love for ya
do your thing boy
Yeah, All the homies that I ain't talked to in awhile
I'm a send this out to y'all
know what I mean
Cuz, I ain't mad at cha
heard all of y'all
tearing up shit out there
Kickin' up dust
givin' a mutha-fuck
Yeah, niggas
Cuz, I ain't mad at cha
Now, we were once two niggas of the same kind
quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You were just a little smaller
but you still rolled
Got stressed the [Wide Eight]
and hit the hood stroll
remember when ya had a Jerry Curl
Didn't quite learn
On the block
With ya glock
trippin' of Sherm
Collect calls to the tip
Sayin' how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now
No more dope game
Heard you might be coming home
Just got bail
wanna go to the Mosque
Don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie
He's a changed man
Hit the penn
Now, no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money
All you see is the struggle
When I tell ya, I'm livin' large
you tell me, its trouble
Congratulation on the wedding
I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life
And that's no bullshitin'
I know we grew apart
You probably don't remember
I usta fiend for your sister
But never went up in her
And I can see us after school
We'd bomb on the first mutha-fucka
with tha wrong shit on
And now, the whole shits changed
and we don't even kick it
got a big money scheme
And you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart
You were the same mutha-fucka bad
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll
You got a brothas back
And I can't even trip
cause i'm just laughin' at ya
You tryin' hard to maintain
And go ahead
Cuz, I ain't mad at cha
Chorus -- Danny boy
oooowwwwww
I ain't Mad at Cha
(I ain't Mad at Cha)
I ain't Mad at Cha
We used to be like distant couzins
fightin', playin' dozins
whole nieghborhood buzzin'
Knowin' that we was wasn't
Usta catch us on the roof
or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitz
reminiscin'
On all the time we shared
Beside
Bumpin' n' Grindin'
Was nothin' on our mind
In time we learned
to live a life of crime
Rewind us back
To a time
Was much to young, to know
I caught a felony
lovin' the way the guns blow
And even thou we seperated
You said that you wait
Don't give nobody no coochie
While I'll be locked up state
I Kiss my mama good bye
Wipe, the tears from her lonely eyes
Said, that I'll return
But I gotta fight
The bitch that ride
Don't shed a tear
cuz, mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trails
and no more smiles
for a couple a years
They got me goin' mad
I'm knocking brothas on their backs
in my cell
Thinkin' hell
I know one day I'll be back
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl i'll be there
so prepare
to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it
But I'm just laughin' at ya
Cuz, you is a down ass bitch
and I ain't mad at cha
Chorus -- Danny boy
I ain't Mad at Cha
(I ain't Mad at Cha)
I ain't Mad at Cha
(but your a down ass bitch, and I ain't Mad at Cha)
Well guess who's moving up
this niggas ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it
Hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to alot
Ten Karets the spot
He went from a nobody nigga
to the big man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity
Addicted to move a key
most hated by enemy
Escaping the luxury
See, first you was our nigga
But you made it
So the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you
while you faded
In the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off the bomb
Hopin' we can make it
To the better dayz
Cuz, crime pays
And in time
You'll find a rhyme
That'll blaze you'll feel the fire
from the niggas in my younger dayz
So many changed on me
So many tried to plot
that I keep a glock
beside my Haaand
When will it stop
'Till god return me to my essence
Cuz, even as a adolecents
I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions,
And they ask me if i'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto
So I ain't real now
They got so much to say
But I'm just laughin' at ya
You niggas just don't know
But I ain't mad at cha
Chorus -- Danny boy
oooowwwwww
I ain't Mad at Cha
(I ain't Mad at Cha)
I ain't Mad at Cha
(Hell naw, I ain't mad at Cha)
I ain't Mad at Cha
(and I ain't Mad at Cha)
I ain't Mad at Cha
(I ain't Mad at Cha)

It seems I can't turn back
I'm walkin round strapped can't sleep, My enemies want me gat
Call my mama and they scream drama [Kill you bitch!]
Could it be they don't know that they fuckin wit a G? [Rat-a-tat]
I'm goin to sleep but wit my eyes open
I'm gettin high and I pray that when I go, I can die smokin
Go to the funeral, My homie's dead, He passed away
Got caught up in the wrong place, Got blasted hey
It's just anotha part of bein black
It ain't no thang, But if you slang, You betta watch yo back
Cause these motherfuckers love to see you gone
You gotta stay strong, Young brotha, Cause it's on
And i'll be slangin these thangs till the break of dawn
Gotta make my ends, Then it's time to take it home
Got some hoochies on my pager
It's major, Let me play her like a game of fuckin sega
It's time to wake up, 2 in the mornin
You gotta leave, Gots to sleep by myself, Cause i'm a G
It's time to say goodbye, I gots to get my strap
I was raised in the gutter now I can't turn back
[Chorus 1: 2Pac]
It seems I can't turn back
They want me to change
But yo, I can't turn back

But now, I can't turn back
[Verse 2: Uncredited Rapper]
I got 30 homies, 30 mackin, Jealous cause i'm stackin
I stay tackin, Keep packin, Heat in case these niggaz get to actin
Too sheisty, Shorty y'all get foggy and wanna leak
Or get restless tryin to test this, Get they ass put to sleep [Pow!]
I'm playin for keeps, And if a life ain't no turnin back
I'ma keep hustlin as long as dope fiends keep burnin crack
No love for these bitches cause when you down and out, They backs turn
Now dig em and ditch em be about my riches, Sip my liquor, And let my sack burn
Can't let these funky cock hoes destroy me
Only quality time I spend in these only blocks that employ me
These punk-ass cops annoy me, Playa hatin on my cash got
Me bailin through them cuts throwin my sack and strappin the stash box
Tryin to crash my spot, Tryin to stop a nigga from earnin snaps
To hustle's all I know so it ain't really no turnin back
[Chorus 1: 2Pac]
I can't turn back
They sayin i'm crazy
I can't turn back
They want me to quit
[Chorus 2: 2Pac]
I can't turn back
They want me to stop
But yo, I can't turn back
[Verse 3: Spice 1]
Comin up off a clip, So nigga don't trip, It's the S-P-I
When I step onto ya shit, Nigga, Ya quick to die
So take this slug to ya chest cause then i'm turnin back
Reason the ghetto smoke a motherfucker slangin crack
I put my finger on trigger and he was rolled up
He was the key to me gettin my spizzot sowed up
So now i'm runnin like a motherfuckin fugitive
And all I carry is memories of how I used to live
[2Pac]
Everytime I wake up, I hit the floor and thank the lord
I don't know what i'm livin for, I'm runnin out the back door
Ain't nothin nice in my life, I ask my nigga Spice [What's up, Nigga]
Don't wanna die, Am I livin right?
I hit the corner smokin weed and drinkin hennessey
Will I be sober enough to see my enemies?
And if I do, Will I empty my clip?
Or will I trip, Cause I ain't givin up shit
I can't turn back
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Can't turn back
They want me to quit
But yo, I can't turn back
They sayin i'm crazy
I can't turn back
They want me to quit
But yo, I can't turn back
I can't turn back

They done push me to the limit the more I live
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin
I see no justice
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watch the hurst past
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snippe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
from the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a physco-path
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I don't give a fuck
Niggas!, isn't just the blacks
also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city
They say niggas like to do niggas,
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me
don't really give a fuck
Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business else where
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than
His pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
AS strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Usta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck
They just don't give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San FranCisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice mutha fuckas
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all

Aw yeah, I get around
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
Stronger than ever

Back to get wreck
All respect to those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
Cause oh they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why, your girl keeps paging me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me, lady take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me, I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo bust it, baby got a problem saying bye bye
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask why, don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's looking for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy
If you wanna see me dial the beeper number baby when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
But when you learn, you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out, I get around

Well I've been hanging sanging, trying to do my thang
Oh, you heard that I was banging
Your home girl you went to school with, that's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't

And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know, that I get around

Why I ain't call you? Ha ha, please
Finger tips on the hips as I dip, gotta get a tight grip, don't slip
Loose lips sink ships, it's a trip
I love the way she licks her lips, see me jocking
Put a little twist in her hips cause I'm watching
Conversations on the phone til the break of dawn
Now we all alone, why the lights on?
Turn 'em off, time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Something's on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweating me?
It's a lot of real G's doing time
Cause a groupy bit the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy baby if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy

I was raised, the little young nigga doin bad shit
Talk much shit cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault papa didn't plan it out
Broke out left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Down the block, got a glock, and I clock grip
Makin G's was my mission
Movin enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen and
why must I sock a fella, just to live large like Rockefeller
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace til the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Two: 2Pac
Here on Earth, tell me what's a blick life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin from the, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
in the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Three: 2Pac
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
one better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals

If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
God damn it's a motherfuckin riot
Black people only hate police so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right but it's long overdue
We can't have peace til the niggaz get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Two: 2Pac
Here on Earth, tell me what's a blick life worth
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties get a lawyer you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, LaTasha, and many more
It's been goin on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, when will the violence cease?
When your troops stop shootin niggaz down in the street
Niggaz had enough time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Word to God cause it's hard tryin to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit now everything's free
so we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin from the, cause for years they would take it from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggaz burned it down
And now Bush can't stop the hit
Predicted the shit, in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggaz, felt good
in the hood bein around the niggaz, yeah
And for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus
Verse Three: 2Pac
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it take to make this
one better place, let's erase the wait state
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
Cause both black and white are smokin crack tonight
And only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black President, huh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth living should I blast myself
I'm tired of being poor and even worse I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a ne-gro
Pull a trigger kill a nigger he's a hero
Mo' nigga mo' nigga mo' niggaz
I'd rather be dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if heaven got a ghetto
Chorus (to :27 from fade)
Just think, if niggaz decide to retaliate
(Soldier in the house)
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto (4X to fade)

Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
that get up every motherfuckin mornin and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggaz laughed, til the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
and now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin ghost on the five-oh, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
and holla five-oj when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hittin fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin one-fifty-five
in the city where the little niggaz die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G
I'm gettin money [4x]
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin
Kinda boomin round the way, think today I make a killin
Dressin down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin from the cops
Gettin high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
drinkin liquor and I'm lookin for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin money, than live poor and legal
as I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G
I'm gettin money [4X]
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
at point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin the dice
Now roll em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G
I'm gettin money [5X]

Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go
[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it
[Chorus]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind

[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it
[Chorus]
[Spice 1]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a lier
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

Keeping the smile off their white fakes

A soldier dies but once
[Verse One]
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturin pitiful punk niggaz coppin pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evadin the playa hatin tricks, while hittin switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm duckin the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin my glock
Niggaz is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight
[Chorus]
If I die tonight [repeat 3X]
""Tonight's the night I get in some shit"" - [Dr. Dre]
[Verse Two]
Polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
Callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
He got it by killer, preoccuppied with bein boss
Revenge is the method, whenever steppin keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
Picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's usin deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seein cemetary photos of my peers
Conversatin like they still here, if I die tonight
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Livin when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggaz
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick, while drinkin liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps, for bein petrified and lame
Disrespectin the game, prayin for punishment and pain
Goin insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy hear
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines readin MURDERED TO DEATH, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight

Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
[Verse Two:]
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call
[Verse Three:]
Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of heat
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call

In the event of my demise
when my heart can beat no more
I hope I die for a princeple
Or a belief that I have lived for
I will die before my time
Beacause I feel the shadow's depth
So much I wanted to acomplish
Before I reached my death
I have to come to grips with the possibility
And wiped the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who were positive
In the event of my demise
[Young Noble]
In the event of my demise don't shed no tear
I'll share my wizdom with the world, they'll know I was here
Know I was clear, every thing I said I ment
A outlaw, when I was born they prepared my ditch
Said I won't live long, statistic showed
I'm tryna past 24 realistic goal, listen all
You gotta stay cold inside
That's what I tell myself when I feel alone sometime
But I can't cry, I don't tear no more
I love god, from death I don't fear no more
A part taken in this movment to better my people
Though they see me on TV, I tell them we equal
Don't look at me as a stranger, I'm one of your own
We was rised in concrete and grew as a rose
Still I rise, but never get a chance to fly
Mama please don't cry
In the event of my demise

In the event of my demise
can't breathe no more
hope I die for a princeple
something I lived for
dying before my time
feel the shadows of depth
Trying to fulfill all my dreams before I reach my death
came to grips with the possibility
The world's killing me, and my soldiers die young with no sympathy
I wipe the last tear from my eyes
I loved all who stand strong
In the event of my demise
[Napoleon]
If I should die before I awake
let my family be stairght of the money I make
Give my son, what he needs, other than his father
Is it self respect, better get his honor
with the law come to swallow my soul, it's so big
Cause the street took enough of my life, we all see
It's a cycle make you feel psycho
Everything struggles behind this man, see nobody love you
Got a piece of the streets and it's gonna die with me
may your, soul forgive me
Makaveli's within me
In principle we stand by stronger than power
We gon' die by the rules you can never devour
On the earth from my birth fell nothing but pain
only thing I ever gave was the baby the name
that's my heart, and if I should go I'll go on in sparks
that's the event of my demise, and it lurks in the dark
[Chorus]
[??]
Now as I stand here, a man here
Not a perfect one, but a searching one
Seek in another, blazing time
Sound crazy but I'm actually tryin to escape my mind
Tryna rise in time
but hoping that you didn't notice
When i was at my low as
So I knew they were watching, I couldn't stop it
So many things I wanted to accomplish
Too many dreams, wasted with no promise
From out the darkness I struggle to see the light
Rumble deep in the night
Hustlin with all of my might
Some won't see it that way
But us is given praise
But all of them will dream
That I did it my way
In the event of my demise
[E.D.I. Amin]
I was born to a storm that won't lead up
And I was rased to stay brave with my head up
But thing ain't got better
We still gettin wetter in this bad weather
I need more than a sweater and a leather
Yo, ain't nothin ment to last forever
So the stuggling and the ?starving? ain't gon' last forever
And my will, probably be like two lines long
It will read I'm dead but my soul lives on
And my spirit still living though my body is gone
In the event of my demise I love all who stay strong
I love all who stay strong
In the event of my demise, com'on

In the event of my demise

In today's music news: the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
just released another album under the alias Makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album;
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
on Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everbody wants to know is --
why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment
but released this statement:
[Makaveli]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money,
riders and punks. Which side are you on?
[gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground]
These niggaz is still fuckin talkin?
You niggaz still breathin? Fuckin roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for your cockroaches
(All day, everyday)
It's the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(The pump in yo' ass)
This is it nigga! Killuminati style
(Outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the Don, solo shit - bring it!
[Makaveli]
Allow me to introduce first {*gunshot fires*} Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy Qu'Ran
Niggaz get shook like 5-0
My forty-five gun's next to me when we ride, for survival
Money makin plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dopefiend's titty.. huh
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggaz down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggaz duckin from my guillotine stare
I'm right there; my every word, a fuckin nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down.. to Hell is where we send 'em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gon' cry
Me - a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper 'til I'm gone
Thug Life runnin through my veins so I'm strong
(Ha ha ha)
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggaz but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa, Jay-Z die too
Lookin out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggaz down to die for me? Yeahh-yeayy!
West coast ridah, comin right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit meeee
I want money hoes sex and weeeed
I wont rest till my road dawgs freeee, bomb first!
[Chorus]
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
[E.D.I. Amin]
For so many days and some many ways we've been duckin strays
They delivers, but we still some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do
and that's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo I'm dyin with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muh'fuckin Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfuckin cash mayne
then what is your motherfuckin purpose? None can serve us
E.D.I. Amin born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first BEATCH!!
[Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin patent leather
Causin massive terror, y'all niggaz lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin
Yer tellin fairy tales dunn
""King of New York,"" like you the motherfuckin one?
But I'm from Jerz and we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to North Bricks, all my niggaz flippin chips
Gettin rich, even though it's hard
Tryin to creep through these halls and brawls
without scarred by a revolv'
with no warnin signs, cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine, ready to put in my time
[Makaveli]
Shoot first, look at they head burst bleedin
Don't want to hear no shit this evenin, believe me
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first

[Verse One: 2Pac]
I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uhh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin roaches, cause we broke
Late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right
[Chorus: 2Pac]
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free
[repeat 3X]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin
Wake up sweaty and screamin, cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin out for these killer kids, cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin shots
Til I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Til I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy
[Chorus 2.75]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Lately been reminiscin
bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin dreams
of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
through the years tryin to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', casue these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tommorrow, am I fallin off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin, I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
this high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
do I do in these county blues
Gettin battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin in this, livin hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin to torture em to tell, I'm gettin mail
But ain't nobody sayin much, the same old nuts
is makin bucks while these sluts is gettin fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy

[Verse One:]
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots
I give a holler to my sisters on welfare
Tupac cares, and don't nobody else care
And uhh, I know they like to beat ya down a lot
When you come around the block brothas clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive but don't forget, girl keep your head up
And when he tells you you ain't nuttin don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you you should leave him
Cause sista you don't need him
And I ain't tryin to gas ya up, I just call em how I see em
You know it makes me unhappy (what's that)
When brothas make babies, and leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies, that make the babies
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up
I know you're fed up ladies, but keep your head up
[Chorus]
Keep ya head up, oooo child things are gonna get easier
ooooo child things are gonna get brighter [2x]
[Verse Two:]
Aiyyo, I remember Marvin Gaye, used to sing ta me
He had me feelin like black was tha thing to be
And suddenly tha ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew, and had a smoke or two
And I realize momma really paid the price
She nearly gave her life, to raise me right
And all I had ta give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic, and make it to tha bright screen
I'm tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay tha rent
And in the end it seems I'm headin for tha pen
I try and find my friends, but they're blowin in the wind
Last night my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity
It seems tha rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up, and still keep from gettin wet up
You know it's funny when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Say there ain't no hope for the youth and the truth is
it ain't no hope for tha future
And then they wonder why we crazy
I blame my mother, for turning my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive, cause it's a setup
And even though you're fed up
Huh, ya got to keep your head up
[Chorus]
[Verse Three:]
And uhh
To all the ladies havin babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by ya lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids, even if nobody else want em
Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and comeback for more
Cause ain't nuttin worse than when your son
wants to kno why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain you was dealt this
hell of a hand without a man, feelin helpless
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless
While tears, is rollin down your cheeks
Ya steady hopin things don't all down this week
Cause if it did, you couldn't take it, and don't blame me
I was given this world I didn't make it
And now my son's getten older and older and cold
From havin the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin Benz
I'm still tryin to hold on to my survivin friends
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up, but
please... you got to keep your head up

Let it be prophesized; niggaz'll die because ya crew's goon
Around the way niggaz get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
Niggaz is bold and they choose to roll
I kill em all, watch now nigga truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggaz dyin by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these niggaz cross me
I'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, everytime I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga cause I'm comin back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
Lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin niggaz watch they every step
Label me a threat
and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen I'm a ridah
Every nigga breathin pay attention
Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel, to drop a body
The simple gun to my lifestyle, Killuminati

After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin again
Til I make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, bitches that scary, get too near me we rushin
Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and niggaz thug livin
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency, the money be callin
It's like I'm - dreamin, see in season me ballin
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin niggaz pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati
Chorus (w/ minor variations)
[E.D.I. Amin]
I spend most of my time bankin niggaz
because they hate a nigga, comin across fake niggaz
But we made niggaz, old school and I'm thinkin
Y'all some bitch made niggaz and you steadily sinkin
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin fuckin with that
We bustin back comin back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin them fuckers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss niggaz, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati
[Kadafi]
They got me thinkin strugglin and hustling's my only fate
Toppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin to keep that money straight
Times is rollin three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin my deeds
Preocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's simpin naughty thangs
Real as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin right from wrong
They say my ghetto intrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me, for the outcome, ban my records - check it
Don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin blinded
Hennesey got me feelin bad, time to stop drinkin
Rollin, in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin?
Sittin in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry; I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu, that I love her, but it's hard to take
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was

Lookin for a better wayyyyyy..

Hopin God hear me, I entered the game; look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
when I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin time fly; I love my people do or die
But I wonder why, we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga get paid.""
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say, c'mon..
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
[Bad Ass]
God help me out here, cause I'm posessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
Cause money's like a stong prescription drug, it's got me addicted
to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin bout the paper wit the pictures of the president's, head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin money cause it's cursed
Makin money makes a difference day by day so I gotta stay
paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my, peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life doin right, or did life livin dumb
Who has the answers? I wonder; I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road

A million thangs run through my mind..
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin time..

[Malcolm Jamal Warner]
Let me show you, the rhyme..
Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
and so does Mrs. Justice by her side
Both the broads are blind as bats, stumblin through - the system
Justice bumped into M'Tulu, trippin on Geronimo Pratt
but stepped right over Oliver and his crooked partner Ronnie
Justice stubbed her big toe on Mandela
And Liberty was misquoted by the Indians
Slavery was just a learning phase, forgotten without a verdict
while Justice is on a rampage
for endangered survivin black males
I mean really; if anyone REALLY valued life
and cared about the masses
They'd take 'em both to Pen Optical
and get TWO pairs of glasses
Excuse me - but, Lady Liberty needs glasses
I'm kickin asses up and down New York City
It's a pity
Brothers wanna be grimy and gritty to each other
What would your mother think, smotherin your brother?
I see you sink, into another level
Dancin with the devil
Turn up the bass, cause I'm player; also a rhyme sayer
Kind of fly, layer after layer
Why.. cause I'm blessed
Cause I've progressed
I've learned my lessons
Class has always been in session, so you better take notes
And stop chokin on negativity

It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place [ha ha ha]
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it
One nigga teach two niggas
three teach four niggas
And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin
Packed in a suburban, screamin outlaw runin on the curb
They never try me cause right behind me your killer team
I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
This Hennessey'll keep me calm though
Sittin in the back of the club, tradin convo
Livin like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinkin champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin high, wonder why we gotta die smokin
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spendin my nights like its the last one left
I'm an outlaw
[Chorus]
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor

Hey 'Pac, it's yo' boy
Hey man so far I've been listenin to your album
and I ain't heard nuttin you could kick back and smoke a beadie to
You know?
Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?
[2Pac]
I'm barely standin, and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin through the street lights, cause we like, yo nigga
get your mobb on show em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz poppin, welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin for a bitch that's half-black and filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tounge-kissin on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say em right
The club be poppin so I'm stoppin at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the late night

Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain til my socks is damp
Ain't NUTTIN like bein a thug when I can just
sit on the Row of Death straight knowin that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
was poppin like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds
[Kastro]
From bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin
if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night

Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuin mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
in the drop-top Jag', how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic, manditory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I dissapear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
for my niggaz up in Clentin gettin weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin
Slappin niggaz known for tellin bitches FUCK-IT in the late night

Let knowledge drop
Why should I be forced to play dumb?
I know where I came from so I'm going to claim some
But rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
Suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
Stop think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Move on be strong with unity
Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo lives must move on
And never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop
[Chorus]
Drop that [3x]
Let knowledge drop
[Rock]
Yo I'm running so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
So listen up to the flavor I gave you now dropping it
We folks know ballers know no stopping it
Dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
I got you scared all you got to do is stay calm
For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this
You see it and you hear it and you loving it
Now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
Aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop
[Chorus]
Drop that [3x]
Let knowledge drop
[Tupac]
People rush when I hype this because you can write this
You constantly bite this
Thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
Caught with the dope dose
Now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
Cause you feeling the full force
Like what you hearing so your checking with the source
Tupac brother with the rhymes to rock on
Dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
I'm not conceited but defeated I won't be
As long as there's dope beats I'll never be lonely stop
And let me breathe a minute
Aiyyo Dizzy what's up put the base back in it
[Chorus]
Let knowledge drop [3x]
[Rock]
By any means neccessary it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
I was waiting for a prayer GOD gave me a goal
I refuse to be busting like a sucker for I'm fighting like a titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I go as far as rock can see
Not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops
[Chorus]
Drop that [3x]
Let knowledge drop
Strictly strictly yea dope [till end]

[Heavy D]
Yea this is uh Super funk you know what I'm sayin
This is for all the players and playetts wherever you at you dig
I'm talkin about from this side to that side
East side, West side, your side, my side
It's all about being funky man
Aiyyo give me that microphone
It's Heavy D the baritone and I'm home alone dig it
and I'm always staying freshly dipped on 1-2-5th
where the dogs bark and the dreadlock be sparkin spliff
Okay okay okay okay it's Heavy D again
Hallelujah I'm on your T.V. screen again
You see me on your MTV and on your BET
and on your local focal point video show
Nigga this how it flow so fly like an eagle
No sequels no weed but I get love from all the thugs
cause they still my people
I'm dynamic punks panic when they see me
They get all shook up when my mic's hooked up
Let's get it on!
[chorus]x2
Untouchables at your door
(Let's get it on)
All you wack rappers hit the floor
[2pac]
How should I plead forever thuggin on a quest to get G's
Runnin from enemies ever since the days of a seed
I'm under pressure the stress will have me drinkin
thinkin niggaz after me much too paranoid to blink
Wonder why the police don't wanna see me stackin G's
They after a playa but I won't let em capture me
I gotta thank the lord for the weed and a nigga team
I can't sleep close my eyes I see wicked deams (deamons)
I keep my pistol by my bedside one in the chamber
Preoccupied with homocide my life's in danger
Rollin down a ?? beware of stangers
Hand on my 4-5 that's what the fame does
I'm probably wrong but I'll never know it till I'm gone
From out the ghetto where the jealous motherfuckers roam
Pass the weed let that Hennessey get to me
before the penitentiary
Let's get it on!!
[chorus]x2
Untouchables at your door
(Let's get it on)
All you wack rappers hit the floor
[Grand Puba]
I thought you knew I stay true to this rhyme thing I do
I have all the honeys saying, ""Go Pu'!""
I flip a style from the projects building 70 apartment 6C
I turn food stamps to green stamps rough power amps
and sold weed under corner lamps but now I'm just microphone talkin
So when you see my ass have my cash or just keep walking
Niggaz got more game than Genesis
Seen a movie in L.A. now everybody wanna C
but them youth don't trouble we
because they fall victim to what they see hey!
I keeps it +Reel to Reel+ like my last album title song
but I understand it takes a year for niggaz to catch on
(hit em in the head dog) So let's get it on! yea
[Notorious B.I.G.]
Split the dutches fill it with the skunk we about to
get wicked in the joint uh Notorious is glorious
*cough, cough)*
Niggaz now who's the mind blower, the weed grower
Have you seeing doubles like Noah, the rhyme flower
B.I.G. top notch with the glock check your pockets
and your sock it's just the way my pops taught me
When you throw the drop check em throughly
The bastard might spin around and try to bury me
And dead niggaz don't make no moves
When I'm slingin in the hood I don't fake no moves aight
Reminiscin on my swingin days
when I drove a Caddy and my bitch sported finger waves
Yea she had the Gucci roots I had Sarducci suits
Oshkosh-begosh Coca-Cola lookin real cute
Junior M.A.F.I.A. representin Bucktown
Mac-11 cocked back niggaz better duck down
Face down you know the routine the cream
Earrings you know the drama Biggie bring
Let's get it on

To my unborn child.. in case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
[talking in background]
To my unborn child..
To my unborn..
[2Pac]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed since I'm born to wild
in case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin
Tryin to earn every penny that I'm gettin, and reminiscin
to the beginnin of my mission
When I was conceived, and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud, single parent but she proud
when she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
To school, but I dropped out, and left the house
Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin, so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again, or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it'll sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child
[Chorus: sung, with 2Pac ad libs]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you, if you didn't know I feel this way
How I, think about you every day
I have so much to say
[2Pac]
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to bein anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be rapist
It's hard to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times but I'm still breathin
Livin proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right, or the wrong way?
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace.. when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy, and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Dear Lord can you hear me, tell me what to say
to my unborn seed in, case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs? Cause bein black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm kiddin? I'ma thug 'til I die, I'ma rider mayne
Touch bases, eat lunch at plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein there
Just know your daddy was a soldier, me against the world
Bless the boys, and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal, restin in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child
[Chorus - repeat to fade]
[2Pac over Chorus]
To my unborn child.. please take of all my kids
My unborn child.. to my unborn child
This letter goes out to.. to the seeds that I might not get to see
cause of this lifestyle
Just know that your daddy loves you, got nuttin but love for you
All I wanted was for you have a better life than I did
That's why I was out here on a twenty-four hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you up there in the ghetto heaven
Cause ghetto heaven gotta be there.. haha, take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know that sometimes it's confusin
The rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day everyday
Watch out for these snakes and fakes, friends comin down the way..

Uhh.. dear Mr. President
Whas happenin?
I'm writin you because, shit is still real fucked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true
[2Pac]
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin what's goin on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these niggaz actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggaz fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
cause I'm seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, nigga what you smokin on?
Figure if we high they can train us
but then America fucked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ?ride for M'Thulu? like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
[E.D.I. Amin]
Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a nigga flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same nigga
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'fuckers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your motherfuckin troops keep killin our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherfucker
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
[Kastro]
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, niggaz lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a nigga you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
Shit is still fucked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
and it ain't gon' get better
[2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up..
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain't never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
[Big Syke]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President
Hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
[2Pac]
Word motherfuckin life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin taxes, takin off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin?
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin ??
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle til we come up
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggaz actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do

to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean shit, I hear you screamin peace
But we can't find peace

I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a nigga out?
Sayin you cuttin welfare
That got us niggaz on the street, thinkin who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
but y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin to lose
Tryin to turn all us young niggaz into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the fuck I'm fightin for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and

Fuck peace

To them tricks and them bitches
Out to get a nigga's riches

[Verse 1: Richie Rich]
Jack of all trades ballin' like Jordan you punk
fake inside the paint in fact I know you can't
do half of the shit that you was claimin' in the county
Suckas on yo jock you claim you run the block
Polyurethane busta cracked in half
you claim you folding bank but I know yo bank stank
I lived around the corner I seen you fully smoked
Must I say some more you weighed a buck 04
you sold ya TV for a buck cause it was way too late
Now they sent you upstate and you done gained some weight
You's a baller lying to them youngstas quick
got them thinking you sick and representing yo click
But you's an old basehead kickin' too much hype
yo bicentennial pipe it got rally stripes
And if they knew yo identity
you'd probably be the victim of a sticking (ugh ugh)
You ain't got to lie to kick it.
[Chorus 4x]
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
You ain't got to lie to kick it

I got these niggas yackin' in my face
about some shit that never took place
And what you see is what you get
that's what he told me
I peeped it in his pose
exposed the fucking phony
I'm gettin' richer so they claim to be my homie
with them bitches they be freaky
they don't know me
Hey it's gettin drastic
Gunnin niggas down cause they plastic
Sleep on a G and get that ass kicked
and stuffed in a casket
Rippin' the shit like it's my muthafucking last hit
Hey they wonder why a nigga's nothin' nice
and everytime I bust a nut I fuck for Tyson
Cause I know the real on the bitch
she got to skit ya just to get a nigga's riches (fuck that bitch)
I pray to God that the bitch don't get no dick
and got a nigga screamin' Fuck That Bitch!

[Verse 3: Pac   Rich]
Well if a bitch'll be a bitch
Then a trick'll be a trick
I've got my nigga Richie Rich and we be all up in the mix
this is Thug Life baby rollin' hoes like Vogues
Stay the fuck up out of mine
and I'll stay out of yours
It's a Oakland thang and bitch you wouldn't understand
This Tanqueray got me screamin' Fuck yo' man.
But now you beefing on the strength
that you was thinkin' I was jocking
Hey bitch I got no time for hoes I'm steady clockin'
and if it ain't about a buck I gives a fuck
it's raggedy hoes like you that keep a nigga stuck
so what's up with them low life bitches tryin' to play me
Bitch you better see Trojan about yo' baby (Ha ha)
Trickin' niggas better catch up on they pimpin'

Land of the Free, and home of the enslaved
Till the concept of time
6 hours, 22 minutes, and 3 seconds, I've been standing in this
county line
By the looks of the Gridlock outside
Its gotta be about 3:39
Everybody rushin from place to place
The looks on their faces ain't no different from mine
Both of us look like we just worked a 9-5
See, but when I clock out
I'm not looking for stress, but for the kind share
Since I started this county line shift,
huh did I say shift? I mean this sentence
I've heard nothing but sirens outside the door
How much you want to bet there's an ambulance rushin a short man,
O.D. man, police abused black man to the hospital?
Now what they rushin for is my intrest?
Rushin through traffic jam to get to emergency room traffic jam, that's
susppose to be a free clinic
Only to hear if you have or don't have insurance
It ain't nuttin but survivial of the fittest
So what they rushin for?
And damn this man at the window is slow
The concept of time has os all fucked, and on top of that,
Life ain't nuttin but a traffic jam.
(2pac)
Life is too short, I feel trapped
Hopping I don't get caught, watch my back
Lost in the traffic, heartless and tragic
Don't wanna get my ass kicked
So I walk in this mindless state, and a don't make me feel this way
I'll tell ya
Life is a traffic jam, I'm stuck
When will you realize your fucked?
Don't try to change my ways, I'm hopeless
Victims to the games we play, stay focused
Watch for the crazy ride, don't lie
High till the day we die
I'ts my life
Tell me if you feel me
I'll tell ya
Life is a traffic jam sincerely
Stretch your mind, spoon feed your soul
3 voices you can't control
Remember life is a traffic jam

It's hard to be a man.
Ridin wit my gun in hand.
Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin.
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat,
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen.
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean.
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space.
Have these bitch niggas snitchin.
Where are we now? Guns found daily.
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope.
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap.
Attack. Words bein known to explode on contact.
Extreme at times. Blinded by my passion and fury.
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin my jewelry.
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me. Truely effective.
The shit you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish, bitch.
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam.
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team.
Ain't nobody holdin you back. Explode the track to confetti.
Unload it. Cuz niggas ain't ready. The life of an outlaw.

Code 3. Attack formation. Pull out your pistols.
Keep an eye out for the devils cuz they itchin to get you.
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue.
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run.
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin.
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream.
Dope got me hatin fiends. Scheam wit my team, just a chosen few.
My foes victim of explosives. Come closer. Exhale the fumes.

Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash.
Don't look now. How you like it, raw.
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws. Never surrender.
Death is for a son to stay free. I'm thugged out.
Fuck the world cuz this is how they made me.
Scarred but still breathin.
Believe in me and you could see the victory.
A warrior with jewels. Can you picture me?
Life of and outlaw.
[Chorus repeats]
City under siege. It's like I can't even breathe.
I'm from the state of car theives. G, deep from the street.
Plenty beef. I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene.
Mobb Deep. This nigga from behind tryin to creep.
No halfs wit no straps, jack.
It's on to bounce back.
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style ?
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha.
Snip wit clippers. Get the picture?
I wrote my life down like a scripture.
And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely.
Where ain't nobody holy. A matter of a fact, we unholy.
Everybody livin soley for themselves. Too ?? on a land hell.
Somebody need me. You know we lost hope and we needin it.
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalouz
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed.
To plan shit. 6 months in advaced to what we plotted.
Approved to go on swole and now I got it.
Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin.
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin.
Creepin deep into morning. Peepin out the weak.
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for it's self.
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind.
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind.
Findin it funny, matter of fact, cuz it is.
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw.
Eh, Noble.
What's up nigga.
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah.
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga.
Ah yo.
What's up.
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now.
Watch out.
Well now they all say they roaches and parasites.
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night.
Drink till we fist fight.
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest.
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath.
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark.
So chase ?
Beware foolin marks.
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for PO's belly.
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweaty.

They got me goin cold-hearted
Probation, violation, incarceration
Frustration, you know
Fuck that, nigga damn near bouts to start basin
It's hard!  Hard on a nigga {*coughing*}
Hard on a nigga (yeah it is, yeah it is)
{*whispered*} Kill kill kill, murder murder murder
Watch out nigga!
Chorus: Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin like a G
(repeat 2X)
[Tupac - chorus 2X throughout]
Daz in this motherfucker
Alright bwoy, drop that shit
Whassup man?  Always listen to that shit?
That thug criminal shit?  Peep game nigga, peep game, feel me
[Verse One]
Travel through my mind am I blind it's a shame
Young niggaz gettin murdered straight took out the game
As I sit here puffin on a cigarette
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin on a niggaz death
These are the rough times, best to hurry up
and duck muh'fucker 'fore I buck mine
It's gettin crazy and everybody's strapped
Surrounded by niggaz but nary a motherfucker down to watch my back
These are the bitch made niggaz, you been played nigga
While you starvin and broke they pullin six figures
Oooh, what can you do
when you can't trust your crew, time to bust out the wenty-two
Boo-yaow!  Ran out of weed, so I'm sippin
on this Hennesey, tell me, do you feel me?
Heyyy, I have no remorse
as I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
Thuggin to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
I'm the first muh'fucker that can outrun a bullet
It's them Thug Life niggaz and we don't like tricks
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin like bitches
Now my riches is gettin hoes on it's own
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone
I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin that spinach
and stayin strong to the finish and then I ride out
See you on the freeway, sorry baby
but I gotta call my homey see what he say
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot everytime
And ain't no way I'ma let bitch made nigga worry me
Catch me slippin, empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah nigga have to plug me twice
Ain't no slippin when you Thug for Life, motherfucker can you see?
[Chorus 2X]
[Verse Three]
Never bow down let these other bitches crawl
I'm a Thug motherfucker and these Thugs only ball
Ain't no half steppin here, from the cradle to the grave
I'm a muhfuckin fool, but I choose to get paid
Now my pockets gettin empty, and I'm panicked in a fright
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin tonight
Ain't nobody livin safe, got a plot, and I'm stressin
All I want, is my muh'fuckin money, ain't no question
Don't try to stall little trick, cause we hit
So bring in the scissors and get to clippin at his dick
I'd rather die young than die old and broke
That's why I stay drunk, and I constantly smoke
My memories as a youngsta, hangin with the homies
But now I'm doin bad and them bitches don't know me (Who? Who?)
But playa haters can't fade me (Why?)
Cause this is Thug Life nigga and we're crazy, tell me do you see?
[Chorus 2X]
[Verse Four]
Yeah, constantly runnin from danger ain't no stranger to cop cars
Gettin arrested and tested wearin a vest and don't drop my guards
My life is hectic my homies send mail from jail
Niggaz in Hell got some horrible stories to tell
I'm catchin cases and still tryin to stack a grip
The IRS is tryin to stress off a niggaz shit
A young nigga never had a prayer to prevail
And all my peers doin years locked up in jail
What can I do, stay strapped, get a bigger crew
And creep around with them Dogg Pound niggaz too
And now we rich ain't no bitch than can touch us
And it's a trip, how we clown, when we fuck sluts
Bust nuts then I cut, that's my new thang
And motherfuckers got on do-rags
[Chorus 2X]
Can I get paid, can I get paid, can I motherfuckin get paid
Nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin day and
still never see a piece of it, you understand me?
It's not about the nice guy
It's bout the hardworkin motherfuckin Thug nigga
If you ain't a Thug nigga, you ain't really doin nothin
(Chorus repeats in background)
You ain't really makin nothin
These motherfuckin po-po's and these pink folks
got it all locked up for us to fail
See how they did O.J., and they doin niggaz like that all day
So if you don't watch your motherfuckin stack
believe me, this could be your last breath...
[Chorus 2X] to fade

these are
my words to my firstborn, nothing left to hear
(Tupac)
Can you picture
young niggas in the a rush to grow
the hard times in the pen
had to crush his throat
probaly never even saw it coming
to busy bullshitting
caught him with his mouth runnin
ain't that a bitch
they got me twisted in this game
the fedz, and the po police pointing pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong
cause I'm thugged out
my homies murdered execution style
runnin in the drug house
what was suppose to be a easy hit
now shit is flipped
cause niggas died over bullshit
It's not my dream
seeing pictures of a broken man
no witnesses
only the question of a smoked man
young addalicent in the prime live the life of crime
but what ain't logical
we hobble through these trying times
living blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
why all my homiez had to die before they got to grow
and right before I put my head on the pillow
I saw a prayer
one love to the thug's in heaven
I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
help me make it threw the storm
the words to my first born feel me
My words to my firstborn
my words to my first born
(Tupac)
Since my very first day on this earth
I was cursed
so I knew the birth of a child would make my life worst
though it hurst me
there was no remorse
cause wild seeds can't grow
watch your soul
cause you know what you had to do
so the victims of the world came to
I understand there is a better day coming
sometimes catching you sleeping on the dead end
driving with the car running blinded
ain't no love in the hood
only hearts torn
love letters to the unsitting unborn
all the babies that died up on the table
wasn't able to breathe
cause the family wasn't able
can't blaim I would do the same
all I could give it was my depth and my last name
cause in the game things change living up and down
this hard life got me walking with my head down
flashing frowns wasn't meant to be
was I wrong
but i'll never get to know
so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
my words to my firstborn, feel me
my words to my first born
my niggas Nutso up in this bitch
these are my words to my firstborn
(Nutso)
I'm just another thug nigga trapped in this ghetto life
an endless hustla
struggling trying to settle right
and doing dirt ain't saving me
but the streets is the only thing paying me, feel me
running with G's
stacking G's
packing E's
mobb life to these mothafuckas wack me
stacking greenary
thugging to I die
picking up so much J
I'm getting high
got the fedz on me
and they label me a bad grip
thinking I'm the reason why this nigga got his head through
on the run
now daddy got to pack a gun
cause these niggas want me to make you the last one
about these riches
these jealous bitches are going to sell through
welcome to life
and if I die
remember that it is all love when I'm by your side
every night
don't be a loser
choose your dreams through your things
cause solo to the ho ho will twitch you up
like shoe strings
open your eyes
don't let these haters get you
roll up and diss you
my words to my firstborn
(Tupac)
words to my mothafuckn seeds, you feel me, nigga doesn't know what's
going to
happen until tomorrow and the next day, your fuckn baby can be gone
tomorrow,
I already seen it happen, mothafucka got two bullets to his head, he
no longer
exists, that's what I'm talking about, what you going to tell your
kids nigga,
who was you, what was you doing, how did you put it down, these are my
words
to my mothafuckn firstborn, see now you know, know what I mean, ain't
nothing
but a mothafuckn rider, westside till I die, that's all it was, these
crooked
ass dealing hand mothafucka, just played to win, mothafucka got a bet
against
the odds, know what I mean, rolling those mothafuckn dice, sometimes
you get 7
or 11, sometimes we crap out, thats a chance a mothafucka takes, cause
these
are my words to my mothafuckn firstborn, me and my nigga Nutso,
represtenting

When you see me comin, BIG SCOOB GOT EM RUNNIN
Sex when I flex I catch wreck on the world tour
with dough in my pockets big like the biscuits, in CB4
Set up a contest, I'm comin, I'm takin the dough
They wouldn't pick you even if you had a afro
So dont try me, you better walk by me
I'll do you like the first part in Menace II Society

We gonna do it like this
Anytime you're ready, check it
I got seven Mack 11's, about eight 38's
Nine 9's, ten mack tens, the shits never ends
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls; the millionare, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
That's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the lamb spread
Little Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give mc's the runs drippin
when I throw my clip in the AK, I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flow's remarkable, peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniffed the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jail cells
Oh my God, I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
[Tupac]	Motherfuckin Biggie Smalls!
[Kane]	What you gonna do with it Tupac?
[Tupac]
Yeah where the motherfuckin thugs at?
Throw your motherfuckin middle finger

I thank the Lord for my many blessings, never stressin
Keep a vest for protection, from the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggaz in the pen, here we go again
Ain't nuttin separatin us from a mack-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, told ya
A straight soldier, buckin at the bustaz
No matter how you try, niggaz never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
You see me strikin down the block, hittin corners
Mobbin like a motherfucker, livin like I - wanna
And ain't no stoppin at the red lights, I'm sideways
Thug Life motherfucker crime, pays!
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me nigga
Zig zaggin through the freeway, race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw
[Kane]	Yeah!  Come in now man
Now I wanna see what my man Shyheim gonna do with it
[Shyheim]
Yo, this goes out to everybody from Staten Island
{*ah Mister Cee, and you don't stop*}
Yo, times is gettin hard, word is bond, I swear to God
I even got caught tryin to steal from the junkyard
A born terror, a rebel without a pause
I never had a good Christmas, so who is Santa Claus?
I walk the streets at night with my head down
In this lil town you see clowns that wanna be down
So they get a glock and lick shots to get props
And when shit rocks all you can hear when the shells drop
An old man got shot in the parkin lot
In front of my buildin I hang with his grandchildren
And for the nigga that pulled the trigga then tried to slide
and hide, but he got knocked by the homicide
And this happens everyday around my way
So I pray that I can live another day
[Kane]	This how we gonna do it, hold up Cee, aiyyo, let's try this
[Shy]	Staten Island in the motherfuckin house
Whassup Wu-Tang Clan in here or what?
[Kane]
Hold up Cee..
Now what's the bullshit niggaz been saying
Dont try to act like Martin now with that ""I was just playin!""
No need to grieve now on, now that the beef is on
Uhh!!  Oh yeah motherfucker, your teeth is gone
Just cause you rap don't meant that you're catchin wreck with me
Step to this I'll give your mic a vasectomy
I only know one nigga that can come next to me
No, that's a tattle, cause I can't count my own shadow
A battle, I gots to have it, 'lest you're gonna rob me
like they did, Whittaker when he fought Chavez
Cause when it comes to goin against Kane rappin
That's like a pimp trying to pull a nun, ain't nuttin happenin
Non resistable, non compatible
I'm not saying I'm the best, I'm just saying I'm fuckin incredible
And let's just get one more thing understood
If I fart on a record, trust me nigga, that shit gon' sound good

Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker

['Pac is choking on blunt smoke]
Lord knows
[coughing harder]
Lord knows
[one final cough]
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
and if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows
[coughing again]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
[still coughing]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
and every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
and still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
it's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard
in the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
and Lord knows...

Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
One-time! One-time!
Fuck the five-oh cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin, fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
and he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin up
I'm gettin lost in the weed, man, gettin high
Livin everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...

We comin after these niggas world wide
Feel me

Born hated as a thug

From a lack of gettin love
Won't nobody tell me shit
Till I got a sac of drugs
At the block sewn up
Cause I wanna pack a gun
Do you feel me?
World do ya hear me?
Catch a risin' star
Fuck the love
Niggas fear me
Got these niggas runnin all wild
From my double R when we ride
Motherfuckers is sure to die
Boom once I enter the room
In the air all you hear
Is the whispers of doom
Niggas scared
They don't wanna see me head on
Think of all the busters
That I had to leave dead and gone
Called a brave nigga
Fuckin with a made nigga
M.O.B. gun fire
Gettin sprayed quicker

Much more than 6 figures

Nigga I was raised on the streets
I had to hustle just to eat
My role model was killin niggas
So I know I would never be weak
They got me sittin wonderin
Where my life begins
These niggas cross my father
Then my father cross them
Cause I role with Immortal Thugs Niggas
And my number one plan
To kill a man and grab a needle
And drug niggas
Niggas don't like us
Because they bitches straight love us
The president told us to leave
Cause the government don't want us
It's Napolean
I get my pleasure out of sin and seeing
Plus billin shit
Cause I seen it at the beginning
A Made Nigga
Khadafi:
How many niggas fall in ya vision
Gunnin em down for every last minute
That I spent in prison
We mash together
Plus we get cash together
Blast whenever
Knowin it don't last forever
It's only one way out
And one way in
Motherfuckers cross
And get crossed out
Never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups
Like rock block raute
I can't be touched
Cause of the weapons I clutch
And them niggas that I'm unda
Is just to much
We Made Niggas

Picture the scenery
So now you gonna have to imagine
Call me a prophet

At those who be paper snatchin
While their mugs got cracked in the 80's
Baby, maybe thats if I slip
But I became official
Since the start of this
Idi Amin born July
7 of fushid eyes
Plus wit all this gave me they hate to cherish
But still I made it
A made nigga made by the game
Made for war
My aim is simple and plain
Yah wether its cane
Or these tracks made for ya brain
You'll forever know my name

Hussein:
I aint killed my line, my strap, my head
There will be none of that

Till we still, and chill
Recognize the real deal
Still a nigga made when I was young
And dumb with a gun but it pays
So I'm bustin for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all going to die
Get yours cause I'm a get mine.

Help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage
I'll display my rage
Surround the court building
With the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'm going, and finally sentenced
On my knees to God
Beggin for repentence
I'm convinced that I'm a thug
They got me feenin for my cash
Like a feen when he dreams of drugs
Get the dollar
And I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral
And tell yah just who gave the order

I maintain my army of lunatics
That stay armed til the day I die
I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw til the grave a motherfuckin made nigga.

[2Pac]
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these narcs
be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocked, G, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
*Chorus*
[Treach]
Without no doubt I ain't no slouch and it ain't time to back down
So I jumps in and try to stop-a and watch-a
Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus ""P"" hangin possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons
*Chorus*
[Riddler]
Now I be loyal to my niggas on the blocks, just buckin the shots
And packin the glocks
and dodgin the cops, and takin over niggas spots
Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin, the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
then through to the Pac I brings the glock I wets up
You fuckin body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low
I lives doin my rap, but I dies for my hood row
So all you fuckin fools better recognize, and know my fuckin name
I be Riddler to my niggas and I'm loyal to the game
[Chorus]

My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggaz swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggaz rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggaz feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga
[Chorus]
{""And come off this trip""}
[DJ Quik]
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like loose rollin, I'm growin until the diesel hit me
I'm badder than bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
when I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not cool
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
from him scrappin when niggaz was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em

[Chorus 2X: 2Pac]
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
and you know we keep it money over bitches
[2Pac]
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggaz in penitentary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggaz with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches
[Chorus w/ ad libs]
[Fatal]
I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin Cristal, start thinkin 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody
[Chorus]
[Mopreme]
My shit's phenomenal, droppin like domino
Comin with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggaz nationwide doin work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
(Nigga!)
[Chorus]
[Big Syke]
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches
[Chorus]
[E.D.I.]
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin my own that's tokin chokin off-a glocks smokin
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
Gettin niggaz fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin a watch out for cops
Gettin kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my bitches
[Chorus - 2X]
[2Pac]
That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin bitches
M.O.B. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin bitches
You need some motherfuckin money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here

No man seperate what we create
Unstoppable, untouchable, motherfuckin worldwide mob figures
Death Row at it's finest!
M.O.B., thug for motherfuckin lifeMotherfuckin made niggaz
We comin after these niggaz, worldwide
Feel me! Makaveli the Don
My life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug
House full of babies cryin from a lack of gettin love
Ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs
Had the block sewn up, cause I learned to pack a gun, do you feel me?
World do ya hear me? Catch a risin star
Fuck the love, niggaz fear me
Got these niggaz runnin all wild from my double-I
When we ride motherfuckers is sho' to die
Boom once I enter the room, in the air
all you hear is the whispers of doom, niggaz scared
They don't wanna see me head on..
Think of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone
Call a gravedigga, fuckin with a made nigga, M.O.B.
Gunfire gettin sprayed quicker..
Fuck 'em all let em understand my plot to get richer
Much more than six figures, a motherfuckin made nigga
(Can you feel me?)
A motherfuckin made nigga..
I got a plot to get richer, take my picture
A made nigga
[Napolean]
Nigga I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat
My role model was killin niggaz so I know, I would never be weak
They got me sittin wonderin, where my life begins
These niggaz crossed my father den my father crossed them
Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggaz
And my number one plan to kill a man to grab a needle and drug niggaz
Niggaz don't like us because they bitches straight love us
The President told us to leave, cause the government don't want us
It's Napolean, I get my pleasure out of sin
and seein blood spill ain't shit cause I seen it at the beginnin
A made nigga
[Fatal Hussein]
How many niggaz fall in ya vision?
Gunnin 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison
We mash together, plus we get cash together
Blast whenever knowin it don't last forever
It's only one way out and one way in
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups like (?)Rachmel Raouf(?)
I can't be touched cause of the weapons I clutch
And the niggaz that I'm under, is just too much
We made niggaz
[E.D.I.]
Picture the scenery cause for now you gon' have to imagine
Call me a prophet cause I predicted what's gon' happen
I began the paper, stackin at those
who be paper snatchin, will emerge like crack in the 80's
Baby, maybe, that's if I slip
But I became official since the start of this, Edi Amin
Born July, 7th a few shed eyes
Precious but others gave me they hate, to cherish
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain
Yeah whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain
You'll forever know my name, Edi Amin
[Kastro]
I ain't count the line, my strap, not head,
there will be none of that
The young hog, K-Dog playin Outlaw Immortal combat
With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga
Til he still and chill, recognize the real dea
lFeel - a nigga made when I was young and dumb
with a gun but it pays so I'm bustin for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all gon' die, get yours cause I'ma get mine
[Khadafi]
Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public
With my mentality of war, dead bodies and silence give it to ya raw
Thug nigga to the core
The results of livin poor, got me thinkin on a made level
Shootin my gauge to get paid, a fuckin crazed devil
Mash shit from here to there day by day, year to year
Made niggaz on ya motherfuckin tear, I'm a made nigga
[2Pac]
Ha ha ha.. call me a Bad Boy killer murder motherfuckers daily
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli
Gettin lessons from niggaz in penitentiaries
Game, when applied help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage I'll display my rage
Surround the court buildin with the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced
On my knees to God, beggin for repentence
I'm convinced, that I'm a thug
They got me fiendin for my cash like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
Diss Kidada and I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral and tell you just who gave the order
Makaveli the Don, til I'm gone, I maintain
my army of lunatics that stay armed
Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin made nigga
[2Pac]
Can you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha
Get into the mind of a made niggaI can't be touched
My adversaries, get fucked, feel me?
Multimillionaire dreams, all I want is the C.R.E.A.M.
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream
Come and see, to see a made nigga
The Outlawz.. Makaveli The Don
Hussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro, Napolean, Khadafi..
Mussolini, M.O.B. I send this out to my niggaz on the streets
The motherfuckin made Niggaz
All my niggas on Death Row, Tha Dogg Pound
Tha Doggfather, and all his niggaz
You know what time it is, Daz Dillinger

That's right
I feel ya (hey)
I know how it is
(MAMA's JUST A LIL' GIRL)
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya
[Verse 1: Tupac]
She was ..
Born A heavy set girl with pig tails and curls
A heart full of gold
Still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die
Was only 15
Should have been a beauty queen
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed
Little girl don't cry
'Coz even though they died
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery
But look at what you gettin'
It's a blessing in disguise
When you find out your pregnant
No money, no home
And even though you all alone
You'se got to do this on your own
So baby go on
I wish you luck
And if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand
The way it feels when you fighting the world
Facing all this drama
When mama's just A little girl
[Chorus]
Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she's a ??
Time ain't on her side
Mama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high
[Verse 2: Tupac]
At 16 what a beautiful thing
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age
She didn't listen, had sex
Watch her belly raise (hey)
Got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind
She reclines 9 months
Then finally its time
What do we find?
A little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul
Addicted to a life of crime at no time of the growing stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police
Don't come home (why)
'Coz mammas acting crazy
At the hospital
'Bout to have another baby
Like the rose from concrete
Grown within
Blessed with twins
How the hell can mamma raise 3 men
So we began a closest family
Such insanity
A happy home
For one act inhumanity
Plus mammas said the seed was corrupted
Used the rubber belly
Begging us to breathe if she love us
Now mamma sits quiet
Sipping peppermint schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)
How could mamma bring a thug like me into this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama
Cause mommas just a little girl
[Chorus]
Mama
Don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Liven if she is or not
Time ain't on her side
Cause ama's just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
She gotta hold her head up high
(How could she raise us)
[Verse 3: Tupac]
Now
Would she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot
Now look here
I see her clutching her son
In her arms she hurt
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfill prophecy
But who could stop the grief?
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top me
Probably be an innocent man
But still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse?
Nothing but pain
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen
Cause everybody's in paying back society
I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watched the drama occur
My eyes blurred 'fore I jet it
I wonder why we all have to die for we get it
Though we shed tears
So many peers I done buried
Worried and scared
Knowing I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared in this cold world
No-one cares
No it ain't fair
But we all there
And do our share
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand
Mamma told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talking about coward
What you niggas want?
(hey)
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha
You' just a little girl
See mammas just a little girl
(hey hey)
[Chorus]
[Repeat until fade]
Mama
don't know why
Mama's just a little girl
Given that she is or not
time ain't on here side
mama's just a little girl
(mama's just a little girl)
she gotta hold her head up high
[Tupac Talking]
They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
Facing all this drama
But to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which we came
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
On the contrary
We would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well
We are the roses (echo)
This is the concrete (echo)
And these are my damaged petals (echo)
Don't ask me why (echo)
Thank god nigga (echo)
Ask me how (echo)
(hahaha)
You see, mama's just a little girl

I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
[girl]
Oh-hahhh
[2Pac]
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby

Me against the world

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Everday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
when I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
[girl]
Me against the world

With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world

[2Pac]
With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Me against the world, hoahhh
[2Pac]
Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy!
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finaly get to rest? Through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world
[girl]
Me against the world
[2Pac]
Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Me against the world
[2Pac]
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
[girl]
Oahahhhh
[2Pac]
I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Me against the world
[Outro: 2Pac]
Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it
[girl]
Me against the world [3X]

Sheeit, ju motherfuckin right
I'm the bitch that's keepin it live and keepin it hot
when you punk ass niggaz don't
Nigga Westside, WHAT! Bring it on
[Tupac]
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
exorcisin all demons
Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
to bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me
Make the frontpage primetime live on TV
Nigga my girlfriend, baby forty-five but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop
[girl]
What!! I'm bustin on you punk ass niggaz *automatic gunfire*
Run nigga run! *gunfire* I'm on yo' ass nigga! *gunfire continues*
Run nigga, duck and hide! Nigga I'm bustin all you bitches!
Run nigga, yeah! Westside! Uh uh uh! Die nigga die!
[Tupac]
My girlfriend, blacker than the darkest night
When niggaz act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend, though we seperated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine, started out my life of crime
wit you, bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
It's true, nothin compares to the satisfaction
that I feel when we out mashin, me and my girlfriend
[Chorus: Tupac]
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend
[repeat 2X]
[Tupac]
I was too immature
to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drop of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes -- now it's time for war
Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang wit the fellas, I wait patiently alone
anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend
[Chorus]
[Tupac]
I love finger fuckin you, all of a sudden I'm hearin thunder
When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
the only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home, me and my girlfriend
[Chorus 3X]
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind -- look for me
[repeat 3X]
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde

Calvary
[Verse 1: Tupac]
Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme [echo]
Introduce a drug called crack
To us ghetto teens [echo]
Got a law for raw niggas now
Playa what it be like? [echo]
When will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes [echo]
Can't seem to focus
Hopeless
With violent thoughts
I wrote this
Got these devils petrified
Hiding from my hocus pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency
And over time [echo]
Affiliated
Clearly click a military mind [echo]
May god forgive us
Though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealing
>From the womb to the block [echo]
My live mind got me surviving 5 shots [echo]
My 45 got me fortified with live rounds
When shit stick
We plot hits
When our block spits
All hail
Out on bail
Wrath of 2pacalypse [echo]
Forever ghetto
Necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw thug niggas
Never left the boot camp
[Verse 2: BuckShot & Cocoa Brovas]
I'm a nigga for assignment
One of the suqads finest [echo]
Skilled in gorilla warfare
And blessed
Work with firearm [echo]
My rap shit
Contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black smith and wessons [echo]
Putting up on ?? in the military state of mind [echo]
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovas pan the borderline [echo]
That's the sound and your dead son
Man to man
I'm facing the devil with a plan [echo]
Judo stance
First glance
I'm making my advance [echo]
Animal instincts
Intelligence of an assassin [echo]
Mask my ninja style
Surround me ready to attack [echo]
I react swiftly
What father taught me sticks with me [echo]
Never forget the methods stick and move strictly [echo]
Shit be seeming like its closing in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I circles
I'm one of the chosen men [echo]
Picture being put in position to move [echo]
And you can't move
Cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock
That's when the madness beings [echo]
So I start to focusing
My thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law [echo]
And the law that we live by is to stay true to self
In this case beady eye [echo]
Why try
Everybody lie
About the block
True soldier mentality
This is how we rock and move [echo]
Stick and move
Time to show what kinda nigga
Move or get moved on
Lets see whos strong [echo]
In the days of the strange
Where nothing stays the same
With new faces come through with similar game [echo]
And who you thought them
Really ain't they (echo)
Catching deja vu
Of the game people play [echo]
It's a call for re-adjustment
Fine tune your positions
You slipping and tripping
Instead of bobbing and dipping [echo]
Will never let this world of stress get me [echo]
Taking breathing techniques
Slay you with tai chi [echo]
What did you change
To get a break
In the world of snakes
And those who fake
Elimination I'm facing
Destruction
Outlaw till I duck down [echo]
From po po's bustin'
No one to trust in
Rushing to the goal line
Catch a nigga
Beat him
Treat him like he stole mine [echo]
No swine
I'm a soldier
Told cha I control mine [echo]
Time to take you back into time
Follow this here
One way out
This black hole
For this black soul
Shit is outta control
I'm fighting for my position
To be a fetus in this world I am entering [echo]
And my face is sentencing for repentance [echo]
Before my body was fully formed into a human [echo]
I was already consuming weed
Cause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's [echo]
Maybe that's why in the 90's
I drop g's when I drop degrees [echo]
When I ease across the block
With Pac [echo]
And got all you niggas shot
You didn't think
Boot Camp click would link
With the outlaw minded
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep gorilla tactics in every line
[Tupac]
Yeah
And this is how we do it
Where my real thugs?
Where they at?
Let me see my real thugs
Where you at
Wont you see my real thugs

I know this girl and her name is Minnie
Livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
Met her at a school dance so I took a chance
Walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance
Got to my car, put the key in the ignition
turned on the slow jams, I was on a mission
I was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
I was ""J"" and knockin' boots right down the socks
She was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?
But when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet
I couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?
But that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!
(2Pac)
Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from
A dream girl to many brothers, but true to none
Her reputation was enormous - a real go getter
And once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her
Maybe it was her smile, her personality or
the way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
But whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert
Real heart-breaker, but never get hurt
She had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond
helpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'
Met with Politicians, peace to many others
Suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers
She took the power that they possessed
And Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
Minnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
But he wanted payment for the things he did for her
He grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
Minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand
She was a legend to everyone who knew her
That's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher
(Ray Tyson)
Minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler
Addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basshead, crack smoker
He took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown
He bought some bass, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds
She was an addict, tired of the static and poverty
Sick of the same ghetto misery
See, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
Smokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement
Then one day their relationship stopped
when Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops
Minnie was hurt, lost without a clue
To her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new
So she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems
She cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams
(Ray Tyson)
She had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that this girl was much needin'
A plush house made of gold and steel
A diamond car with a platt in the wheel
Now you might think this is a lot of stuff
But to Minnie this was not enough
He bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses
His meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a fortune in nickels and dimes
And she sat around and counted it a billion times
She had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'
Had every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN'!!
She would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
Then she dissin', with zero reply

Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
And the system's sucidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block
And I can't help but wonder whhhy, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus... on my block
And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break nine
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... from my block

I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me, I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Huh - reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter, cause I want you that much
The situation is a no-win, cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, of fallin for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
Its like a trap that I'm sinkin into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin cause I'm thinkin of you
Then we make eye contact, and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel posessed by you
I have these thoughts at night, of undressin you
Its kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't, so he keeps on trustin me
Leaves me alone wit you, while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me, with this temptation?
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin - you're sayin to come over
What do I do?  Go or stay and play it smart
Its gettin rougher cause I suffer from a burnin heart..
My burnin heart..
[Verse 2]
Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel, and now ya wanna leave me lonely
What did I do?  Baby did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken, and now ya make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love, and now we are departed
Girl, I'll buy ya anything ya heart desires
I have to let ya know, baby you're my fire
Warm and wet, each kiss is prolonged
It's your sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just bein with you, and seein the two of us
walkin along the beach, cause girl you are my peach
So sweet and tender, my love I surrender
No need to pretend, that you'll want it to end
I'll never let you go, you're forever my girl
Ya know why?  Cause girl, you are my world
My burnin' heart..
[Verse 3]
Totally tounge tied, every three seconds I keep watchin you
He's my best friend, but I can't help clockin you
How could this be?  How could we both love you
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reinforce the bond that's already there
So many times I find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction casue I fiend for your desperately
I stand here fantasizin, because you're next to me
What can I do, with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal, so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind, and so I'm feelin nervous
I wana tell you how I feel, but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though, it drives me crazy, to see you sittin with him
A tear rolls down my cheek, because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're sayin before they can be said
Hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brother, for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl - my burnin heart, heart, heart..
[Verse 4]
My heart is burnin, ya know it's yearin, for ya sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy, as you kiss and rub my chest
You know ya love me, why must you deny yourself
what I can offer you, yet you want somebody else?
It's not that - well then girl, what could it be?
I hope I'm good for you, cause baby you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream of that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out, it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire - my burnin heart..
[Verse 5]
I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me, I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Huh - reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter, cause I want you that much
The situation is a no-win, cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, of fallin for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
Its like a trap that I'm sinkin into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin cause I'm thinkin of you
Then we make eye contact, and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel posessed by you
I have these thoughts at night, of undressin you
Its kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't, so he keeps on trustin me
Leaves me alone wit you, while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me, with this temptation?
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin - you're sayin to come over
What do I do?  Go or stay and play it smart
Its gettin rougher cause I suffer from a burnin heart..
My burnin heart..
My burnin heart.. my burnin heart.. my burnin heart..

To my dog named Musolini, Big Syke, Thug Life baby
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Hahaha!
[2Pac]
Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin from the future, escapin in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz
[Chorus: sung]
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin out for all mine
[2Pac]
Haha.. bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M.O.B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer, ain't tryin to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M.O.B., 'til I die, when we ride niggaz disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
for leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin sign
Two hired guns bustin everyone, yellin everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
bleedin like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin
See me in physical form, my niggaz swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin jealous niggaz 'til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
and send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggaz, observe and shake niggaz
The only way to see six figures, is break niggaz
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..
Set to explode, my M.O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz

(* Bad motherfucker and you know this  - cut and scratched*)
Stricly Dope in the house
[Tupac Shakur]
Fumble suckers tumble, god damn I'm good
Since I was born I was strong, always knew that I could
Don't care anywhere any place I'll rock
Give me a mic to light and competition will drop
Fast or slow, I'll go and no one is gonna stop me yo
You must be kiddin', you swear you're gonna drop me no
Well sure as battlin' is bad for your health
Know you're confident my friend but don't fool yourself
My mic's a weapon, I'm steppin' with a capable rhyme
Yo, your time for playin' is over you got your crew I got mine
Not braggin', I'm bad and I could only get better
Your girl came on to me she wanted me I wouldn't let her
Don't make sense to come against me and my man  D
How it is, how it was, that's the way it'll be
But you still think you can beat me, huh, get it together
Cause I'll never be beat, never be beat, NEVER!!
(* Bad motherfucker and you know this  - cut and scratched*)
Stricly Dope in the house
(Ray Tyson)
Boldy, you step into the trap of the beast
Cause I'm the predator competitor and risin' like yeast
I'm the microphone musician musically I'm the most
When I rumble you tumble like a burnt piece of toast
Proceed with caution I cannot be stopped
A deadly weapon that is kept inside a sentry lock
Strong hold holdin' on but there's no holds barred
Fuck around and feel the wrath and you're forever scarred
Anybody want to battle just step the hell up
I'll toss your ass like a salad and eat you all up
You climb the rope of success but you know you can't win
You get discouraged because I hold the other end
If I let go, like all the others you will fall
The vicious vocalist consoloist will still be raw
[Tupac Shakur]
You go in battles like a sucker but you'll never recoup
But I'm the veteran the veteran goin' like a troop
Try to stop me you can't, you puff and you pant
Try to beat me at this game, but get stomped like an ant
In the long run I'm the one that's holdin' the mic
Upset to get to me sweatin' me for the rhymes that I write
This time we're goin' at it, silly sucker, get ready
Cause I'm your worst nightmare, FUCK FREDDY!!
Where's that motherfucker that said that I was a dope
Tyin' my rhymes like a rope I'll pull it tight and you'll choke
You swear that you could beat me punk get it together
Cause I'll never be beat ya punk, NEVER!!
(* Bad motherfucker and you know this  - cut and scratched*)
(Ray Tyson)
Hard is what you wanted, now that's what you're gettin'
I'm movin' and groovin' and proven and you're still sittin'
Got me blowin' up like a Hawalian volcano
Runnin' things like drano, lettin' you know that there ain't no
Body gonna diss me now I'm comin' exact
I'm paid I got it made, now that I'm makin' tracks
This is a lesson, at bein' dope that is
Cordless mics is mine, the wheels are his
Tons and tons of freaks I'm a Mac Daddio
Writin' def jams while I'm chillin' on my patio
You are useless as a toothless piranha
I'm ruthless now I'm gonna
bust it and discuss it make it funky to hear
Paragraph to the people penetratin' your ear
You wanna taste of it, ooh here take a full dose
Burn you up like radiation if you get too close
[Tupac Shakur]
Cause my mouth is like an uzi when it moves so quick
And the lyrics are the bullets that I'm loadin' it with
You wanna beat me homeboy, you will be destroyed
Get dropped like a habit and played like a toy
Never defeated not conceited, but let's face facts
Couldn't beat me with a motherfuckin' baseball bat
If I gave you a bomb that was nuclear armed
You could shoot it at me sucker and I wouldn't get harmed
Cause punk you can't stop me, bullets couldn't drop me
Stand on a mountain and still couldn't top me, huh
You think you'll beat me boy get it together
Cause I'll never be beat ya punk NEVER!!
(* Bad motherfucker and you know this  - cut and scratched*)
(Ray Tyson)
When you hear my beat thumpin' it's a maxium charge
Cause I'm the hip-hop hood, the record leader at large
Got a PHD in hip-hop history
A deadly boy not a toy but a poetry, PRODIGY!!
Young beat conisseur hummin' like a bird
It was true when you heard I'm the wiz a word
Your eyes dilate, your ears drums expand
When my voice comes through the speaker from the mic in my hand
Woofers stompin' like thunder all about to explode
The needle on the nuance stuck in overload
Don't laugh cause I'm serious mister mysterious
Don't make me mad (why) Cause I get furious
Countless time after time just when you think I'm through
I let my melody stretch to make more for you
Just bust it cause I'm just too clever
and I'll never be beat ya punk, NEVER!!
[Tupac Shakur]
Rhyme-fumble suckers tumble, god damn I'm good
Since I was born I was strong, always knew that I could
Don't care anywhere any place I'll rock
Give me a mic to light and competition will drop
Fast or slow, I'll go and no one is gonna stop me yo
You must be kiddin', you swear you're gonna drop me no

Whassup Boo? Swear I'll never call you bitch again
You ain't fuck with me, hehehe
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin apologized)
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)
I'll never call you bitch again
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Damn - gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin bout this shit, we been through
We close like kin but you remain my friend to
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin needin tissues, fightin over childish issues
Swear I can't live witchu but withouchu every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin witchu
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free
I see yesterday I called you names, and played games on yo' mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)
[Chorus: Tyrese + (2Pac)]
We came.. too far..
to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. way too far pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, heyyy)
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I wake up early in the mornin, at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin, and now I'm gone
Tryin to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin with the East coast, with casualites
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me
[Chorus]
['Pac speaks over Chorus]
I know, I know
All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
to grow up y'knahmsayin? That was way back then
[Tyrese]
You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you, a bitch again
Yea yea yea
Ohhhhhhhhhh
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feelin pain, things are not the same
""Waitin to Exhale"" while I'm sittin in the county jail
Keep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin in the living room, in the nude
Thanks for bein there, much more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last muthafucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fall
Collect calls to my dogs from the County Jail
Sendin me mail
Heard the blocks in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed
Niggaz slangin at the same place
The same faces
We suppose to always hate are foes
This life style is forever
Watch the game unfold

Just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong
We'll appeal
Nigga you'll be free
Down with cha to the very end
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

How can I be blamed
forgive me Lord I'm insane
In search of fame
Won't hurt to change
Follow in the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with ski masks
No witnesses, as we blast fearless
Reckon now they feel us
more casualties
no survivors
Any man that defies us
Quickly dies
Cuz we ridahs
In my quest for chips
We wear vest
Equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin
Cuz niggaz died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet
So lets make Clinton pay
(ha ha)
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we posses
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smokin weed
Bumpin this beat
Makin a livin out my misery
Till he got a friend like me
(Chorus 2x)
Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Recieving mail to the county jail
This is heel
when I was young, I could picture livin
In Luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die
Nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
so now I sacrifice your life
Help to seperate me from my dog
Broken ties
Why the fuck should I let you live
When I'm dead inside
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin at their whole crew
Nigga remember me
Hit up my Outlaw set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin
It's visitin day at San Quinton
Always there to see your closes row dog
Cuz you ain't never had a friend like me
(Chorus 4x)
Come after us best be complete
My enemies your enemies
Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be

Comin fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Aint nothin' hard about it why you lookin sad? Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin to dick me

Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggaz at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin there sweaty and wet
Pointin to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops

Livin life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!

Haha.. started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin for creamin - bitches with big butts

Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good

You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly

The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen
the poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom
praying for money we never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
at 13 can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me
wish he would've helped me
too much like him 'til my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age gettin' paid
and I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets
running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me?
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose
everybody gotta die
say good-bye to the bad guy
that one you fucked when you passed by
Buck buck [gunshots] from a Glock
tempured glass fly
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
[Chorus]
I got nothing to lose
(that's why I got gang related)
got nothing to lose [5x]
nothing to lose
[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection
from the barrel of the Smith   Wesson
and all my niggas in the pen'
here we go again
Ain't nothing seperating us from a mack 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustla older
straight soldier bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply
see me striking down the block hittin' co'ners
Mobbin' like a muthafucka livin' like I wanna
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
chase me nigga
zig-zaggin' through the freeway
race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
the realest muthafucka that you ever saw
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die
And you could walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm startin' to lose hope
it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo
peepin' out the window alone on my own
I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household I'm out cold
in the streets give me muthafucking peace
I got nothing to lose
and something to prove
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true
I wonder when they kill me
is there a Heaven for a real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke
with no hope li'l skinny muthafucka wantin' dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city
no pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
[Chorus]
[Outro]
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest...Muthafucka!
You know!
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest!

All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
yaknowhatI'msayin? Nuttin but love for the old school
That's who we gonna do this one for, ya feel me?
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today

I remember Mr. Magic, FLASH, Grandmaster Caz
LL raisin hell but, that didn't last
Eric B.   Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
and Red Alert was puttin in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill gettin ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal, remember Raw, with Daddy Kane
when De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggi don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember ""Push It"" was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today

Heheh... I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playin skelly, ring to leavey, or catch a kiss
before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch, I remember
way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin
with some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin
cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, ""Why them niggaz swearin?""
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
or takin leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
if the old school didn't pave the way"" -- [Grand Puba]
Heheheyah, that's right, it ain't nuttin like the old school

Hahah... remember poppin and lockin to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Hoe back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La-Di-Da-Di
Gamin the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties, I remem-ber
breakdancin to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, about to hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nuttin like the old school!
[Grand Puba sample repeats every bar to end]
It ain't nuttin like the old school
Hahahah, it ain't nuttin like the old school
Hey, heheaha, on the real though, ain't nuttin like the old school
...
Remember seein Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfuckin party?
Member how fuckers used to go, ""Is Brooklyn in the house?""
and motherfuckers would lose they GOD DAMN MIND
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin (Su-per, Sperm)
I remember goin places that motherfuckers was scared to say
they was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfuckin old school nigga
Remember skelly nigga? Knockin niggaz out the box, poppin boxes?
Member stickball? Member niggaz to run that shit like that?
Member the block members screamin up at your mom from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as HELL...)
The ice cream truck, member all the mother...

Yo remember the italian icey's the spanish niggaz comin down

I came through the door, said it before
That was the SHIT!

[2pac]
Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe,
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
[Eminem]
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we aint
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
Thats why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing....
[2pac]
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of him die, but makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
Thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I cant win so I'm inviting some help
and every now and then I take rights from left
Im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game aint changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
and we continue growin...
[2Pac]
...One day at a time. Damn!

Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
but he ignores me unfortunately cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me
My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin, two to the head
while I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious
of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her
like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
by me like they know me, smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm Thuggin, and every day
I'm a hustler lookin to get paid
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
See motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me
""Only fear of death..""
""You ghetto niggaz""
""Only fear of death is comin back reincarnated""
[repeats continously w/ variations]
Hahaha, I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
To my homies in heaven
I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
Or will you scream, when you fry?
I don't fear death
My only fear of death is comin back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P.
And Big Kill, R.I.P.
And all you other O.G.'s, who go down
I don't fear death

Only God can judge me, is that right

Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
Verse One: 2Pac
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me

Verse Two: 2Pac
I hear the doctor standing over me *heart monitor: beeping slowly*
screamin I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me *beeping sound stops*
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies
I wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that it's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me

For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz,  You can fade him,  punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay

Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire

In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
at the coppers that persue me, beotch!

Open fire on you bustas
""Alright now, here we go""

Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

y'all ain't never gonna see me in this motherfucker again
drop that shit em!
let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone thats my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail
Out on Bail (You know what fuckin' time it is)
ThugLife will never fail (I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm going straight to 50,000 biatch!!!)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 40's from the fridge nigga)
ThugLife will never fail (Cause I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex)
Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a Presidential)
Stuck in jail, I'm mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild thru the streets like i'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause i'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen i was at it (hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and i gotta lotta love
Hangin out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her cause i just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
cause I know that I won't be away long
and when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail
Out on Bail
ThugLife (see) will never fail (Out on bail - biatch!)
Thuglife niggaz (You know what time it is)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Y'all don't need to know about...)
ThugLife will never fail (You know, Out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Y'all Blow that shit - Get me up out this)
Thuglife niggaz (Yo, EM!!! Get me up out of this motherfucker man!)
Out on Bail (These motherfuckers are harrasing me and that ain't cool)
^ something not quite right here either
(chorus continues)
(???)
I'm out on bail
I'll see ya motherfuckers at the next show, and by the way, where is my bitch?
It's that famous shit, you know?
Real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine, you know what I'm sayin'
I wouldn't waste your motherfuckin' time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, It's that real shit
I'm talkin' about that shit you never tell your grandkids about, you know?

That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
[RahRah] Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin Outlaw
[Tupac] That's right nigga, hahaha.. housin these hoes, you feel me?
[RahRah] Aight, knowhatI'msayin?
[Tupac] You got to do that shit, keepin it real nigga or what?
[RahRah] Keepin it real!
[Tupac] How old are you nigga?
[RahRah] I'm eleven
[Tupac]
Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
preoccupied with homicide, tryin to survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require may be closed casket
Who can you blame? It's insane what we dare do
Witness an evil that these men do, bitches in, too
In fact they be the reasons niggaz get to bleedin
Pull the fuckin fire when I leave em, you shoulda seen em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
and snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a
[Chorus]
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)
[Tupac]
Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin well
when I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin pictures of these bastards
Excersisin, visualizin, everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggaz in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? Aand if we fail?
High speeds, and thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drivebys and niggaz die, murder without a motive
by making motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryin to hover over niggaz til we drop
Got no time for the courts, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a lie
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I comense to get wicked, spittin rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a
[Chorus]
[Dramacydal]
Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggaz lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggaz bodies put to rest
So I just.. swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck em!""
And if I'm next.. just let a nigga step with somethin
I ain't fearin nuttin
Young and thuggin, prepared for bustin if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggaz can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin
(now he mad) Top speed (smokin weed) blasted (biotch!)
Cause when I bust em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin in the river, what is they sayin?
Talkin bout prayin -- they need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggaz sprayin up my block, tryin to take my wealth
[Chorus 2X]
[Tupac]
Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggaz run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin but muuuuzik
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
but all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real deal
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin bastards
I never die, thug niggaz multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs
Then the youngest thug of all my nigga RahRah

Uh oh, uh oh
Oh, oh
They ain't ready for this
Uh huh
LT Hutton, Snoog Dogg, T.I.
It's that new Pac yall
Uh oh, let's get it, Oh!
[Chorus: Chris Starr (Snoop Dogg)]
Pac's Life (Yeah, uh huh)
Everybody talk about Pac's Life (And you ain't even know the homie)
But what do you know about Pac's Life? (What you know about Pac's Life?) Yeah
Everybody talk about Pac's Life (Outlaw, Outlaw, yeah)
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Started with five shots, niggaz plottin' to kill em'
Never figured that, that same nigga'd sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin cop cars look at how we come so far
Picture high school dropout rollin' the double R
House full of happiness weed and drink
Way out sortin' trouble tryna find me king
Never pictured livin' longer than my twenty-first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out or in the dirt
And though it hurt's to see the change
It comes with the fame
Why we gossip in the silly games
To all the motherfuckers speakin down on me -
This is the night, Why is everybody caught up in Pac's Life
To all ya'll niggaz, conversatin' on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' business!
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
When we first hung out together, I met you with the homie
We had no intentions of becoming homies
But at no time at all, you became my dog
You showed me how to roll blunts, we used to bounce and ball
I was living on Bush in the pent house suites
Had my lil' cousin Daz hook you up with some beats
It was Outlaw, Dogg Pound, Death Row Records, man we tore up the town
Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre and now we got Pac, it felt like a drizzeam
Remember when I told Suge to put you on the tizzeam
And you know that I was true
Cause I took the focus off of me to put 'All Eyez On you'
And we became the most hunted together, '2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted'
And our relationship was genuwine
Wanna know how I know about Pac's Life? Cause was a friend of mine
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ey, what's happenin Pac' yeah I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got the speed
You taught me first -- fate nigga can't stop a G
And all that shit you went through meant alot to me
Watchin you lockin up with him, was a shame to see
You know crack in the business did the same thing to me
I get along with real niggaz, it's a lane to be
Talkin' loud outta pocket tryna bang wit' me
Well so I'm pullin' out my pocket, let it rain ya' see
Now they all in the court room, blamin' me
See we lived the same life and represent the same struggle
Power to the real nigga and death to the sucker
Money over bitches get to know em' before you love em'
Death before dishonor never talk to army trouble
Live by the same rules, so my wrist's tattooed
With the same sorta' dude, with the same short fuse

I couldn't help but notice your pain
[My pain?]
It runs deep
Share it with me!
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
i was a fool all through high school  kickin' up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker  who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rollin' down the freeway swervin, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family, what else could I do
but be a thug
out slangin' with the homies
fuck hangin' with them phonies in the club
got my mind on danger
never been a stranger to homicide
my cities full of gang bangers and drive bys
why do we die at an early age
he was so young
but still a victim of the 12 gauge
my memories of a corpse
mind full of sick thoughts
and I ain't goin back to court
so fuck what you thought I'm drinkin' hennessey
runnin from my enemies will I live to be 23
there's so much pain
(Chorus)
Ohhhh....
Tired of the Strain and the Pain
Ohhhh....
Tired of the Strain and the Pain
years and years of that rough life
runnin crazed and wild as a kid and growin tough with a knife
and livin trifed on the regular
bokin out competitors
see them take a move and take them down like a fuckin predator
get in trouble everyday in school
act a fool
and you know I had to break every rule
showin off for the bitches cause I had the mad rep
so I had to watch my back when it was time to step
[????] with love for me
pop, pop, pop
and send a chuckle up above for me
Aiyyo currency kept passing me by, but I didn't cry
broke and head off with the pack and started sellin coke
And now the money's looking lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game
it's all the same
i kick it back yo
Give 'em slack yo
and now they label me the mack yo
people check it
get disrespected if you front the the birdman
you heard man
catch a couple shots from the glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
you know you get your ass twisted so run for cover
me and my man got a plan kickin' major dust
so if your on nigga look for the gauge to bust
a lot of pressure with the street fame
it's a deep game
and my mama always cryin'
yo there's so much pain
(Chorus)
Ohhhh...
Ohhhh...
They got me mobbin like I'm
loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
i load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
i ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - blaaastin
I'm a nuttin drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
what can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
these sorry bastards
want to kill me in my sleep but will they can I see
and everyday it just a struggle
steady thuggin' in the streets
and i'll be ballin' loc
don't let 'em make you worry
keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
i was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta,
with a mother on drugs
I'm kickin dust up
ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean

As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation indispute nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my answer shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power
[Chorus]
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
[Tyson]
Coming straight that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor can't last
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
""Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star""
Panther power
[Chorus]
Panther power

My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community think of unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet

Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
for you to be comin home talkin that ""daddy's home"" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you

So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. fuck you!

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity

It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry
for all this time (I'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!
[Wycked]
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles
Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!
[2Pac]
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""wanna be your father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry..
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry (so sorry)
for all this time (so, so sorry)
for all this time (I'm so so sorry)
for all this time (fuck that!)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (no)
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!
[Tupac - impersonating his father]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
all I ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...
[Chorus w/ variations til end]

She's a (part time mutha)
Meet Cindi, she's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now what's that say about, this big epidemic
This hypocritical world, and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust nuff styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cuz moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiending for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip, with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch, and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggaz hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time

She's a (part time mutha)
I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, everynight, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feeling on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest, and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests, I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin if she hasn't got a fix in
So... now I lay me down to sleep
Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin how my step dad, raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class, and yet I'm missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearing it
I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he G'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut cuz my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin to your kids though
I can't believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him, and dissin her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha
I got a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
Part time
A part time
A part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)
I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off, and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cot
She's gone, and I'm thinkin that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
Cuz she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream anymore
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
And I, change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha

Y'all look like you wanted me to stay in jail
Old busters.

I got no love for these niggas,
There's no need to be friends.
They got me under survailance.
That's what somebody be tellin' me.
I know this dope is sold
but I ain't the one sellin'.
Don't want to be another number.
I got a fuckin' gang of weed to keep from goin under.
The federalles wanna see me dead.
Niggas put prices on my head.
Now I got 2 rottwillers by me bed.
I feed em lead.
Now on release.
How will I live
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did
To feed kids.
One life to live.
It's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin at your crib.
Mama, I'm still thuggin'
The world is a war zone.
My homies is inmates
And most of them dead grown
Full grown, finally a man
Just sceamin on ways to put some green inside the palms
Of my empty hands.
Just picture me rollin'.
Flossin a benz on rims that isn't stolen.
My dreams is scensored.
My hopes are gone.
I'm like a fiend that finally see when all the dope is gone.
My nerves is wrecked.
Heart beatin' and my hands is swollen.
Thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin.

Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it
Pictue me rollin.
Yeah nigga
Eh, but picture how my nigga Sak duke do it.
Guess who's back
I got keys comin from overseas.
Cost a nigga 200 G's.
I'm a street comando.
Nino for example.
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle.
So I got to floss cuz I'm rollin like a boss playa.
Thug granted to be a women layer
So mny playa haters, imitaters steady swangin.
Make me wanna start bank bangin.
So I'm caught up in the game.
Let's go change.
Packin 40 glocks.
Contain or rearrange.
All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While I'm sippin on green leaves()
In front of black lexuses, chevies on the roam.
96 big bodies sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone,
Stone facing is on.
Looking at mine but don't look too long.
I'm livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin.
It's hard to imagine.
Picture me rollin.
I gots to get the fuck up in.
Goin to lay a caper.
Cuz a nigga straight sufferin from lack of havin paper.
My bitch fin to have a bastard, see
So I need to hit a lick, drastically.
I see some bald head ass niggas and they slippin in my spot
And, uh, diggin in the pots.
Check in the park, Pac.
We caught em sleepin.
We didn't think you niggas creepin.
This how we do it every weekend
And I dump for madness()
It's time to count the profit.

Off of them, Haha
Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin, take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied, and today we stole them kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding it definitely, if they plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein here ain't livin
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost

You got a brother feelin mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin like a player, stop chasin the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin, no rushin, just takin it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, babygirl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue

Crazy, I gotta look at what you gave me, claimin I'ma criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
now I'm lost in the holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war, and got a busted jaw for sayin ""fuck the law""
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
Whats a nigga gotta do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm getting tested, and if I don't say ""yes"" a nigga quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zestin(??), I keep a vest on my chest incase the cops is getting
restless
Walkin round ready to light shit up, because my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up, other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer, I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer
Now them same mother fuckas wanna murder me, and I wonder if the lord ever heard of me

Cops wanna hit me with the book, and you hooked on my ""I don't give a fuck"" look

To my brother in the barrio, you livin worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion, you got love for the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police, don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We aint free, I'll be damned if I played a chip for a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And a nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone(huh)

wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
But when I get my check they takin tax out
So, we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy

Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit

Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no

Hoes snitched to the po-lice, now my nigga's busted
The cops whoopin on my nigga in jail
tryin to get a motherfucker to tell
And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!
""My cousin died last year and I still can't let go"" [4X]
This goes out to all you so called G's
Pour out a little liquor for your real motherfuckin partners
Don't let the drink get like that y'all, huh
Pour out a little liquor
Pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin on?
Drinkin on gin, smokin on blunts and it's on
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
Cause I'm losin all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin with them suckers til my knuckles turn purple
Mama told me, ""Son there'll be days like this""
Don't wanna think so -- I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin big and strong
and I'd love'm like one of my own, til you come home and
the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin back to back
Throwin dogs on them suckers runnin up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!
""My cousin died last year and I still can't let go""
Look at you
Drinkin got you where you don't even give respect to your partners
Pour out some liquor nigga!
It ain't like that
Tip that shit over
Pour out a little liquor!
""My cousin died last year and I still can't let go"" [4X]
This for my nigga Madman
Dagz, Hood, Silk yeah
A little liquor for my homies y'all
We in this motherfuckin piece YEAH
Pour out a little liquor
Young Queen, YEAH
This one goes out to all my mack partners
Back in the motherfuckin Bay
Oaktown still in the motherfuckin house
(Pour out a little liquor)
My nigga Richie Rich, Gov'na
(I don't care, Nighttrain, Henessey)
All my real motherfuckin partners
(Pour out a little liquor)
And all my real partnas in Marin, fuck you busta ass niggaz
Yeah nigga, pour out a little liquor!!

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now up and at em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin, I'm all in
Shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, R U Still Down?
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Raise em up... R U Still Down?
[repeat 5X]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I'm gettin high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin on with the wasted youth, please God
come and save me (save me), had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
he need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin my ass and gettin no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin lace niggaz with the game
wanna see me locked in chains, tryin to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin, see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but R U Still Down
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh REMEMBER ME
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin wrong, my mama told me, ""Baby it's on""
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin cheese
Buyin all the things on TV, and gettin skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin wild through the town
Please tell me, R U Still Down?
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 2X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
R U Still Down, to raise em up? Remember me [repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
RAISSSSE em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me? Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
R U Still motherfucking down?
Old hoe ass fake ass niggaz
We out this motherfucker

[Hook:]
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
[2Pac]
I'm smokin these niggas like they endo
Breakin em like they windows
And still they rip till they get a whiff
Of this shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me
Treat your best shot and get dropped
With your posse, nigga I got the ?mott?
I'm takin em out, a lot I got
More than you could pop
I'm rockin the spot, so now they jock
Dump em and get dropped
2Pac ain't tryin to hear it, Ox
Screamin at your box
I'm swearin at ya not so uh
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga, I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot
Takin on your gat while your girl gets hot and rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Hold it to my grave
I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some come to run while the others cause static
[Hook]
[???]
I'm comin up outta the cut
Sendin slugs to the guts
I'm bustin up outta the page cuz they got me locked up
I'm tryin to survive but there's too many playa hatin haters
Always want static, like boom holla at ya later
Homie this ain't no love in this town that I come from
Niggas be wantin funkin then I stomp em, they don't want none
Girls be on my jock and they playin me for that
But fool I can't help it cuz I was raised up like a mack
Jealous because I'm black, Jack wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me and watch the Klan bury me
Got to pack the steel for the personal protection
AK, 45's, assault rifles, Smith & Wesson
I'm no longer stressin
Learnin, gotta live long
(..?..) thanks God that I'm still strong
Get a bag a spliffs for the homies, blaze up all of these
But if you wanna flex, get in my Kool Aid punks, raise up offa
these
[Hook]
[Silky]
Just back the fuck up of me, cuz you can't get none a these
It's that OG female comin straight up out the PP's
So step to the side then raise the fuck up off me, brah
Cuz if I take it to that level I'ma light this motherfucker up
Now it's on you, you better try to lose your shit
Cuz if you don't, trust me I got you trick
You better try to choose it and lose it
Stay outta mine 'fore this shit get way stupid
These niggas I fuck with believe in passin gats
Can't leave hoe, without my strap
Not givin a fuck about nothin
Slidin through the spot with my face mask muggin
Lookin motherfuckers up and down
It ain't a future in your frontin
Why these fat niggas floatin around?
What happened to them real motherfuckin G's?
Fake motherfuckers need to raise up offa these

[Tupac] I don't want to be her man... I want to be her nigga, you feel me
[Richie Rich] Well let'em know...
(Tupac)
You fuckin wit' niggas thats insecure,
watered down -- my shit is pure
write down my number but don't call me till you sure
I ain't beggin' just tryin' to relocate between ya legs
Drippin' wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me
And now you straight beggin to sex me
Got you undressing to test me and uhh...
(Richie Rich)
Shoot me down if ya want and miss tha chance ta do it live
When I stroll by I see that look in yo eye
You wants a nigga
but think that you can't have a nigga
don't cheat ya'self, instead treat ya'self
if you scared go to church, I know it hurts
to find out me and ya man be sharin' skirts
(Tupac)
I hopin' you don't take this the wrong way
but cha body is bangin' got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin' to make my songs pay
Makin' love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive ya heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
Ya might think ya happy with him
But that's a lie...
So give this thug a try
Chorus: 2x
(Tupac)
I'd ratha be ya N-I-G-G-A
so we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
it don't matta if you lonely baby
you need a thug in ya life
cuz bustas ain't lovin ya right
(Tupac)
Now you was sprung from tha introduction
My conversations full of game yet laced with seductions
I see ya blushin' like ya want somethin'
Come get a taste of Amerikaz most wanted
And lets get into some touchin'
My erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
have no intentions of bustin'
Until ya learn ya lesson
Now many questionz are often asked
A drop top, 500 benz and plenty cash
To help a nigga get that ass
(Richie Rich)
You can ride a smoke ho
To get ya lobster and crab
Cause all i got is conversation and a game to stab
I'ma listen when it hurts
I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to SuperDave
I'll be ya nigga
as long as we can understand
that I's the nigga
smoke coke and be the man
he wine and dine
but me and you we wine and grind
and when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines
Chorus: 2x
(Tupac)
Now, it's time for the moment of truth
i got cha naked, totally sweatin'
let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin' till yah head swang
I'm so into you, witness the nigga that make the bed bang
If its all mine
then let me know
now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow
Not to mention, the multiple postions I inflict
A boss playa freakymutha fucka kind of dick
(Richie Rich)
UHH
It's on and poppin'
now you see what i was seein'
why yo eyez rollin'

I ain't goin' nowhere
Let's let that sucka stay out there
While he stress out
and I stretch out tha cock
hold tha boots and let tha nigga execute
and though you got it right
I'm going home tonight
(Tupac)
You say you don't need a man but I don't care
you in tha presence of a playa

What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
Them Thug Life niggaz be the craziest -- run up nigga!)
[2Pac]
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin drunk to keep from goin under
Gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, ""Lord come and get me""
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggaz die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught
Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon
(Yeah, niggaz movin somethin in the nine-trey
It's all about makin money, gettin yours
And knockin coppers off the motherfuckin planet

Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heav-en? (hell naw)

So fuck it! Take me I'm doin it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Commitin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin hit by a diesel in the intersection
I know you're out there help a young brother (hear me)

Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin in Hell
Like I'm walkin with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much caine in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers

Rebel.. rebel..
[2Pac]
They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
from a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain, so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister! It's time for me to
explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin MC
They won't be happy till I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face, pump up the bass
and join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from the Jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground [4X]
[2Pac]
Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse, creepin up on your daughter
While you sleep I got her sneakin out
Tupac ain't nuttin nice
I'll be nuttin how I wanna, and doin what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground [4X]
[2Pac]
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
In fact, they tryin to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
cause they don't like what I'm talkin bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin records bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalpyse is straight down

Raised in a house full of bad motha fuckas.
Mad motha fuckas.
Never had so we grab from the stacked motha fuckas.
Now they know me, the homies.
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's.
Ah shit!
Pulled up in a benzy, snatch.
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail.
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit.
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it.
To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it.
It's for the gifted. Pump your fist if you wit it.

Check it out,
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending and since my life is based on sinnin, I'm hellbound.. Rather be buried than be worried, livin held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetary
Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus, Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us. Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die. Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin? Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin warlike, drop some shit, to any stupid bitches jaws tight, I got some bitches in my crib that make my mother fuckin' jaws tight. (Repeat x5)

put your tired head on my chest
A Thug niggas in tha house

I betcha never screamed a niggas whole name out
and felt tha pleasure and tha pain
about to fuck tha very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me

and baby you can be my lady
but you gotta give a nigga space
or you'll drive me crazy
Run tha Streetz....

Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

And still I'm havin memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushin the gas when my glocks blast
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and many wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
And these bitches they still continue to per sue me
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin to screw me
even the cops tried to sue me
So what can I do but stay true, sippin 22's a brewin
now the medias tryin to test me got the press askin questions, tryin to stress me
misery is all I see, thats my mind's state
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate
Ma main man had 2 stikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed 'Thug Life!' and emptied the clip
gots tired of runnin from the motherfuckin police

One time, one time nigga one time! (Where?)
Runnin' from the police (Yeah I know what you mean)
No matter what I do, they got a nigga
still runnin' from the police
(Put them motherfuckin Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)
Verse One: Dramacydal
I ain't got nuttin on my mind, but gettin in some trouble
Lickin shots to they block leavin bloody blood puddles
for some ridah delight, now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight
It's on me, but if I die bury me a motherfuckin G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker gotta me runnin' from the *police*
Nigga, you know that's true
Catch a nigga like K-Dog, chillin wit a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all OK
'til that fuckin fake cop got to play the man
Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand
Damn, I hope it don't spill
Nigga chill, shit is real cock back my steel
Still runnin' from the police I gets no sleep
I got you peepin in my window while I'm smokin indo
But I ain't no motherfuckin track star, pig's got a Jeep
like Big Mouth, runnin through motherfucker's backyards
So I, grabs my piece before I flee
And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me
Lick shots hits spots off on my piece
Cause a nigga like Big Mouth is through runnin' from the police
Interlude: Don Gargon ?? (this is a very rough guess)
I bust off!  What about the time they pull me from the Bronco
lay, they tried to cock me, but them can't gun store
When a batty bwoy do it from the mob
Ahh, pull up your pants then you screw an left squad
Look around, look around, punk police
While gwan man doesn't a come but a bad boy test
Look around, look around, punk police
Me hafta blast back, cause de blast is best
Verse Two: Stretch, Notorious B.I.G.
Yo I was, schemin and fiendin for loots and took the crooked route
to, ghetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game
The insane brain, cold gettin fly like a plane
on them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin ruckus
Check it, I grew up a fuckin screwup
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White
And we got the workers choppin rock, Benz by the flock
And we gettin it, the dirty cops are jealous so they sweatin it
I'm lettin off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke
and provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide
We keepin it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel
Let's serve these motherfuckers slugs as a fuckin meal
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack (*heavy breathing*)
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
Summer break, my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker
Interlude: Don Gargon ?? (again this is a very rough guess)
Now it's war, me tryin to sell, runnin from the punk po-lice
They try to cock me, but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me North
Pulled up the park, I left school and left buck
Look around, look around, punk police
Was about to blast with ya gun but you can't stop me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me haf to blast back, cause blast back best
Verse Three: 2Pac
They got me runnin' from the five-oh
duckin and dodgin in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine, hoe
I'm movin swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homey slipped and now he pays the price
He did a driveby, sixteen, now he's doin triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin
I split that dove shit
Nigga motherfuck singin, I hope you got your Timberlands
on tight, cause I ain't givin up
I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm runnin' through the projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy on the, sneotch
Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven?
I'm rollin with the thorough heads
We gettin ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-oh I'm runnin' from the police

If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
[Hussein Fatal]
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey it's necessary to finish me
I'm in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them niggas they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
[Tupac]
Ever since mama got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin street
like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow
from the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath,  a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
[Yaki Khadafi]
Halfway thugs are buged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big pussy throw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked  extorting
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like haitian 5 minutes from the station
[Young Noble]
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
All the money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees shit
The glock to your head nigga, don't let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted, shot fucken backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napolean ain't no cell they can hold me in
Caucassian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some niggas fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product nigga I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with I'm some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin shit use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my niggas on top

I know the law hate me dearly, comin for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin on E

With the leaded Pac, fuck the law
Carry steal cause I live in the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin high, blazing, kryptonite  got a nigga dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em, look behind him, I see him, he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night, this motherfucken trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn, I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfuckers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit!!  I think I'm gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin with me but they dumb to see

Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bitches go to hell with em
Fuck em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug niggas daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc niggas worldwide grabbin my dick
I'll never learn take away the pain with sherm

harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(clamin that they must have changed,just because we came strong)
I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song
[Chorus: repeat 3X]

Fuck all these motherfucker's talking all this old bullshit
Like niggas just gonna accept that old trash ass shit
We ain't having none of this old shit
These niggas about to come up straight short
Casue we about to get buck wild on you motherfucker's
[Verse 1:]
You're about to feel the wrath, a psychopath when this song play
Get iller than Johnny Gill and rub you the wrong way
Fuck sensitivity I get cruel when you're doing me
Cause none of the rough stuff bitch stop pursuing me
So true to the game, it's a name you don't dare say
A lyrical lunatic when I kick it your scared straight
Motherfucker's fall way to the roster
You step any closer and get hit with a dose of
The iller-fied pimping-ass gang to bang to
And I ain't ashamed to, get wicked with slang to
Niggas know, when I flow, I can give you mo'
Get sicker than psycho, and won't let the Mic, go
Till I hear the whole crowd on they two feet
As I go through new beats, I'm running through MC's
Nigga please you dizzy, you can't take me
You stumble through break beats but you'll never fade me
Scared straight cause you hate, when I motivate
You suffer a different fate, when music I mutilate
But some of the super suckers try to stop me
I'm gunning and running the stupid motherfucker's now they jock me
What if I should trip? Or chill and a give fair break
Fuck it they feel the wrath of a motherfucker scared straight
[Chorus:]
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (Ah, yeah, scared straight)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (When your heart's beating)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
[Verse 2:]
Feel the funky funk house buster you'll get rolled on
No matter how much they bring, I duck and dodge and hold on
Best a watch the swing
Nigga the game is so strong, catch me by surprise
You won't realize your hoe's gone
Nigga I'm on the creep
And if I know your address, girls as good as stuck
She eating my Mr. Badness
Pac don't give a fuck, I got too many enemies
Fucking with the ginger juice the booze of fucking Hennessy
The closer they can get
But still don't let them see me sweat, suckers ain't trying to step
They know they'll be breathing they last breathe
Niggas ain't got no heart, but swear that they be rocking shit
Till they get a load of the bold ass 2Pacalypse
Tell them to bring the noise, and look like they wanna rift
Brother this is ain't a game, a crook's what's you're fucking with
Hitting him with the flurry, I'll bury him if he steps to me
Sucker's can't get next to me, tripping off some Ecstasy
Literal life insanity, even a form of suicide
This ain't BBD, try doing me you're do or die
Dropping them like a Mack, and smacking them like a weak bitch, nigga don't even twitch
Cause them I'ma have to pull the switch
Victory to the switch, so fuck 'em if they, try to break
Freaking 'em with the funk left them drunk
Hella scared straight
Hell yeah
Scared straight
[Chorus: x4]
This 2Pacalypse in this motherfucker
And I'm scared straight
My motherfucker partners in the house

It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
[E.D.I. Amin]
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Set it straight, regulate
wit' a bomb I'm about to detonate (Boom!)
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
ya'll niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all links in the chain, tryin to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
[2Pac]
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
but the pressures nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the clip and watch me bring em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for (What you got?)
I got the Secretz of War
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
[Yaki Kadafi]
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Down wit' no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds (Here we go)
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm layed cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Ya'll, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war
[Young Noble]
We check the murder rate percentage
Niggaz is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
you got some heat? Pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference here, with the 25 to life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like algae, niggaz be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggaz hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us

You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We go to war

Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?

Heavy hittin' at this motherfucker's straight spittin'
Diggin' deep into your brain while tryin to explain
why real niggas need to stick to the game
It's the same got these motherfuckers changin' on me
Jealous-ass player-haters gaming on me
Look out motherfucker homey-G
As in gettin' motherfuckers 'fore they come get me
Get down for the right for the wishes
Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me
Cause I ain't tryin' to hear that bullshit
Got a pistol motherfucker try to pull quick
And just cause i'm rappin don't mean I ain't scrappin
And if you clip when the shit happens, it don't stop

I want to dance with you
You can dance at the party and not get whipped [1x]

See the shit don't stop

Spin bank on thangs sellin me a sponsor on my foes
It's like each and every one they got the look of death

Don't be silly
You better watch your step
[Syke]
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin'
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!
[Mopreme]
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks

But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on 'till I die

He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do
When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze
While puffing on a Newport
plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me its a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
from the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug

Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight
and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters
if the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game 'til its a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
out with the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug
Chorus
Said he gonna be
Say he gonna be
One day he gonna be

Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin' around on the piano

I meet you through my homie
Now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cuz baby that shit was so phony
It's not phony, you see no love for my closest homies
With my pager number uhh baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision
You had them taping hoes
No, I ain't mad at you baby
Go ahead an play them fools
They choose no to listen
So now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
My mission is to be a playa
My alias is boss
Drop the top on these jealous niggas
Playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton,  Never breathing again
It's Skandalouz
I never liked your back stabbing ass, trick
Yous tha watchin' money who you baggin' bitch
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
Cuz bitches live so Skandalouz

Trying to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass kissing
cuz bitch, I'll have you waking up
with all your cash missing, I'm askin'
As if I'm qualified, to analyze
You looking at a bitch that specialize in telling lies
she got a body that make a mutha-fucka fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through her Skandalouz eyes
Blushin' , pressuring 'n popin'
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch
So why should it bother me
I've finally been sprung
Addicted to the heat of her tongue
Although, I don't know where she going shes making me cum
I've been trained as a Boss Playa
so hoochie staying, we got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me I got up
Went into her purse and took a hundred dollars
Nigga, I'm so Skandalouz
Chorus
[Nate Dogg]
She so Skandalouz (Repeated several times)
[Tupac]
Dangerous 'n Ambitious while scheming on gettin' riches
I'm spitting at tricks, cuz I'm addicted to pretty bitches
currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we mad it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me, Are begging for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool
thinkin' you could be true, when I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales of my niggas doing time in tha cell
I went from hell to living well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I ain't got no time for them tricks
I'm Heavy in the Game
I wanna be a balla please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin' me
I'm totein' free on the highway
formulating plans, I can't wait till I see L.A.

So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff

I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the ruger
To live like Freddie Krueger these nightmares just ain't as buddy

Now as I open up my story
with the blaze a your blunts
And you can picture thoughts slowly
up on phrases I wrote
And I can walk you through the days that I done
I often wish that I could save everyone
but I'm a dreamer
Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game
overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came?
Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain
Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine
To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain
And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane
Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change
But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains
Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big
And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child
All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile

Verse Three: 2Pac
Fuck the world as we ???? and witness furious speeds
of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's
Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin'
Inhalin' sherm smoke, visualized the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us
Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us
Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins
Since I ain't in many penitenturies the best revenge is fuck friends
We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly
Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies
Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain
embrace my words make the world change
And still I smile nigga
(Scarface talking)
And now a moment of silence, let us pray
And as you journey into outerspace
may the angels help to lead the way
shine up on your soul to keep you safe
And all the homies that done passed away
They there to greet you as you pass the gates
And as you headed to the tunnel's light
I hope it leads to eternal life
We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac
Smile
(Smile for me)
(All ya need to do is smile)
(Woooo smile for me)
(Come on smile for me)

Makin' it big
Over football

What take it
He did
And after all my mama's thankin' god
For blessing her child
All my mama gotz to do now is collect
And then smile

Chours:
Ohhh Won't you smile for me
(Smile for me now) 
2Pac:
Fuck tha world
As we unload, we witness furious speeds
Un-answered questions keep us all stressin'
Curious G's
Back stabed and bleeding
Crooked thoughs
Laced with weed
Learnin', duckin' stray shots
Bullets be hot
They burnin'
Inhale the shurm smoke
Visualize the flames
Will I be smothered by my own pain?
Strange wisdoms
Cowards conversate'
So quick to dis' us
Takin' pictures for the Feds
In desperate hopes they get us
Hit us all, give us plenty centuries
Forgive my stance
Sense I entered many penitentiaries
The best revenge
Is fuck friends
We milatary minded soljahs
Bustin' shots blindly
Trying to find Jahova
To help me
Somebody save me
Lost and crazy
Scared to drop a seed
Hopin' I ain't cursed babies
Maybe now
Niggaz feel me now
Picture my pain
Embrace my words
Make the world change
And still I smile nigga
Chrous till fade....

Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven)
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
Ahh, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die,
baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
to embrace an early death, now there's nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me, in my sleep
Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...
Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord knows I.. tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
so I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin noises, think she fuckin all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
to Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)
Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears..
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Rest in peace to my nigga Stretch, my nigga 'Pac
So much pain
Uhh.. yeah, huh, yeah
All my, niggas.. so much pain
Uhh.. huh, yeah
Yeah, so.. much..
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
[Ja Rule]
They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin high with my fo'-five
Cocked on these niggaz time to die
Even as a lil' nigga, you could picture me hot gun in the rain
I shed the tear, cause this nigga here inherits the pain
And now I'm labeled as a thug nigga - you know the game
Smokin weed, fuckin hoes, slangin thangs, that's the life I live
Even if I tried to go back I'd get lost (come back)
And everything I seem to love I done lost
Fuck the world if they can't understand me
What else could I do?  I had to feed my fuckin family
Yo' lies is my truth, so I'm a drug to your youth
And you don't want 'em nowhere near me, now that they can hear me
I spits razors, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of tote-slangers and chalk lines
Why do we die at an early age?
Nigga so young, but still a victim of a twelve-gauge
Feel the rage this world has bestowed upon me
And I don't give a fuck 'cause they don't give a fuck 'bout me
So I keep - drinkin Hennessy, bustin at my enemies
Will I live to see twenty-three? There's so much pain
[Chorus]
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain (so much pain)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain
[Ja Rule]
Years and years of strugglin all my life
Runnin wild as a kid, grew up blazin 'em right
I'm in a - little cell I call my soul lately
It's been a - givin me hell and my heart is screamin, ""Don't enter""
I've been cursed, for what it's worth I feel dead
Spittin to you, I know I'm in way over my head
But Lord hear me, I believe in your ""7 Day Theory""
Three souls done sent this whole world teary (can you hear me?)
Too hot for you to stand near me
It's so much pain, and niggaz wanna kill me
I'm tired of the stress and the strain
But my, grimiest grimeys got love for me
They're blazin, sendin shotguns up above for me
My face in, Hennessy with no chaser
Coke rises on every way in - keep us hustlin nigga
Me and my man got a plan to get this paper nigga
So if you owe nigga, look for the gauge to blow nigga
I figured I'd be considered a killer
Doin crime excited my mind and leadin the blind
I, can't express my compassion, my satisfaction
for gettin fucked up and blastin - we all been there
Taught from young to shoot, show no fear and lie
And wipe the tears from yo' mother's eyes - so much pain
[Chorus] - repeat 2X
(""They'll never take me alive..."" -> 2Pac)
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhhh
I'm tired of the strain and the pain

They got me mobbin like I'm - loc'd and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckers if they test me
Trust, I got my glock cocked, playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - PASSION
Better duck 'cause I ain't lookin when I'm - BA-BLASTIN
I'm a nut and drinkin Hennessy
And gettin high on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why?
Cause the stress gettin major
A buck-fifty 'cross the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real they can not see
And everyday is just a struggle, steady thuggin on the streets
And I be, ballin loc, don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin at these suckers 'til you buried
I was born to raise - hell, a nigga from the gutter, word to mother
I'm tough - I'm kickin dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin mean; until they kill me
I'll be livin this life, I know you feel me

Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin so low you think I'm sleep
But at the slightest beef, I'm robbin' niggaz sold they teeth
And no P.D can get the dick if they play toughie
Last time the niggaz rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me, ain't nothing jumping but these buckshots
And niggaz got enough knots at poppin at corrupt cops
Ten motherfuckaz catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem, now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' souljah ready to roll and take control
So now jack him while he's sleepin
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
some people panic, brothaz bugged out
I had to keep poppin' cause they wont stop until they rubbed out
And their vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunitions and the bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shottie
I finally got revenge now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Trying to keep a nigga down but ya failed
Before I let you take me I told ya
Fuck being trapped, I'm a soulja
[Chorus: Eminem]
I betcha that I got something you aint got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it aint scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G, cuz that aint me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do, cuz that aint you, you just frontin

In the '64 rag on them thangs that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the backseat nigga when we clown
Homie is you down?
Dee got the strap and she anxious
Hurry up before she spanks shit
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds
They can't hold me down
Caught them sucka ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound
A double date laced with hate
Make em pray for the judgment day

Two years later you're still on my mind
Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart?
Who holds the stars up in the sky?
Is true love just once in a lifetime?
Did the captain of the Titanic cry?
Someday We'll Know
If love can move a mountain
Someday We'll Know
Why the sky is blue
Someday We'll Know
Why I wasn't meant for you
Does anybody know the way to Atlantis?
Or what the wind says when she cries?
I'm speeding for the place that I met you
For the ninety-seventh time... tonight

Sometimes when I'm alone

All the tears I cry are bitter and warm
They flow with life, and take no form
Ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
It's painful, so sad, sometimes I cry
But no one really cares..
to ask why, why, why
Well I cry because my heart is torn
I find it hard to carry on
And if I had an ear to confide in
I would cry amongst my treasured friends
A-but who do you know that stops that long
to help another carry on
Ah the world moves fast
and it would rather pass you on by
than to stop and see what makes you cry
It's painful, so sad, sometimes I cry
And no one really cares..

Dear baby it's me
Again stuck inside this mad pen
Tryin' to pay my debt fpor all my sins
These is penitentiary times
Be so heavy on my mind
At times... it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell
Stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail
Waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks
And mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas is shady
So I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin'... so crystal clear I see it
Even though you mad at me
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come... so easily
I max out in the morning baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood
Soon as I come home...
Garb my strap
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a warzone

Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world... while I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily
Words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures... beggin' for some sex
Stay wide open keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it it real or you could die squealin'
Plus I never have to worry about a visit
'Cause you're there daily
Gaurds tryin' to get your number
You don't dare tell me
Tongue kissin' steady humpin'
Tryin' to touch you somethin'
'Fore the C.O. in the corner jump in
Frontin'
Late nights reminiscin'
Everybody's queit
I think somethin's in the air
Prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks
Steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love
And then let they heads ring
Started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the morning
It's on

Depends on how many rocks... the young nigga cook up
Narcotics got drastic
Seen 'em niggas you blated
Wantin' me in a casket
On the grind coppin' plastic

Little Moo gave the word
You get parol on the third

We out here frontin'
Still here but all about nothin'

And I'm tryin' to see somethin'

Luxury life results... livin' bad
Tricks of the trade
Shit that should've been taught by dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down

Crack done took a part of my family tree
My mom is on the shit, my daddy's splittin, mom is steady blamin me
Is it my fault, just cause I'm a young black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
""Remember Rodney King?"" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case..
.. you speak of heaven punk? I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
Duckin fuckin 'Task', now who's the jack-ass?
Keep my shit cocked, cause the cops got a glock too
What the fuck would you do - drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin the cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for the niggaz on my block
Momma tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new kid
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thick
But all good things don't last
'Task' came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolin in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps

Quiet as kept I'm blessed on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em to come and test, and arrest, nigga it's hectic

Walkin through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats, cause I'm on some ""pay 'em back"" shit
Niggaz don't wanna try me, brother you'll get shot down
Now I'm king of the block, since my bigger brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin him just be ready set
Pack ya shit up quick; and when I hit, be prepared to jet
Niggaz from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke - pow!
These punks about to get hit by the best
I'm wearin double vest.. so aim at my fuckin chest
I'll be makin straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout..
""Hit the pig nigga, break your bigger brother out""
I got a message for the warden
I'm comin for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucker makin death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin..
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin out (BANG!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja
[Chorus]
[Chorus: softly in background 0.5X]

Straight soulja, 1993, and forward..

Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world, from another level yaknowhatImean?
Starin...
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
to murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
and we turnin Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend
I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin true
While I'm starin at the world through my rearview (see)
[repeat 2X]
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die (we)
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers
[repeat 2X]
[E.D.I.]
Now you see him, now you don't, some niggaz
be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin til our dreams come through
Starin at the world through my rearview
[Tupac]
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin days in this livin black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin hotter
cause the world's gettin colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview (I say)
[repeat 2X]
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly -
and all my motherfuckers/nigga can die
[repeat 2X]
[Khadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets, somethin I learned
in school, on some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
by young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin through your rearview
[Tupac]
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, ya know/and we'll be

[Quincy Jones]
Starry night.. an unknown creation
Written by, and from the archives of Tupac Shakur
Dedicated to the memory of Vincent Van Gogh
A creative heart obsessed with satisfying
this dorment and uncaring society
You have given them the stars at night
and you have given them bountiful bouquets of sunflowers
but for you there's only contempt
Though you pour yourself into that frame and present it so proudly
this world could not accept your masterpieces, from the heart
So on that starry night, you gave to us and you took away from us
the one thing we never acknowledged, your life..

Uhh, uhh.. watch me live my art; writin words from my soul in blood
I speak the truth on every thang I love
I'll probably sacrifice my life.. to send my message through mics
It's like a war drum callin soldiers at night
It's bigger than music I spit it straight from the heart
So it's cold n dark and deep like a universe, but nah don't start

I ain't being bootsy
Crusin' in a Six-o Impala

Dear Lord
As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my nigga Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride
[2Pac]
Somebody break me I'm dreamin, I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin upstream, planted in the womb while screamin
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin white Jesus
will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetary then get smoked out, pass the weed nigga
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggaz holla at me, ""Keep it real G""
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise
[Ta'He]
Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry
[Yaki Khadafi]
I stay sharp as always
Runnin ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin crews like two's, nigga all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seeems though, be placin triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans
[Napoleon]
Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin bags
We out for power, makin cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin somethin the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise
[Young Noble]
Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin down
clutchin a pound, live as sirens, duckin the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops
[Khadafi]
In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, passion for blastin bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin jeans poppin
Leavin ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggaz is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker

I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.
And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts.
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.
Hollar ""one-time"" when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm st8 ballin'!
St8 ballin'!
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villian', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hate to stip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH!! Hey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin',
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,
We st8 ballin'!!
St8 ballin'!
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,
At point blank range cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold. Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.
Cause even when they kill me,
they can never take the game from a young G.
We st8 ballin'!
We st8 ballin'!
To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,
And once again it's on,
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it cause they're all shady.
I finally made it
now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.
What could I do? Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And mothafucka, we be ballin'!
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!

Get your score fresh
Bitch made niggas know not to fuck with us
Cause I'm livin on the edge

Wanted by the feds they got to take me dead
So fuck it try to work it in the inner city
In the land of no pity
I made it by the street fame

Super storm made it by street fame
I had to make some people feel the pain
In this dirty game
I know I'm on my way to hell
Hey yo gather it up for all the niggas that have been smoked
The hood that took me under
A nigga gots the heart
Don't get it twisted cause I'm mad with my homey's score
I kill for my niggas, my niggas kill for me
That's the love you get from your drug for you pootie
It works, see?
I'm a G
Would a gang of niggas have to reach and appeal me
Cause I smoked their homey
Well don't feel proud
Cause around here thats what makes it worse
I smoke blunts all day to keep my mind off them
They don't stop
Through my casket drop-top let me ride
All i want is Shatmo

And it don't matter if a rapper plays
Cause I cought the back of some minds

I got no mercy for these niggaz tryin to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggaz
Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggaz
Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggaz
Strictly for my niggaz makin G's
[2Pac]
Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin records
That's what they said - whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though - always kept my head up high
Eventually, I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night, always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said, ""bet,"" and never let 'em see me sweat
Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
while non-believers, were prayin for my downfall
And some would call, and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart, I'm knowin that they wish me hell
Yo get a real job, rappin doesn't pay the rent
I hate the studio cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin how you got dissed
remember how it felt, and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
Cause they can all suck dick - it's strictly for my niggaz
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
(This is) This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not, Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin to getcha
I told you once motherfucker I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin when you're fucked
Niggaz know what's up but they be tryin to hold me down
I'm comin outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin all that shit
Screamin out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggaz that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome; niggaz tried to play me with the gat
but like Terminator nigga, I'll be back
Yeah! And I'll be back with a fuckin army
You tried to harm me -- ruh-ring the alarm G!
Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
without they backup, when they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggaz at the show
so they know, not to play me like a ho (ho!!!)
Strictly for my...
[Chorus 3X (continues afterwards, breaking into ad libs)]

(Eat a dick up)
""Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
still don't nothin move but the money"" -- [Rakim]
[Verse One: Live Squad]
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin
[Verse Two: Live Squad]
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast
Straight strugglin

Live back at 'cha Westside baaaaby
Aight fuck it, we gone flip some new shit now
You heard ""All Eyez on Me,"" niggaz know what time it is
(Makaveli the Don) 'Pac do it like that
Rhymin and stealin, sellin five million
(Outlaw.. ninety-nine)
Fresh out on bail, niggaz still can't see me
(Napoleon, E.D.I, Young Noble, Fatal Hussein)
That's how it is
Now we got a new motherfuckin plan, and a new mission
(Makaveli the Don, Greg Nice, Outlaw - Outlaw)
Competition, so they say, these niggaz is gay
(Outlaw - Outlaw)
Blast me? It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin and rappin
Heard of some niggaz on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me
(Throw ya hands up, hands up)
They can't hide, listen to the rough shit, my click
(Throw ya motherfuckin hands up)
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggaz can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggaz can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll
never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggaz get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to fuckin mo', exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and niggaz still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satin infiltratin; my military mind
make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
to become a man, we sheddin tattoed tears
Chorus: 2Pac + Young Noble
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggaz can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
said many times busters still can't see
Y'all niggaz can't fuck with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this shit for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
[2Pac]	Thugged out baby!
[Young Noble]
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? HUH? WHAT?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinkin made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin tattooed tears
like Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller
[Napoleon]
Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
that'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggaz flexin
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
for the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin tattoed tears
Chorus
[Kadafi]
Shit.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin high
as life replays like time; underhanded schemes
to get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style
[Kastro]
Yo I been loosin sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en masse at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowin now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my shit in hell, talkin to the heavens
Walkin thru the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, startin with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain
I'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, cryin these tattooed tears
Come on...

(hahhh, hahaha) Hehehe, word
It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
(throw it up fool, hey nigga, haha)
Tell me how you feel homey
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crazy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentary bound)
(Now introducin Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
Just anotha wild-ass nigga
(But he was fiendin for Precious) WHAT?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein visions of people smokin and niggaz catchin vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we'll call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin
(They call the squad, hittin blocks with they guns blowin)
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin, so they kept goin
Catchin dealers comin out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them niggaz died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
to death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS

[Nate]	Will I.. forever be alone

(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)
Hopin God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin dough
She's slippin in secret places and gettin with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin
Lil' Trigga's gettin pictures of the both of 'em walkin
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disapear with another man
(and his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin
Just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS
[Nate]	Will I.. forever be alone
[Pac]	Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings

Now with the problems of poverty
and the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
how many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
(They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know)
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
[2Pac]
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin plans on gettin bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin ki's
I can't believe the shit they tellin me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg)
TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS

Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?

Tell me baby are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin me
witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
but the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show

Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
in my ride and I'm all in, gettin high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...

Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin

We at the afterparty chillin cuz we ain't no punks
Some cats is in the back with macks and gold fronts
With sacks they post up, you know we be watchin
Thinkin they got it crankin, playa we got it poppin
Now bitin over dirty work, that ain't cool
With cats in drop 'Vettes in mobs and old schools
We rob them old fools, won't you amount your scratch
Respect them young G's, they the ones that's strapped, ya know
[Snoop Doggy Dogg]
Dogg Pound, that's the sound, check around, we hold it down

Everybody around they love Snoop D-O double to the G
Cuz I'm what they love, you see

To the whale, leave em in a spell
And I got a little story to tell
For all my homies that's locked up in jail

Cuz I know y'all dealin with the reals every day and
To get killed ain't nothin to laugh about
But some niggas goin out so sideways make me wanna get me a

Meanwhile back in the lab
Paper was gettin stacked, hatas was gettin mad
Confidential information exchanged up on the regular
One dead head, two steps a my competitor
Catch em slippin cuz they just been bought
Got directions to the house and the keys to the vault
Well let me open up this bundle of money, each off a half
Pullin capers with cousin Snoop, Kurrupt and young Daz
In for the cash
Man this gang is thick
If one caught up in the track we can all get sick
And have em shook
The four O crook didn't leave a clue
Snoop D-O double G tell em what you gon do

[Q-Tip]
One two..
Dedicated, dedicated..
Yo I remember, it musta been about, ninety-one, ninety-two
Somethin like that..
We had did a show, in San Fran', and 'Pac ran up on stage with us
We was doin ""Check the Rhime""
And after he got up with us, went to the back
and he asked me if I saw ""Juice"" - figure it just came out
I remember givin him love
We always had that respect for each other heh, y'knahmsayin?
I guess uh.. we was enjoined kinda on the same path of truth
Or whatever whatever
But he still here though
I know uhm ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh I know it, y'knahmsayin?
I feel him right here
Yeah, I just feel him right here
Hah, hmm, I just feel him right here
Huh, I'ma take my time, I'ma do this joint
Ha ha ha, ha ha
The fear, in the heart, of a man
Dedicated to my heart, my ha-ha-heart
The fear, in the heart, of a man
Dedicated to my heart..
Against an attacker, I will boldly take my stand
because my heart will show, fear for no man
Before a broken heart, I run with fright
scared to be blind in the vulnerable night
Uhh, I believe this fear is in every man
some will acknowledge it, others will fail to understand
Uhh uhh uhh uhh, there's no fear in a shallow heart
because the shallow heart is faint and don't fall apart
because the shallow heart is faint don't fall apart
But feeling hearts that truly care
are fragile to the flow of air
And if I am to be true then I must give.. my fragile heart
my fragile heart
I may re-ceive-great-joy
Or you may re-turn it, say it again
I may re-ceive-great-joy-or you may re-turn it, ripped apart, hah
ripped apart.. ripped apart..
ripped apart nothing left.. ripped apart
Yeah, Tupac Shakur
Tupac Shakur
Tupac Tupac Tupac
Tupac Shakur
We miss you
And we love you
And we love you

These is hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin, planes fallin from the sky
Murder, the good die young
The good definitely die young
This is a lil' somethin'
To help you get through the day
If you could
It was more than a tragedy
Emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin' to figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God
Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans
Listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions
We should leave them a choice
Cause who are we to say who lives and die
Breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives
Needs to stop
What are we livin' for
Givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
cause Pat Bucanan say I'm greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war
But can't feed me
It's so easy to regret things
After they done
Babies catchin' murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses
In times like these we feel closest
The good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why  (2x)
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse
Cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin'
Turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin like a star
And this murder got me
Feelin like my death ain't far
And the land (?) and stolen cars
Don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms
And my father
So tell me somethin
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you
Witch world first storms (?) and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Redrey (?) Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo
Mom, Duke and Lou
>From jump
You kept it true, helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analize these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we manage
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged
They hate, how come
Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids
They growin' opus (??)
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pass
Time move quicker
No time for wastin'
Put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers
Ain't ridin' 4 3 felonys
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitolize, mobilize
We in the war y'all
It's for all y'all
My family to the ones that stabbed (?) me
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't
Man, we sho' to be done
We'll all see exactly why the good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why (2x)
[Talk]
This is for all my homeboys that passed away
And all yo' homeboys that passed away
I send this out to all the fallen soldiers
That's in the cemetaries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breather you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
I'll catch ya at the crossroads
The good die young
This song is dedicated to all them
Young kids and people that are innocent
That died young
At Columbine High
Rest in Peace (Oklahoma)
Outlawz
Lil' young Xzandafer
Tasha, all them
All the fallen kids
The dead babies
The closed caskets

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin, I'm hellbound
Rather be buried than be worried, livin held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetary
Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus
Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight.

'Til Makaveli returns, it's +All Eyez On Me+

And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be

You shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOWWW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Now since you're cryin for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nuttin left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (NOWWWW) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playin with guns
while your momma had your punk ass playin tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck THE SOURCE, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone

where every other had a pops and a motha
I was tha product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
and since my pops never knew me
my family didn't know what ta do with me
was I somebody they despise
curious look in they eyes
as if they wonder if i'm dead or alive
poor momma can't control me
quit tryin' ta save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies
a ticken timebomb
can't nobody fade me
packin' a 380
and fiendin' for my mercedes
suckers scatter
but it don't matter i'm a cool shot
punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
i'm tired of being a nice guy
i've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
so they label me a lunatic

wearin' a vest

I hope I live to be a man

counting pennys over tha years
I'd done stacked many
proven wrong those
who swore i'd wouldn't live till twenty
now they gotta cope
since it's tha only thing I know
it's difficult to let it go
i'm startin' to loose my hair cause I worry
hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried

unable to think clear

BOOM BOOM BOOM
got me shooting at a ghost
some call me crazy
but this is what you gave me
amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery
I sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
moved out west and I invest in all tha best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
put ta rest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family

Your ways are similar, to the raisin sun

Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
[EDI]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg
I don't doubt you
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you
Or them five mouths you forced to feed (uh-huh)
No including yourself
All you want is what they perceiving as greed
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck em
I was on paper
Thinking they don't give a fuck about us
[Tupac]
I'm seeing it clearer
Hating the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior
So why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watching my nation die genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath
The aftermath is y'alls
I told ya last album, we need help cause we dying
Give us a chance, help us advance cause we trying
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us
[Chorus x2]
And if I choose to ride
Thuggin' till the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in they children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
[Kastro]
Now all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply
Now that's love
Shit
Nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down
Six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song
Ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck
I don't
Feel what I'm saying?
[Kadafi]
Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic
Or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times
We busted like bubbles
With the police
This nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin certain
So I spent your time in poor and working
I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck?
[Napolean]
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga your lying
Cause half of my niggas, long gone, buried in the dirt just for trying
Sometimes I think my block is dying
And that it's awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that all fool
I wake up sweatin, dreamin, coughin
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin in the coffin
The shit comes around so often
So tell me something
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle
Doin the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well since you don't give a fuck
I be frontin
And I'ma drink my Hennessey like it ain't nothin
[Outro x2]
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die
They don't give a fuck about us
While I'm kickin rhymes, getting to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try
They don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by
Cause they don't give a fuck about us

You may remember hearing about a murder
In Las Vegeas 2 months ago
In which a popular and contreversal performer
Was shot
Gang land style and killed
It's a murder that hasn't yet been solved
But the investigation has invited closer scrootney
Of the music industry
(Fades away)

Them same mother fuckers
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me
(Ya'll mother fucking crazy)
Crazy
I got a work with what you gave me
Claiming I'm a criminal
When you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust
Heading for my grave G
I told Sam he can fuck the war
& got a busted jaw
For saying fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm Mad check the records
What's a nigga got a do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm Getting tested
& if I dont say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest
Incase the cops are getting restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
& since my life is fucked
Some say I'm slighty nuts
Buck buck is the sound as i mooova
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer
I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see whooo's realer
Now them same motherfuckers want a murder me
& i wonder if the lord ever heard of me

Them same mother fuckers want a murder me

Them same mother fuckers want a murder me
(Everytime i speak i want the truth to come out)
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me(You know what I'm saying everytime i speak i dont want shit)

[2Pac]
Nigga - I hear even the smaller G's be dippin Chevy Impalas
while flossin they gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We (?)swallow tomorrow(?) see, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em bleed tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin wine - hit grass
'til I be starin watch the parents sacrifice they child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin so strong, make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents, now dos for dose
Keep yo' friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw yo' hands in the air, it's a robbery
.. thinkin 'Pac, would you ride with me
Let's go see what our enemies talkin bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin out
This ain't livin, it's similar to prison, we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
and never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know!
This is how it goes when we floss with foes
Before I toss yo' hoe, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin
[Chorus 2X: sung]
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin in the world of crime tonight (takes a life)
Can't find a better way to break you
This ain't livin I gotta do what I gotta do
[2Pac]
Peep it - gunfire is produced at alarmin rates
Today's youth, grip the shit, get in the car and break
""It Takes a Nation of Millions"" if we intend to stop the killin
Just search your feelings, participate in some (?)
They our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue, my young nation
rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
that oppose when I froze them fools, and who are you
to watch me fall farther
I disappeared, reappeared as the .. follow me now
Skippin class, and livin fast, will get yo' ass
stuck in the pen, doin life plus ten
Young brother pump yo' brakes for me, before you choke
won't ya soak up some game from yo' big homies
This ain't livin, we givin you jewelsl, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, heyy
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me

A hell of motherfucking road blocks
And crooked cops
We still ride though

Westside
[Verse 1: Tupac]
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways
Cause every dollar counts
Bustas is jealous
And half these nigas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth
'Till I fill up with my pump
They jump
My automatic keep 'em weary
While you fronting like you Billy bad ass
Nigga you scary
I been knowing you for years
We was high school peers
In Junior High
I was itchin' to kill
And you was ready to die
While you bullshitting
Niggas was dying and catching cases
Busting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leaving no trace
They see my face and then they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry
Still I ride
I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli
Tell me to ride and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd
And muthafuckas die
It's not the way I wanna live
My nigga
It's how it is
Homie got into a fight
Last night they killed his kids
[Chorus x2]
In this life I lead
Fiend for currency
Get high off weed

Holla my set
And watch them ride

[Verse 2: Young Noble]
I ain't a killer but don't push me dog
For that family I'll send that ass straight to God (what you doing nigga?)
And in this life I lead
I've seen the most
Of my 23 years
My vision is blurry
The money is clear
Some of my peers
Eternally will sleep in a coffin (yeah nigga)
And noble on the road
I'm extremely cautious (westside nigga you know how we do it)
It happened that fast
Split second your gone
At the top of my tombstone
Put noble is raw
Outlaw
'Till I'm under the floor
For Kadafi the prince
I stack dough like a clock on the bricks
With a watch on my wrist dog
I know the time these days
We outlaws
We gonna die this way (nigga)

Pac made sure of that
Whateva you took

You know it's all for the foundation

Only got one shot to produce
On every level

Go to the max I must
Nigga I came from not much
So money I clutch
Uhuh

With a dick they whistle and ride
I put a move up on

Product of the ghetto
Been blessed fo' sho
To eat from out the ghetto
I maneuver in the right lane
Quick to push back lanes
Switch it to the left lane

And I'm plotting on the fortune
It's gettin hot and scorching
I'm thinking like a scorpion
That torturing an enemy

Money and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer (what's up Kurupt)
Steady seducing us
And I'm all for it

And the law cant spoil it
So you can call it what the fuck you want (right)
But I'm a baller alcoholic with a sawn-off pump (nigga)
My mamma ain't raise no punk
And even dead Pac
So when I jump off
I breathe for Yak
Been puttin in work
So I walk with a bop
And it safe at home
So I sleep with a glock (no mistakes)
Thug living
Ugh
What the fuck would be better
I do my dirt with the family
So we dying together

We on a mission for mo'
Gangsta shit on you hoes
We ain't fucking with you lawyers
Crossing niggas up out there dough
Trying to live godzilla

To a anybody killer
Look out

Guns in hand
Stand firm
Nuts are my pride
Now lets burn
Bound and profound
Going down swinging
Holding my ground
We the last ones breathing
No stopping till we eating
Deep in the trenches
So many killings
It's senseless
So in this life I lead
I stay protected

And this thing in my palm
Now all my hustling motherfuckers
Get your money

Love within a storm (4x)
First it was nothin', not even, a fake ?
Loneliness was a daily for me, until you came along
There was a gleam of a star in your eyes
Thought I'd never feel this way again
And you were supposed to reach my heart
And find love within, looove, looove
Oooh...oooh
Love within a storm (4x)
This sweet, wonderful ghetto love
This sweet, wonderful love that you give me
Wonderful
I could not ignore the magnetism, when I felt you near
Any problems plaguin' my mind, was suddenly dissapeared
It was re-birth of my heart, the day that you became my friend
'Cause I knew for the moment I held you, that I would fall in love again
Fall in love again, in a storm
Love within a storm (Continues in background throughout next verses)
Just when I thought I'd seen it all
Our paths crossed, amen
And I knew, from the first glance
That you, would be hard to forget
Your eyes, attracted me first
But you reeked of sultry confidence
I couldn't wait, to touch lips
And kiss, with my heart's intention
When we didn't, was what I expected
And for that moment, we erased the tension
Of the awkwardness, of first date jitters
And the initial blind date, first impressions
We kissed again; and I felt the passion
And this, my love, was Cupid's blessin'
We made love, within a storm
In the midst of passion and chaos
Somewhere, somehow, our true bond of friendship was lost
In the eye of the storm, the rain always falls harder
Those who prevail this drama
Will learn to bring their love farther
But now, the storm has past
And the seas of our friendship are gone
But as long as I live, I will remember
The love within a storm
(Love within a storm is repeated after every line)
Sweet, passionate, love-lusting love
Ya know that I miss you, and love you
Ya know that Tupac broke my heart
We need to hear ya, hear ya voice
They say, this ghetto fabulous
On 125th street forkin' around
This village, and the village uptown
South Central, Compton, Philly
Sha-Town, Southside
It's hot in 'Lanta, hot in 'Lanta
Jersey peeps, I hear ya
Miami, South Beach, uh
Yeeah, got love for you, love for you
My Brooklyn knights lovin' you, lovin' me
This open, rich city
Ya know, I got love for you

And we can all get involved
First ya'll do me, then i'll fuck ya'll
Will you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yah baby that's the price to pay, Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustla, Muthafuckin' cash game
I got you going wild cause i'm lovin you
Drugged out with this muthafuckin' thug in you.

[Chorus] (That's a nigga nature!)
[Verse 3]
Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta Papa's nuts, lustin' for creamin'
Bitches wit big butts, curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in, helped a nigga passed the time
With my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood
Follow me, I got a gun on me
Goin' for nun on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when i be thuggin' til i die
Picture of nigga in heaven high, of weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies with the phonies that died
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Dear God, understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart
In a realla nigga nature!
[Chorus x2] (That's a nigga nature!)
(Just be a nigga nation)
(It ain't my fault, that's a nigga nature)
(A nigga nature)

I throw it down this with business
They clown and try to get us
and It's so evident

drinking over a felony
and hell of me and how it will be some other shit
People telling me to cool out
But they ain't filling me

and a please passion of mine
Thuggin huggin plenty of G's
and laughing while I pass through time
And all thes back stabbers be watchin
Just keep it plain
I'm a keep it the same partner
Just take it the simple game
I can pinkle with the rain twinkling
diamonds and thangs go plinklin

and These adversaries

And Dirty money be evil
Can't be evil cuz it's filling up my tummy see
Born in a position

But there is only one way to make mo'

trying to hustle in the snow
and My bigga bro

but buy a four four
blasting at playa hating
runnin' mo'
with a Thug Passion

Putting down mashin'

To the niggas who kept them bail

Traveling this road my whole soul

with all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it
can easily stated
like my heart be gripped with the Passion
Must be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit

Make this to some high dollar gangster shit
jake a stack till we got enought bank to split

and I ain't West Coast for these niggas on the West huh?
Fuck e'rybody
Heh heh heh...

I want muthafucking police trying to pull niggas over on this one
We taking this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style Thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, feel me!!
[Verse 1]
I got my Hennessy find ya foes
in a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
you never find me broke
and who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
in that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times
peep, niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stacking G's and heat
You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew beeee
enemies and my range is on
you're in the danger zone
my fuckin' game is strong, Hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
from hustling and busting them rhymes
to my niggas up in Quentin
Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,
[Chorus]
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
[Verse 2]
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
it's like they stuck
from making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
from all the niggas that die (Rest in Peace)
cemetary full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
with my heartless style
These,
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
and even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
and Pete and Lee young G's
with a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
and tryin' to get with light skinned
cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
call the cuties cuss words but we only playing (biotch)
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
had to move to the West to regain my style

See, it ain't easy bein' me,
Life as a celebrity is less than heavily,
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around,
And it's always drama,
Whevever I wanna get around,
Mama told me,
Long before I ever came up,
Gotta be true, to watchya' do,
And keep ya' game up,
'Cause things change,
And jealousy becomes a factor,
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to MAC HER!
I'm on tour,
But still they keep on knockin' at my door,
And I got no time to work,
I'm steady wantin' more,
Every day is a test, yes,
I try hard,
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath,
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home,
All alone,
Ain't got nothin' tryin' to bone,
In my mind,
I can see her naked,
I can't take it,
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it,
I thought you knew.

(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
I thought you knew,
(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
I call you up long distance,
On the telephone,
I wanna tuck you in,
Even though I know I can't make it home,
I wisper things in ya' ear,
Like your near me,
Wonder if you feel me,
From far away,
Or can you hear me,
It seems to me,
That ya' jealous,
'Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money,
With the fellas',
In the back streets,
Tryin' to trap me,
Baby HOLD UP,
Thugs get lonely too!
But I'm a soulja,
And theres no way I'mma' makin' money,
'Cause ya' attitudes changed,
And ya' actin' a little funny,
Always complainin',
Sayin' we don't spend time,
Can't you see,
I got enough stress on my mind,
Hangin' up like you all that,
And get mad when I'm tell you that,
""I'm buys baby, call back,""
Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you,
Thugs get lonely too,
You KNOW.

(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
I thought you knew,
(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
Yeah,
(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
And I thought you knew,
(Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too)
I sit alone in my room, drinkin',
Without a dare,
Talkin out loud to ya',
Like ya' there,
Take ya' picture out my back pocket,
Man it's on,
You the first face I wanna see,
When I get home,
I wanna love you 'till the sun rise,
Buckwild,
Touchin' every wall in the house,
Thug style,
Put ya' hands on the head-board,
Think of me,
Drippin' sweat on top of you,
Sick of scenes in yo' head,
That I'm makin' love,
So turn the lights down,
Reminice 'n relax,
'Cause baby right now,
I feel you in the middle of my stomach,
You wisper in my ear,
Baby tell me how you really want it,
Hold on tight,
Watch the ceiling,
Scratch my back,
How you react,
Lets me know you feel me,
'Cause everything I'm giving to you,
Is so true,
Thugs get lonely too,
You know.

Shit, tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion
[Verse One: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
[Chorus: J. Phoenix + (Nas)]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothin but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
[Verse Two: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne
where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion
[Chorus w/o Nas]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
[Chorus]

[Intro: Makaveli]
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
and everybody got love
[Verse One: Makaveli]
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knok it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasin
Worldwide through the hard times, warrior faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, tryin to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessin, plea bargain
ain't an option now, so I'm stressin, cost me more
to be free than a life in the pen
Makin money off of cuss words, writin again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset likin the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing
[Chorus: Val Young]
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
[repeat 2X]
[Verse Two: Makaveli]
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watchin the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz gettin three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Livin life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writin to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinkin Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight with each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Makaveli]
Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson tryin to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But reconize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz gettin shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka perved out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hopin it pay
Gettin high watchin time fly, to live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)
[Chorus]
[Outro: Makaveli]
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumpin my shit
Makin my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A R people, all y'all motherfuckers

It's on
Toss it up, we took you on, and we took y'all beat
You know we beat you down, and we took y'all beat
Cause you wasn't rockin it right
Tired of suckers rockin it, toss it up, is how we did it
Yeah, toss it up now!

[2Pac]
A military mind nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know
[Chorus: 2Pac (repeat 2X)]
We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggaz I despise, look in my eyes
[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
semi-automatic Mack 11 just to scare niggaz
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
and fear of man - grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggaz whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggaz and we came in packs.
Every one of niggaz strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honey shakin
[Chorus (w/ Outlawz)]
[Fatal]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first,
facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these
playa hatin niggaz position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you.
[Dramacydal]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place;
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories
[Chorus]
[C-Bo]
I breaks 'em off with this gangsta war story tale
Stackin loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumpin insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and movin 'caine
I be the nigga that's pullin the trigga
and dumpin the hollow points in your brain
Mo' bigger balls that RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
(?) Never been no (?) men
How we bucks 'em down on the way to the ground
ain't nuttin but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin (?) and keep mobbin G
It ain't no problem (?) funk off
(?) blow down punks with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
and had them bitch niggaz hauled off
[Chorus]
[Outlawz]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscin, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up
in my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard they got to my peoples, now they livin somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sittin, holdin in anger because my parents missin
Thuggin Immortal, got some war stories for ya
[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawin from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure
cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would ya try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got cha on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories
[Chorus (repeats through to end, getting softer)]
['Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfuckin Tupac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me? Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggaz love that shit

Yea nigga! Shout out to my niggaz Fatal and Felony

"1085","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/2pac/trapped-lyrics-258.html","2pac","Trapped ","You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do
to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped....
[Chorus]
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me ?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped
[Chorus]
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone
Cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and i'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin ""Damn homies is dissin you""
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do ?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped
[Chorus]
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped

Boss of all bosses, Makaveli
Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
can you picture my specific plan
to be the man in this wicked land,underhanded hits are planned
scams are plotted over grams and rocks
when outlaw motherfuckers die by the random shots
we all die in the end, so the feds we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
me, a born leader, never leave the block without my my heata
got me a dog get nigga Mobb bitch nigga eata
what could they do to me that little brat
shit them niggas shot me and still terrified, I'll get their ass
how can I show you how I feel inside

murder murder my mind states shit ain't change since my last rhyme
the crime rate ain't decline
niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
tell me young nigga never learned a thang
dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
sniffed a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
afraid to sleep in havin' of crazy dreams
vivid pictures of my enemies and family times
God to forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
need to take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
did the best I could, raised in insanity
or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life

And if you really wanna get our message out

We we really need to start usin, our methods, y'knowhatI'msayin?

And uhh, and and.. even in our history
from a ancient Afl- African civilization
poets went from village to village
And that's how, stories and messages and lessons were taught

And so.. it it was, it was.. at it was, y'know obvious
It was, pick it up, y'know?

Life...
What the fuck is life for niggaz like us?
Been waking up to another muthafuckin' day
I'm the type of soldier,
A nigga that seen
Everything in my muthafuckin eyes
I seen my parents get killed
To my muthafuckin eyes
I seen my brother kill his-self in my eyes
I seen Pac.. Yak.. die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?
(Napoleon)
Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me
I'm seeing demons
I wake up screaming
Who believe me or was I dreaming?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes
Til they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us
That's what jail for
Adolescense young teens turned violent
It's floating, in a world turned silent
Cause you could be touched
(Chorus Makaveli)
Young niggaz in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched

Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, niggaz better slow down
Cause you can be touched
(E.D.I)
I live life High Speed
Moving a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny
Making decesions carelessly
Yeah it's me, yo nigga man child
Bomb first stand proud
Ain't looking for hand-outs
Twenty-five years up in this bitch
And I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug shit
You can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get mo' so my shit don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me
(U can be touched)
(Kastro)
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggaz
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My nigga.. Lonnie just got hit with 10... 10 years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways
So forever it's on.. baby

Why grieve this life
Planted by the fiends and pipes
Green lights so
I'm seeing-seeing everything twice
Pretty much of nothing nice
(naw) we sucking it up
Even when we get a job, we fucking it up
Like it can't happen to us
I could never be a bum
Yeah right, you wound up one
God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up
Look and learn
Next it could be your turn... word
(Kadafi)
Yes this a felonies' hobby
That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supporting me
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie,
Secretz to war licks, and score shit
Share between clients and homies
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong
And it's survive for the strong
Living outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched
(Chorus Makaveli)

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile
to my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed; you got me
inhalin the aroma of your perfume, and feelin heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin
My lyrics are poetry
So baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
layin butt-naked on the beach kickin back relaxin
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I wanna make you mine
I'm kissin on you tryin to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin at the walls
Withcha number in my hand, wonderin should I even call her tonight
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Been gettin nuttin but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us havin breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin
Come get a shot of this plain dealin and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, cause everytime we touch..
.. it's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin my fingers through your hair if you call me
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the hot', if it feel right
My only wish is to be witcha
You got me steady strivin to getcha
Fantasizin of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places, what will it take
Cause the heartache be heatbreak, is my prediction
when you falsify and start fake, in my position
I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?

Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my car
Getting wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump
Why niggaz run I'm the last one standin the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, Westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
Niggaz die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggaz tried to kill me, and I fed they wife and they daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggaz never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck quick

Scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it

With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow

Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
[Verse One:]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live
This life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes
Before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it
A player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try
Maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare
Shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it
The fighting and the hurting
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditionl love
[Chorus: 2x]
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
[Verse Two:]
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation
If could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat
When we make somethin out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three:]
I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency
I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
Cause everythang gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thang baby
Girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love
I always wonder,where would I be wiTh out u next to me
crazy and rough as Iam u will always see what I need.
[Chorus 3x until fade]

sceam, and stack green on tha crack fiends
one time can't hold me
one of these days
we gotta bust back for tha homies
locked down in tha penitentry
finaly loose my mind
if tha pigs succeed

but what a nigga really need is Thorozine
right before I die

[2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood i missed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency
But you could run to me when you need me, I'll never leave
I just needed someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thang through and true
What could I do? Real homies help ya get through,
And coming new, he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in the hood true homies make you feel good
And half the time we be acting up call tha cops
Bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until the end of time
[Chorus: RL]
So take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
[2Pac]
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money making got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walking solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
Smoking Ports think my thoughts
Then it's back to coasting
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin I'm a player I ain't sweating him
I sex his sister, had her mo' good like a Mexican
His next of kin, No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping
Until the end of time
[Chorus x2]
[2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminating easily
Fall to their knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin me to keep the peace (haha)
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a g
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
Remember me, as an outcast outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about, more
Gettin raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

They claim that I'm violent, just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin fits, cause I'm not buyin it
Defyin it, envious because I will rebel against
any oppressor, and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every Jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The underground railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin told, heard enough lies
I told em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin, motherfucker censor this!
My words are weapons, and I'm steppin to the silent
Wakin up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent

[2Pac]
The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin to rob me?""
He had tha nerve to, say that I had a curfew
(Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!)
""Get out the car... or I'lI hurt you""
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up, or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man.. aiyyo.. ay man just c'mon ?)
(""What you doin man?"") They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked (""I'm out"") he tried to run
(Freeze nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped so, I hit the cop
I kept swingin, yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(? Arrrrggggh, fuck you! Ungggh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Given him a taste, of tradin places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin this
frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin that I'm violent
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
As I was beatin on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (damn!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car, and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (damn!) we in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin that we got far
But I looked up, and all I saw was blue lights
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
Load em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot em up with they own fuckin weapons
And when we through sprayin (audi) then we steppin
This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggaz, get ya fuckin ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin for the guns to bust (What's next man?)
What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One things fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin all these punks with me
Pass me a clip G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin them a reason, (a reason) to claim that I'm violent...

[Babatunde Olatunki]
Please.. wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Where my couch, I am told, ""Hold no significance""
I waited and died in ignorance
but my inner eye can see, erase
who reigned as king in another place
The green trees were reached from fall
and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as people
War was gone because all was at peace
but now like a nightmare, I woke to see
that I live like a prisoner of poverty..
Please.. wake me when I am free
I cannot bear activity
Fall, I will have a ?, stricken blind
than to live without expression of mind

We are friends for eternity and for-ever I will always love.. you..

and once I found her I would charm her and
and she'd be mine forever (mine forever)
I found her and, indeed she is all that I, wished for and more but she
is not charmed nor intrigued (not charmed, nor intrigued)
Then I think to myself what.. can I offer her
The tears warm my eyes and blur my, vision I
stick to my stance of bravado and give her
the same uninterested look that she, gave, me
(She was so beautiful) She was so beautiful
But what.. can I offer her?
You say that you'll love me forever but
but what about today?
As the dusks become the dawns and the years pass on will you
love me (love me) the same way (the same way)?
If so let us rejoice and bathe in this constant pleasure
If not spare my heart today and I shall recover before, forever
And if my doubts and questions upset you
(forgive my fragile heart) forgive my fragile heart
I just wanted to know if you'd love me forever before today,
would start (would you love me.. would you love me..)

(hahaha)
And ugh
I started out dumb
Sprung off a hood rat
Listening to the radio
Wishing that I could rap
But nothing changed
I was stuck in the game
Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man
Listen
I've got a scheme
Break away do my own thing
Drop some conversation
Sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas they wanna see me rise
'97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case
Lord knows how they hate me
Got a playa in the court room
Please don't let them frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards
Living as a thug
Count my blessings
Don't stress in this land with no love
Maybe if they see me rolling
Look at all this green I'm holding
I guess that's why the envious
Get their eye swollen
Hoping the heavenly farther love a hustler
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me have a heart
Fuck they feelings
I've been trying to make a million since we started
We cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip
Time to mash
They asked for it
Me Makaveli I'm a motherfucker
We break bread
Now we thug brothers (huhuh)
Niggas talk a lot of nonsense
I choose to ignore
A war
They ain't ready for it (huhuh)
[Chorus]
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you
(What ya gonna do)
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you

Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you

[Verse 2: Young Noble & Kastro]
My nine is thuglord
My mind on my grind
Outlawz is my heart
They shine when I shine
My ryhme is my grind
My team be on role
Proceed with the onslaught
Indeed they on top
They all marks
And its an outlaw holocaust
When I got the sawed-off
Niggas gettin' halved off
Yer, nigga beware
Stand clear
This nigga's scared
Man I don't really care
I've been lost loved (loved)
My heart need a hug (hug)
My bite leave blood (blood)
Fight with a grudge
The life of a thug nigga, might need gloves
But you will never know
With a price on your mug
And fight strips snug right around your hands
Niggas sure you can never grab the mic again
Dog you fucking with a grown man
And I can't afford to loose
Where we from niggas told to do
So what cha ya wann' do?
[Chorus]
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you
(What ya gonna do)
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you

Watch me clown
Give me loving when I'm high
I'ma outlaw baby I'll be thugging 'till I die
In drop-top double r
Life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend
'Till they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watch them niggas out the sight of mah night scope
Cooking white dope
Got mah nigga 25 to life stretched out
Trying to have all the better things in life
Well Makaveli
A born leader 10 millimeter
Changing niggas future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heeds from out the bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the earth
And the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it alright
I'm in the studio
Making music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise
They hated 'till death
Try to beat me out my last breath

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me again, fuck friends
My foes be on a mission, tryin to do me in
Fuck em I'm out to get out, they all thought
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Maintain with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel
These are lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again
[Chorus]
Heyyy, still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby, to a young
motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make me crazy
Now how long will it take, to get a hook
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives
but man, ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell
all them niggaz that was frontin while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery
The nigga you don't wanna see
[Chorus 3X]
When I get free, believe that shit
Yeah nigga fuck your cigarette, fuck that phone call motherfucker
I'll be out this motherfucker in a few days
I'll pay these bitches back in spades
Punk ass bastards, long as my AK flexes
we gonna play these bitches
That's how we do this shit
Fuck that I'm out, C.O. turn the fuckin lights out!

[Sonia Sanchez]
When your heart turns cold
I say, when your heart turns cold
it causes your soul to freeze
It spreads, throughout yo' spirit
like a, ruthless, feeling disease
The walls, the walls that once were down
now stand firm and tall, safe from hate love pain joy
until you feel nothing at all
When, your heart turns cold
I say, when your heart turns cold
A baby's cry, means nothing
A dead corpose is tri-vial
Mother's neglecting children is daily
Loneliness, becomes your routine friend
Death death death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
if you even sleep at all all all
You forget ideals and, turn off the reason
to make sure the product gets sold
You don't UNDERSTAND how I behave, just wait
I say just WAIT WAIT WAIT til your heart
I say til your hearts turns COLD!

Big money clutchin, bustin while evadin cocaine busts
My pulse rushin, send my (?) into insanity
Shout at my cousin now we bustin if they yo' family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. cause I'm fuckin his secretary
I black out and start cussin, bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic and bitches duckin, I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
why I had to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homey's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin hits out on politicians, even cops, I ain't lyin
They got me sleepin with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin
What is the meaning, when thugs cry?
[Chorus: singers]
Oh why, children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God..
Oh why, does it have to be this way, our

Let the children hear when thugs cry

Heh.. maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin
Where is the love? Never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggaz I used to love, enclosed in penitentiaries
But still homey keep it real, how does it feel
to lose your life, over somethin that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with yo' pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
to help us grow at times, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters, to niggaz and bitches
We went from welfare livin, to worldwide riches
But somethin changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine.. mayne
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See you gotta get high or die, cause even thugs cry

And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless that my attack'll take command of your dreams
Leavin motherfuckers drownin in they own blood
Clownin takin pictures later
Laugh bout the punk bitches, that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin yo' people disappear, you wonderin where they went?
Am I cold or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body God, don't let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes, when thugs cry

blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach

Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz

See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell
How many niggaz wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz

Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?
Power.. enter my world
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
the motherfuckin law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) -- [repeat in background]
Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas
Killin kids, puttin this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
[singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here']
All you niggaz out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?
Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?

I'm just saying
This song is for y'all
For all the times I mess up
when we mess up
Dear sister
Got me twisted up in prison
I miss yah
Crying
Looking at my nieces and nephews picture
They say don't let this cruel world get yah
Kinda suspicious,
Swearing one day you might leave me
for someone that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle
I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make if I have to Beg and Borrow
Reading love letters
late night, locked down, and quiet
If brothers don't receive their mail
Best believe we riot
Eating Jack mat
Staring at walls of Silence
Inside this cage
Where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons
Never fall for riches
Apologizies to my TRUE sisters
Far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation
Reperations are due
Its true
Caught up in this world
I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them
Precious boys and girls
Born black in this white mans world
and all I heard was
[Chorus]
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone
Being born with less
I must confess
Only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homies head
Died in his rest
Shot him to death
and Left him bleeding for his family to see
I pass his casket
Gently asking
Is there heaven for G's?
My homeboys doing life
Begging mama be stressing
Shedding tears
When her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at?
Mama, Why we live so poor?
Why you crying?
Heard you late night
Throught my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama?
Why do they keep calling me nigger?
Get my wieght up, with my hate
and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
Still thugging in this jail cell
Missing my block
Hearing brothers screaming all night
Wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black
But why do we act like
We don't love ourselves
Don't look around
busta (you sucka)
Check yourselves
know what if means to be black
whether a man or girl
we're still struggling in this
White man's world
[Chorus]
(we must fight)
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone
So tell me why you changed
Choosing new direction
In a blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection
You think I'd die
Not gonna cry
Why should I care
Like we holding on to love
Thats no longer there
Can you please help me
God Bless me please
Keep my seeds healthy
Banging on my enemies Bleed
While my G's healthy
Hoping they bury me
With ammunition, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven
Ain't no G's hell
Sister sorry for the pain
That I caused your heart
I know I'll change
If yah help me
But Don't fall apart
Rest In Peace
To Latasha, Little Yummy, and Kato
To much for this cold world to take
Ended up being fatal
Every women in America
Especially Black
Bear with me, can't you see
We're under attack
I never meant to cause drama
To my sister and Mama
Will we make it
To better times
In this white man worlds

[Intro: 2Pac]
Let us pray
Heavenly Father, hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me, who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
I see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watchin our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God cause we livin in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer
[Chorus 2X: 2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Can't close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddeon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if I'm worthy
Livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
So I'm askin -- before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change? I'm askin
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Kadafi]
Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck
with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
If you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin, Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
Cause he just came home off of bail
[2Pac] Now tell me
[Chorus]
[Outro: spoken word]
Who do you believe in?
Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?
Is it Jesus? Is it God? Or is just yourself?
Definately not to be imposed, being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing!
Men, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry, or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand, that every man, is his OWN man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man
[2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
[singing while 2Pac speaks]
Who do you believe in? Put my faith in God, and
Blessed and still breathin
[singer + (2Pac)]
Even though it's hard (Who do you believe in?)
That's who I believe in (Put my faith in God)
Before I'm leavin (Even though it's hard)
I'm askin the grievin

I went from, nothin to somethin now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggaz gettin money
I made a song about my enemies and niggaz tripped
It was hip-hop until Tupac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggaz hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggaz get paid
Have me catchin cases all across the nation
I went to jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin three strikes, and we might
just blast God bless the child that can get cash
But all these niggaz turnin and never learn
Got a long line of niggaz player hatin me but gettin burned
Talk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag
Like the Mack make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back pay

Approach the juvenile delinquent, we still decent
Playin catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? {*laughter*}
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat
Fuck {Wendy Williams} and I pray you choke
on the next dick down your throat, for turnin on me

I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll
Anybody ever seen {Wendy Williams} fat ass?
Why you always wearin Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat hoe
I'm puttin Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
and put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's Tupac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
and Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
he shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
he don't step in the fuckin ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what Tupac gon' do
When niggaz come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin other
This old motherfuckin nigga in the South told me nigga

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.
In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga
played your ass.
It was said you were sleeezy
even easy
sleepin around for what
you need
See it's your thang
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free
or make your money on the corner.
But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.
Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.
Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by
you can show them fools.
But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.
Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.
I love you like a sista
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.
Got them legs wide open
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga
'bout his car.
I guess he said he
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex
I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.
And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.
It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.

[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now
More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.
Got a dinner date
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.
The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.
I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back
in the first place.
I remember back in high school
baby you was fast
straight sex
and barely move your ass.
But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.
So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped
and left you on your own
See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.

[Outro: 2Pac]
Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker
keep stressen me
fuckin' with a muthafucken mind
I figured you wanted to know
you know
why we call them hos bitches

strictly business
So If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
If you wonder why we call U bitch

Now of course I want peace on the streets
but realisticly
painting perfect pictures ain't never work
my mysery was so deep
couldn't sleep through all my preasures
my quest for cash
I learned fast
you survive voilent measures
memorys of adalicent years
their was unity
but after puperty we roll over
to our community
so many bodies dropping
its got to stop
I want to help
but still I'm stepping
keeping my weapon
must protect myself
promise of a better tomorrow
ain't never reaching
plus my teachers were to petrfied in class to teach me
sipping thunderbird
and grape kool-aid
calling Earl since my stomach was empty
it suduced me to fuck the world
watch my lil homiez
lose there child hood to guns
nobody cries no more
cause we all die for fun
so why you ask me if I want peace
if you can't grant it
niggas fighting across the whole planet
so we can never be peace
(Chorus)
We'll never be peace, or all we all just headed for doom, still
casumed
by the peace, and i'll know there never be peace, thats why I keep my
pistol when i walk the streets cause there never be peace

No time to rest
they stressed out
I can't remember the days my homie was here
now a days we live in fear
the stuggle is still here
so now who's grabbing there strap
who's getting bucked wild
representing the generation of killers
when I was a child had many dreams
reality kept me and my homiez stressing
tyring to raise my baby girl to be the strongest
know when I'm doing wrongest
I never had a bright day
just drunkless smoking blunts
getting faded
wishing my partna made it
if it was peace
or ???????????
I know there will never be
all my tears were shed
when I lost my homie number three
it's getting harder to see
impossibilty should we just face it
can't get through the pain
but still I can't erase it
so many trials and tribulations
things we facing
wicked days
can't see no brighter days
it's time to chase it
cross dreams
cause the scene is when you never get by
thats why I got to stay high
you'll never know when you'll die
my heart will never leave the ghetto
I know to rise only in peace
thats why I say
there ain't never going to be no peace
(Chorus)
(Storm)
Living life lonely
but I can't even cry
cause visions of diseption
all around me
got my eyes full of despise
who can I trust
why even try
they say the world is mine
but I know that's a lie
living to die
set up from birth
steady dreaming
wishing for better days
but all I see is demons
close my eyes
reminisence of my childhood
all I felt was pain from my arrival
no memories of nothing nice
nothing but blinded reminders of my future life
I'm freaking out
I'm getting closer to that other level
will I be strong with game
or just the heartless devil
I hope I'm able to find peace in me
cause theres a storm sixty four inches deep in me
and I try to do the right thing
but it's the wrong thing
that seems to bring me right back
to this dirty game
there never be peace
fuck peace

So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching childern
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty
This is defaintly ahhh words of wisdom
AMERIKA, AMERIKA, AMERIKKKA
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidience
Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The american dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleave, don't believe
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgeting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
NIGHTMARE thats what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for Four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
ha ha
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow
2pacalypse America's Nightmare
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob America's Nightmare
Above the Law America's Nightmare
Paris America's Nightmare
Public Enemy America's Nightmare
Krs-One America's Nightmare
Mutulu Shakur America's Nightmare
Geronimo Pratt America's Nightmare

Uhh.. world wide mob figgaz..
World wide mob figgaz.. we world wide mob figgaz
World wide mob figgaz.. (check game you little young punk)
We world wide mob figgaz.. (all you niggaz is jealous cats)
[Verse One: E.D.I. Amin]
What, what?  Uhh, put them hands up
Rich niggaz throw the grands up, and what?
I got a plot to get what's mine in the nine nine
It's my time motherfucker try to stop it gon' see nine nines
(??) that's all I see when I open up
Baby girl, fuckin you now before I blow up
You know what?  I seen your kind before, high saditty
but really like it raw in the closet
Like the rider type of whore, by the shore, I could (?) trick on her
But I'm collectin these vicks when I put the dick on her
O.U.T., L.A.W.Z.
You fuckin with a nigga livin destructively, pump and pee
Tuckin T's up in the house when I jump on
I'm tryin to handle my business full grown
This shit is on, it's gettin crazy after dark
Where the real thug niggaz here you are
We world wide mob figgaz
[Chorus - Young Noble: repeat 2X]
We got homies on the front line livin it up
We got ladies in the back straight givin it up
It ain't nothin but a thug thang
World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang
World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang..
World wide mob figga let me see a nigga nuts hang..
[Verse Two: Napoleon]
Nigga duck down bust first, make 'em feel somethin
Shouldn't shot your gun if you ain't kill nuttin
Now you gotta face the death man got flow heavily armed
Outlawz did that, heavily gone
Took a ride with the left of us, best of us
Plus we wake up with our tec on us
We test yo' nuts in a heartbeat, sleep on the street
Obey the rules of the ones who want yo' beef I'll eat
Y'all niggaz weak, in a motherfuckin way it's so pitiful
I'll leave you motherfuckers critical
We heard the slick shit you said on fuckin Too $hort tape
But you only stepped your way into an early wake, early grave
That's what you brave niggaz get for fuckin with this
You had your chance to mob first you didn't you missed
Just switched to fake
Napolean be the motherfuckin last nigga with the gat to break
The last to fade, earthquake aftershock, is what you got

Hey watch out man, look out

Hypnotic to drugs it's the straight thug nigga in me
I swoop down and cause havoc
My rapid delivery, is automatic lettin niggaz have it
I've been labelled as a thug nigga
Since they don't sell my shit to white folks
ship it to the drug dealers
And catch a catch a nigga world wide
A fuckin mob figga West coast, who-ride
When we rob niggaz money make my squad bigger
But we ain't sell our souls
Bustin on my enemies, murder my foes
At my shows I'm a nut, lights camera time for action
Now get to clappin to my cuts, a world wide mob figga

Yo, I can see
That you obviously don't know me or my homies
We O-U-T Lawz, fuck the phonies
A wise hustler once told me, it's on you
Though it was dreams when he first told me Now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain exstend
Niggas ain't worth shit
Cops and ride dick permits
I heard this and heard that
About them O-U-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot
Some of them soldiers fell off
Fuck yall now everybody tied to us
Hollering out a nigga name
But never said what up
That shit critical, dispicable, unforgiveable
I too like Hot ??
Your own fan won't remember you
Thuggin but we still spriutual, clear lyrical
I'm like the fuckin Deff Squad
My ears ain't hearin' yall
Pump fearin' yall
But damn I ain't even wantin' to scare yall
Listen to what I tell yall
Fuck the world,
Your baby moms and your baby girl
You muthafuckas so fake,
Yo they made me wanna earl
Blake, hate snakes thug hatin the degree
Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate thug niggaz
(Napoleon Chorus)
We will never fall
Thru it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us
(Napoleon)
Now I been trapped down
And fucked since day one
This industructional style of mine ain't no fun
Where I'm from
You sure to see about 10 niggaz in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life
Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical
Then one of them sat down living so
Mystikal and empoious
With a heart full of anger it's so redicilous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute
With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?
I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the dick to your wife
And I'm the Jesuz of your Christ
You dig that? respect this
I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me?
We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that estacy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed
I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This ludacy then with me, then with chemistry
Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me
(Young Noble Chorus)
We will never fall
Thru the war, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
(E.D.I)
When we was kids, the loving felt good
But of course have the respect
Though it's even better
Now for this chedder
Niggaz is laying deader
Then Malcom and Martin put together
Oh Lord only knows where we'll end up
Remember what Pac said
Watch the fuckin signs
But we wasn't listening
Too busy trippin off his shine
Now one time for my muthafuckin' Outlawz
Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro
May we all roll
And if you don't know
We got the rap game petro
Scared cause we bout to release
Like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground
We running the ghettos
Stealing all of ya fan base like we kleptos
Bitch I can't let go
I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
And niggaz is stealing my shit
And busting it wrong
Hot shots holla back when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin back at the system
Military wisdom
Preparing myself for armegeddom
Breaking my balls at this game
Knowing it's a dead end
And my only weapon
Is my believe that I'm superior
Yeah we the muthafuckas
That you niggaz is liery off
Controling my steam
Knowing my team to deserve more
Fuck the reframe
Stick to the game and earn more
Holding my head, rolling the head with focus
Laughing inside
Cause deep inside y'all don't know us
(Young Noble Chorus)
We will never fall
Thru it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us
We will never fall (Never)
Thru the war, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthafucka soldiers
And if you believe in that shit that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us
(E.D.I Talking)
Ain't never know niggaz like us boy
They don't make niggaz like us no more
Thug in Peace.. to all my niggaz (Never)
See ya soon.. uhh

Young black male
I try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
Cuz I ain't equipped to stop how I look
I don't sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hittin em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fuckin the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go, with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males
Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz
Ay nigga you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!
Hit that shit, that's the shit!
It smell like skunk, skunk smell like that nigga momma
We ain't nuttin but some low down dirty niggaz
Keep it real nigga, fuck you nigga!
You ain't givin me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that Hennesee
Can I drink with you fellas? Can I get it on it?
Fuck you capo. You ain't in baby.

and all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas
As a young nigga, I'm almost ?swellin? in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin to make a bill-ion, can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
_Me Against the World_ stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
I'm tellin you..
.. to be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that
Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga
Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin nuttin
Tryin to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
and I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz
break away from these dumb niggaz
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
puttin niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin
at the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin
Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
the epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin hopeless, where
more and more borhters givin up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
and I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
For these young niggaz
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
Memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known
