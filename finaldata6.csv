You and I, 'til the day we die.. (day we die..)
Yo, yo
Ex-girlfriend, how you been?  I see you still
tryin to fuck with other women men, remember when
I first met you in my cousin's house, a week later
we was fuckin on your momma couch, now it's been said
that big girls they don't cry, but they damn sure lie
Look you in the eye, sayin you they only
You and I, til the day we die, said you'd never
leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I
turn my back you' try to fuck my homies, that was then
this is now I got a new friend, ever since
I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
about leavin the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me, now you on
your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin mad ways to trap me, lookin at my girl nasty
Tryin to throw the pussy at me
""Now look at this bitch over here tryin to act like me""
""Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers""
[D'Angelo]
I was really lovin you babe [8X]
[Method Man]
Yo yo
It's always you and your crusty ass crew, be actin new
Let me find out that you fuckin with Boo, and y'all gon' feel it
Waitin for the day that you front, and catch a lump
from my black butterfly, that arm pack a lullaby
Sleep on her, she said you bitches tried to creep on her
in the mall and didn't know she had the reach on her
Pearl-handled twenty-two, my Boo
She go ahead and walk her dogs, and represent Wu
to the fullest, you and her can shoot the big one
I'll bring the bullets, knowhatI'msayin?  Stop playin
You and them dyke lookin bitches
Actin like y'all jumpin somethin, go 'head with that bullshit
[D'Angelo]
I was really lovin you babe [8X]
[Method Man]
Got tired of the games, the lies, the feeble alibis
Now you fuckin with the next guy, a Thug Nigga
Derelict be actin bugged nigga, show this nigga
mad love but get no love nigga??  Stupid ass
Plus I heard that he be beatin on you, I seen him
at the club cheatin on you, witcha best friend, got you stressin
And used up, pull your shoes up, all you need's affection
but you're headed in the wrong direction
Tryin to make this nigga jealous, with other fellas
All up in my face actin overzealous
Like you want somethin from Meth, I hope it ain't love girl
Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable
misery love company, shit I'm livin comfortably, don't need no
nigga huntin me down for fuckin round, with his kitty
Talk to him, before my brother put a spark through him
Won't be pretty, the situation got my whole attitude shitty
And got you actin high saditty with your slut committee
You know I know; so go find another sucker yo, I been there
and been done that befo', and don't need it no mo'
That's, my, word!  So go to your room with that then
and tell that big-haired nigga you run with to do the same
Cuz I can be bad by my mothafuckin' self
[D'Angelo]
I was really lovin you babe [8X]

Yeah, Okay, Yeah,
Back for another one bitch,
Let's go, Ha,
Staten Island stand up,
Strong Island stand up,
Yeah, Brick City nigga,
Funk Doc.
[Method Man]
Yo, I'll start this rhyme with how yall feel in this bitch,
I'm fiendin to spit, Got steel in my grip,
But I aint talkin bout guns, I'm talkin mics, Niggas stealin my shit,
Then try to act like they aint feelin my shit,
Down for talkin bout one, Fuck your feelings, I be talkin in tongues,
Fuck where you from and all the niggas you brung,
Punk, My clan don't sleep son, I put that on each one,
Be cool until the heat, Call me pussy might eat some,
Nigga this is not pop music, Unless your tryna pop shots to it,
Why would you have that glock and not use it,
How could you hear this joint and not lose it,
You stupid, You need to shot from cupid to get love for this music,
Diamond in the ruff, Like iodine, Find me in the cut,
If not prolly find me in a slut, If I buy me a Dutch,
That means Mef Mans, Back with the stuff, Lot of back talkin backin it up.
[Chorus 2X: Method Man]
Now I like bein a man, I like weed in my hand,
I like my cheese in advance, But yall don't understand,
Me no like, Fake niggas that aint got the game tight,
Me no like, When yall killas pop shit and can't fight.
[Method Man]
Back in the zone, No backbone,
He stepped on and spat on, Niggas don't last long,
If I don't get some act-right soon, I'm gonna act wrong,
I aint tryin to get clapped on for makin these rap songs,
If your misunderstood Pink, What would the hood think,
To know that I've been Swindled, Bamboozled, and Hoodwinked,
These rappers aint like me, They see that there might be,
More to me then some Air Force Ones and a white tee,
I'm nice B, 6 foot 4, Un-cut raw,
Pocket full of straws, I'm that nigga to look for,
One paper like a book store, Aint never been shook poor,
I switch from Method Man to Candy Man and the hooked off,
Still aint nothin sweet though, Who wanna spit flows,
First learn to put the weed inside the bag and then get dough, (Then get dough mothafucka)
Tell your peoples and kin folk, I been dope, Anything else is an insult. (God damnit)
[Chorus]
[Method Man]
So obnoxious that I'm toxic, Call it diabetes, Spit that hot shit,
Cause I'm hot bitch, And got butter-fingers, Opps I drops it,
Load and lops it, Take the recipe that’s been concocted,
Got women just like a vehicle, Topless,
Look first, You'll see what I'm worth, Pullin paper straight out the wood work,
Until I push dirt, Shit I hate to fuck up a good shirt,
But damnit I'm back, I can relax, Shot a dos of some murder I wrote, Then lean back,
I'm part Ghost, Part Cappa, RZA, And Deck,
Part Dirty, Uey, GZA, Masta Killa, And Chef,
But I'm all Mef, All vet, Killers I'm complex,
Niggas, Have yet to blow up, Nothin but bomb threats,
New York yall, Shoot or shank me, I bleed Yankee,
I'm hot dog, Yall aint nathan to put it frankly,
I find excuses to finally lose, Then write exclusives,
And eat like VH1, You know behind the music.
[Chorus]

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah (Yo)
[Method Man]
Damn, I hate it when it rain
Ever since I came in the game
Some hated on the fame
A lot of niggas done changed
And started actin' strange
Even labels turning they backs
And started backing lames
Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
when in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real
Chorus: [Lauryn](Method Man]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)
[Method Man]
Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man
Repeat Chorus
Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines
Repeat Chorus

Playin my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin
on MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
from my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie, runnin who?
Fuckin punk, get a speed bump comin through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu
[Redman]
Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit I'm drivin in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic
[Canibus]
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attatched to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin niggaz to death and beatin dead niggaz to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
if the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild, who wanna act fly and
get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin a hundred
when I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it
[DMX]
Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
so I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat

[LL Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewher cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
with one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
and try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin up a ball, playin with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challengin Roy to a fight
Snappin, you ameteur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uhh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
to play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time

Yeah yeah, now, oh

Uh Oh like Lumidee, if Meth ain't that shit by now, I'm soon to be
When I choke hold mics, I don't give em room to breathe
I'm just doin me, but bitch if you fine, I'll do you free
By now if you don't know who it be, don't make me tell
Just know I Killa Mike like that kid from ATL
If you fail to plan, baby plan to fail
Man my game ugly as that nigga Sam ???
I'm so funky, I can't even stand the smell
Come on, life's a drag, roll it up and inhale
Don't get comfy, I cramo your style like a monkey
Even +Deemi+ needs +Moore+ than Ashton Kutcher to punk me
My four five barks
Just one shot is enough to clear the block like it's time for 106 & Park
Staten Island dropping your ass, we mean business
With guns that put a shot in your ass like free clinics
Yeah, and I ain't finished with the menace
Uh, nah, and I ain't finished with the menace
Uh, nah, I ain't finished with the menace, come on
Now, oh shit, low and behold
RZA and Meth got another ninja scroll
Man I end your foes
Send chills down their spine like December cold
Never been before like a ?wallet?, can't call it, won't pretend to know
Wack shit, turn my back on it like a friend that stole
Been in the game ten years, I got ten to go
It's the prince and the dark knight, let's begin, ayo, call me Mr. Low Maintenance
Tell them hoes I'm like a doctor that lost his lisence, I got no patience
Or got time to wastin, if you ain't fam, you ain't relatin'
These hating hot dog rappers is bakin
Without love, like a stoner without bud
Your ass is as flat as a soda without suds
Who got the nerve to think that Meth can't rhyme
Put a nine to your skull and get that out your mind

You've just been fitted for them seeman shoes
This is bottom of the lake raps

And brauds got the nerve to act funny

We both know, that our love will grow
And forever, will be you and me...

Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
That don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and put it on me
If I need that, plus she understand me when I beat that
It's sweet like candy, this time, I might just eat that
You steal my heart, sweetheart, then you can keep that
Let's bar hop and find us a spot where we can chief at
Push the seats back, you got the kinda body niggaz beep at
Try to speak at, but get no feedback
Sophisticated, Miss Highly Edumicated
Living well, lady that made it, type of woman you stay with
[Chorus]
[Method Man]
Give me a queen that respects a ""king"", just like Coretta
Get everything except the ring, for worse or better
Even through the stormy weather, rain, sleet, snow
Whatever, see if it go down, we go together
Like Twix bars, ain't no problem that we can't fix, ma
You ain't gotta sugar my tank, or key the kid car
Cuz broken hearts leave big scars, when emotions get hit hard
Niggaz get drunk and hit the strip bar
But that ain't even ya man's style, even back as a manchild
That's where I stood, and where I stand now
I'm throwing rocks at your window pane
Trying to bang, girl, like injure pain, you know the game
[Chorus]

No matter what we go through (what we go through)
I'll be there for you (there for you)
I'll never let you down, I'll just hold you down, oh-oooh
No matter where we be (where we be)
I'll do it all again (all again)
The ups and down, I'll hold you down, oh-oooh
[Method Man]
Give me a woman that get down for me, my one and only
She don't fuss or fuck around on me, or leave me lonely
Not just a honey, but a homey, just wanna hold me
Cuz she got alotta love for me, and now I gotta
Lotta love for her, might even take a slug for her
And everywhere we go, pull out that red rug for her
Yeah, them back rubs in the bathtub, got me cleaning my act up
I'm ready to shack up, now that's love

Nobody can love you like me boy
I'll promise to be your only girl
Don't ever leave, just stay
You will be down for me, anyway

[Method Man]
Playin my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
finger itchin with two broke legs, now I'm trippin
on MC's cliche, shot that ricochets
start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly, tap your jaw
from my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shittin in your last Huggie, runnin who?
Fuckin punk, get a speed bump comin through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu
[Redman]
Aiyyo I put it on a nigga, shit it on a nigga
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex hoe
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads gobblin
Shit I'm drivin in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be takin notes
I drop like I shoulda invented the raincoat
Absolut, I love to burn to the roots
I keep comin til your pour sperm from your boots
Vigilante hardcore to the penis
Tell you fuck you my attitude is anemic
[Canibus]
I'm the illest nigga alive, watch me prove it
I snatch your crown witcha head still attatched to it
Canibus is the type who'll fight for mics
Beatin niggaz to death and beatin dead niggaz to life
When you look at me long enough, I start to read your thoughts
if the signal was strong enough, and then I'll call your bluff
like, ""Yo, how many rhymes you got?"" I think I'll go on
for more Milleniums than Mazda's got on the car lot
And there's nowhere to run ta, when I confront ya
Nigga, I call your bluff like you had a phone number
Who wanna see Canibus get wild, who wanna act fly and
get shot down with a surface-to-air missile
I take em on in all shapes sizes and forms and spit on
anybody who ain't close enough to shit on
Zero to sixty? I'm already doin a hundred
when I'm blunted and I give it to any nigga that want it
[DMX]
Stay out the dark, cause if I catch you when the sun is down
Run it clown, come up off that, or I'm gon' gun it down
When in doubt, however skull goes, it's gon' be that
See that, that shit'll finish you dawg, believe that
Where we at, do your value your life, as much as your possesions?
Don't be a stupid nigga, learn a lesson
I'm gon' get you either way, and it's better to live
Let me get what's between your sock, cause it's, better to give
than receive, believe what I say when I tell you
Don't make me put your somewhere where nobody'll smell you
And when the lights is out, they don't come back on
This ain't a flick you ain't gon' come back on, you ain't that strong
You knew it was wrong, but you asked for it baby
You'se a pink nigga, ski mask for it baby
so I can hit you up on front teeth, you think I'm sweet?
Want heat? One deep, leave him behind, front seat
[Redman] Aiyyo, one
[Meth] two
[Red] three
[Meth] four
[Red] five
[Meth] six
[Red] seven
Blaze the hot trizack
[Method] Shine like heaven
Seven

[Redman] Come on Mr. Smith, come get some!
[LL Cool J]
When young sons fantasize of borrowing flows
tell little shorty with the big mouth the bank is closed (yeah, word up)
The symbol on my arm is off limits to challengers
You hold the rusty swords I swing the Excalibur
How dare you step up in my dimension
Your little ass should be somewher cryin on detention
Watch your mouth better yet hold your tongue
I'ma do this shit for free this time this one's for fun
Blow you to pieces, leave you covered in feces
with one thesis (""LL Cool J is hard"")
Every little boy wanna pick up the mic
and try to run with the big boys and live up to the real hype
But that's like pickin up a ball, playin with Mike
Swingin at Ken Griffey or challengin Roy to a fight
Snappin, you ameteur MC's
Don't you know I'm like the Dream Team tourin overseas
For rappers in my circle I'm a deadly disease
Ringmaster, bringin a tiger cub to his knees (uhh)
In the history of rap they've never seen such prominence
Your naive confidence gets crushed by my dominance (word up)
Now let's get back to this mic on my arm
If it ever left my side it'd transform into a time bomb
You don't wanna borrow that, you wanna idolize
And you don't wanna make me mad nigga you wanna socalize
And I'm daring every MC in the game
to play yourself out position, and mention my name
I make a rhyme for every syllable in your name
Go platinum for every time your grimy ass was on the train
Watch your mouth don't ever step out of line
LL Cool J nigga, greatest of all time

[Intro: RZA (Method Man)]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (roll it up niggaz)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (4:20, y'all, it's time, it's time)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (it's been a long time for this man
Niggaz been sleeping on the kid, man, everybody got some sideway shit to say)
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it (Carlo! Know what I'm saying, man? Yeah)
[Method Man]
Fast or slow mo, oh no, Meth done made a killing
Call the po-po, oh niggaz is squealing, oh, y'all ain't feeling
Niggaz no more, the bigger they are, harder they go though
Good pussy put a hump in my back like Quasimoto
Hah, my sex ain't homo, season vet, hold the adobo
Got rappers on that low carb diet, y'all can't get no dough
I keep a low pro, file, excuse me as I get smoked out
Put hands on these niggaz, then put the roach out
Go head, I'm wishing you would, ask if it's good
Man, this Tarzan shit in the woods, my shit is hood, bitch
That means I'm hood rich, telling you lies
Straight out the pull-pit, it's like Merrill Lynch I'm on that bullshit
Real spit, money come first, and even worse
You need all your toes & fingers to count up what I'm worth, trick
So when I blow a smoke cloud in your face, just take a hint
Dick, you crowding my space, it's Mr. Meth, pa
[Chorus: Carlton Fisk]
It's 4:20, roll up, nigga getting smo-ked out
No seeds, California weed have you choked out
No doubt, roll up, which rims spoked out
4:20 mean you either roll up or roll out
[RZA]
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
Roll that shit, light that shit, smoke it
[Method Man]
So on and so on, I flow on
Power to our people, get your smoke on
And I'm so gone, off, that sour diesel
Hard to hold on, but hold on, it's like I'm Pretty Toney
With that robe, got terrorist shook, because I'm so bomb
The hood, put, me in position, I'm in the kitchen
With that cook book, the service I'm giving, birds they vision
Not a good look, told ya my nigga, Tical deliver
Hook or crook, lots of asses to kick, wish I had a bigger foot
Yeah, taking it there, hating who care
Y'all stay out my mental, I got killas waiting in here
To get you, as I sharpen my pencils, tear apart instrumentals
Fuck it, y'all niggaz is pussy, so is the dick that sent you
RZA, we done it again, Co-D occassion
Here's to short skirts and Ol' Dirt McGirt, okay, then
Let's get it popping, like it ain't nothing to get it popping
The big and rotten's the city, too good to be forgotten
[Chorus 2X]
[Streetlife]
The rap game won't like me
You can tell that a nigga is shiesty
If I die, my second born'll be like me
Slide dick to your wifey
Never know your baby boy just might be
Quick to rob a jack, he's so icey, stay dressed to kill
From the Hill, never ran, never will
Attitude, like, fuck you still, I see you missing the point
This is not a rap song, you get clapped on
Bullets break the bone, like the joint, call you out your name
Disrespect ya moms, spit on your dame
Go public, then, shit on your fame, you overlooking the fact
Where you from, is where we at
And y'all don't want no, parts, in that that
Caught your verse for sale, but real niggaz don't shoot & tell
We'd rather do the time and rot in the cell
[Carlton Fisk]
The inner outer state, bi-coastal smoker
Inhale, Cali piff with a swift of glaucoma
Black jeans, black Timbs, black Benz roaster
Smoke rise, out the sun roof when I roll up
Verrazano, with no relation to Gravano
Carlo, shots are hollow, still cop a bottle
And pour some out, moment of silence, then I swallow
I'm still alive, and still the sun'll come out tomorrow
Shine shine shine, and grind, cuz it's money on my mind
And I'm moving like my life is on the line
For the bullshit, I really got no time, a full clip
Really gon' let ya niggaz know what's on my mind
When ya getting out of line, have them choppers lit up
You won't need a camera phone to get the picture
Chalk down, tape around, body bag zipped up
Carlo Verrazano, you can call me mister

Woke up in the morning, like ten A.M
Walked passed the Listerine, went straight for the gin
Osama Bin Laden on my chinny chin chin
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, Meth, the mailman!
[Method Man]
Yo, Ghost, let him in!
[Ghostface Killah]
Will you sign, Mr. Ghostface, package for a friend, here
Right by the X, my bad, here's a pen
[Method Man]
Gucci flip flops, I box my way to the kitchen
My keys is missin', my trees is missin'
No more parties, cuz Doc need to listen
[Ghostface Killah]
Cuz something in my closet, go look (he's a pissin')
I cursed this bitch out, we be laid back
[Method Man]
Half a box of cereal gone, my milk's warm
Mad strong, this is John John, pro and con phenomenon
Stretch with a morning yawn, party 'til the break of dawn
Ladies throw your faces on, sing it when the break come on
[Chorus: Method Man (Ghostface Killah)]
Each (meet) son (see)
Boats (suites) dough (beats)
No cat give you these, rap flow triple g's
Meth, Ghost, Killa Beez, you know we ride
[Ghostface Killah]
Wu-Tang, the best rap group of all time
Rush little shotgun, rest around nine
Refrigerator, fish and sweets with no swine
Dirty and Meth guest room with four dimes
And U-G. had a master headache
Him and Genius flew back from, Uganda black, gettin' that cake
Where Divine at? Wine at
Tell a DJ to rewind that, Killa killed it wit a blind back
Dime sack, you know we blew that wit the cognac
Them bowling ball lead head niggaz, we call them pawn yacks
[Method Man]
I say my girl, like to party all the time, Ghost
Spend up my ends, every week, she always crime broke
Thank God it's friday, I just got paid
Feelin' good like I just got laid
The next drink's on me, instead of, oh God, you think O.G
White girls they comin' out, like they Pink on E
So you better get the party started, we get it crunk regardless
We got the 'dro and hypnotic, them kids is puffin' garbage
Is where it's crackin' at, Street is you passin' that?
Mami's is grabbin' ass, Johnny, I'm grabbin' back
You know my habitat, you know my peoples
If you wit me, where you at
There ain't nothin' compared to that, come on!

I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cup, but they ain't shit there
(These cheap muthafuckas be grown ass men
Tight muthafuckas finish your shit then they bounce off with them)
Come back again, drunk off your gin
And when they try to get you for they ends, that's no friend
That's no friend, eh, eh
[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, greedy muthafuckas, always wanna get high
But never wanna buy, first one to come to the party
Last one to leave, man, fuck all that

We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nuttin
You made a brother feel like he was something
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin
Even when the skies were gray
You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby
Never ever give my pussy away and keep it tight aight
And I'ma walk these dogs so we can live
In a fat ass crib with thousands of kids
Word life you don't need a ring to be my wife
Just be there for me I'm a make sure we

Yo mama don't wear no drawers!

Standin on the welfare line, eatin swine
Tryin to look fine, with her stank behind
You can ask the bitch and she'll tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass
[Verse One:]
Are you ready, to face the consenquences and suffer?
I even tell ya momma you ain't shit, motherfucker
Bring it, and let that killer bee kid sting it
And rep-resent, it's like heads up a brick, when I'm swing it
Get lost, I break you off something
I'm pumpin, like a Reebok, with a pump, from the jump and
You was nothin
Bet ya thought ya fuckin clan had ya fuckin back but they was frontin
Smokin dirt blunts and fuckin nasty stunts and
Ya take the naked gun without the bullet, what ya bustin
Get ya ship sunken, fuckin with a drunken
Master disaster at enemy rap functions
[Interlude:]
Huh, just an echo
Yoo-hoo ripin-ripin in the valley
Yoo-hoo ripin-ripin so to bring back
Sweet memories of you
And you can even ask your crew
Betcha bottom dollar that they tell ya fast
Meth-Tical got STYLE with his nasty ass
[Verse Two:]
Who said the Wu-Tang Clan? Was it you or your man?
You wanna point the finger, I'll bring ya
36 chambers, be out, youze in danger
Let me pull ya brain outcha ass with a hanger
Didn't momma not tell ya not to talk to a stranger
Now ya got ya neck, in the noose, of the strangler
Just recline, keep the Meth in mind
I'll even test the knuckle check on the hands of time
What? And I'll be more than glad to bust that ass
All up and down the block, the street, the isle
Whatever, smokin on a Spike Lee joint
Hey I'm Mo' Better, I'm hopin niggaz get the point
Cause they coul never, stop the veteran, word to God
When I'm severin the HEAD of a mental vegetarian
The Method, at the weekend, with a whole lot of credit
The cuties I desire, I be the first to set it
off, flame on like the Human Torch
Fantastic Four for all the fans in the store
You can eat it all and it'll tell ya fast

And still push a whip with a right and left AC

Yo', all you gonna be, wanna be When will you learn?
Wanna be Doc and Meth? Gotta wait ya turn

Allow me to reintroduce -- nah, I don't need it
If you ain't got it since '92, nigga, beat it

I first met you in my cousin's house, a week later

that big girls they don't cry, but they damn sure lie
Look you in the eye, sayin you they only
You and I, til the day we die, said you'd never
leave me lonely, fly tenderoni but you phony
Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I
turn my back you try to fuck my homies, that was then
this is now I got a new friend, ever since
I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
about leavin the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me, now you on
your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin mad ways to trap me, lookin at my girl nasty
Tryin to throw the pussy at me

Find out my mental's based on instrumental

But niggaz is decaf I stick em for the CREAM
check it, just how deep can shit get
Deep as the abyss and brothers is mad fish accept it
In your Cross Colour, clothes you've crossed over
Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Kross
Who da boss? Niggaz get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan
I be hectic, and comin for the head piece protect it
Fuck it, two tears in a bucket, niggaz want the ruckus
Bustin at me bruh, now bust it
Styles, I gets buckwild
Method Man on some shit, pullin niggaz files
I'm sick, insane, crazy, Drivin Miss Daisy
Out her fuckin mind now I got mine I'm Swayze

Is it real son, is it really real son
Let me know it's real son, if it's really real
Something I could feel son, load it up and kill one
Want it raw deal son, if it's really real

And when I was a lil stereo (stereo)
I listened to some champion (champion)
I always wondered (wondered)
Will now I be the numba one? (Tical! hahaha)

And de gargon summary
And any man dat come test me (test me)
Me gwanna lick out dem brains (it's like that)

Brothers want to hang with the Meth bring the rope
the only way you hang is by the neck nigga poke
off the set comin to your projects
Take it as a threat, better yet it's a promise
Comin from a vet on some old Vietnam shit
Nigga you can bet your bottom dollar hey I bomb shit
And it's gonna get even worse word to God
It's the Wu comin through sickin niggaz for they garments
Movin on your left, southpaw em it's the Meth
Came to represent and carve my name in your chest
You can come test realize you're no contest
Son I'm the gun that won that old Wild West
Quick on the draw with my hands on the four
nine three eleven with the rugged rhymes galore
Check it cause I think not when this hip-hops like proper
Rhymes be the proof while I'm drinkin 90 proof
Huh vodka, no OJ, no straw
When you give it to me aiy, give it to me raw
I've learned when you drink Absolut straight it burns
Enough to give my chest hairs a perm
I don't need a chemical blow to pull a hoe
All I need is Chemical Bank to pay da mo'
What, basically that, Meth-Tical, ninety-four style
Word up we be hazardous *car crashing* *horn passing me*
Northern spicy brown mustard hoes
We have to stick you

Nah man, it's not, it's not yo word up

Take a few to give me a edge
My green light shine bright, Kryptonite type
Fully operational, my physical cream
Put the bottles of smoke down, pick up a magazine
Popped it inside the AR-15
Put it aside, round up the regime
While you rely on religion, I hold a nine
on the mission, to pull fire on your opposition
Revelation was the vision of this
Crack the heavens, it's time to bring the business, shit
My story goes back to them lost Pyramids

Why you ain't got no Black Editors?

You don't understand, why you're publically banned

Droppin fast who's next, next to get wet

What kind of party is this, it's that political kind
Where America's best, most hypocritical minds
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind
And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime

I confuse em and use em as tools and slaves
Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations --
I robs the damn nation
so I can live in luxury, you fucks with me
You marryin the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free
I tell the people what they wanna hear
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin
and start back doin dope, cussin and fuckin
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks
That's my style, my pol-i-tricks

I disconnect the phones and the rest
Find a butcherknife
Cut the power lines to the lights
Now a nigga wild for the night
I come like the living death, straight from the dirt
Back to avenge his own death on this earth
Ever heard of Jason, then you know my work
Down to the basement, the dog get it first
I can't help myself, my thoughts ain't my own
The voices in my head just won't leave me alone
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Pissing on the car seats, flattenin' the wheels
So there's no escape from the fate that awaits
No one to witness the horror taking place
Yeah, now I'm on my way up the stairs
To the bedroom on my prey unaware
Heads will be hung from the chimney with care
With hopes that the police soon will be here
I'm a killer!
[Verse Two: Redman]
Yo, yo
Fuck knocking, kick the door, evict the four
Yell out: ""It's a stickup, hit the floor!""
You fish cake niggas, stay Lipton off
Did your mama name you, or Mrs. Paul's
Battle in session, what's up with it?
I talk like I walk with a fucked up pivot
Niggas scream out: ""It's just us bitches!""
Don't shoot, out the phonebooth
I aim at your party, hit the wrong group
""Happy birth..."" ow, ow, ow, ow
Niggas done snap, runnin' hunch back
Ducking, brick walls, get thumbtacked
So run laps, for I body you
Bust out the size, like karate shoes, Doc
Turn velcro, when night falls
Central park joggers, wear bright clothes
Tae bo, five flo's
Lizard, Centipede, Snake
I'm a killer!
Cereal, cereal killer (This is the sound of a cow: Howl)
Cereal, cereal killer
[Verse Three: Redman]
Yo, yo
I walk on backs like Mr. Bentley,
After p-p-p strips you empty
Gather around, for rapid sound
Fourth of July was three months ago, shoulda pad 'em down
No one will fold both thumbs
and eight fingers to square with Joe Young
Tongue below one, spit dumb, moron
For white boys to snowboard on
So whatchu, whatchu, whatchu want?
Chew spearmint gum two double pump
Two cannons, piece by piece
Your school get dazed like G by G
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Take nuts and screws out ferris wheels
If you ain't Missy, payin' no bills
Body, you and supermarket, no thrills
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill
Murda, murda, murda, kill, kill, kill (Cereal, cereal killer)
[Verse Four: Method Man]
Doc hold my coat, I'm 'bout to go low
Titanic MC rock the boat meth
Tone deaf rhyme, microphone sex line
Next time don't forget the TEC-9
Step, Five digital, context is critical
Bomb threat these individiuals thats on deck
So you the illest nigga in Nebraska? Hell naw
It's the master, number sixteen, party crasher, Flex
I think too much, I drink too much
My crew don't really give two fucks, about you ducks
We over here Shaolin
What, spontaneous combust when I smoke a bag of dust
Ahh what a rush, cigar be the dutch
Method Man and Redman, Starsky and Hutch
I crush MC's
Can't trust niggas, niggas can't trust me
I'm a killer!

Depending on any givin' day I'm representin'

Oh yes ya'll, if you got the weed, who got the blunts?
Take a guess ya'll, Kool-Aid bustin' thru the wall

So what we smoke cancer sticks and weed and all that good shit
Fuck the world, word up
Sunz of Man, Method Man,
True Mast', collabora-tion
[Chorus:]
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
Brothers want grub gotta take it in blood
Because is you down or are you down just because
Can't you see my love even though we be with thugs
[Verse One: True Master]
Yo, when you least expect is when we attack, in fact
your format, is not yet suitable for combat
Still dissident factions within the Kingdom
Campaign desperate attempts to take your freedoms
Emphatically, wack strategy, don't impress me
Impulsiveness'll only bring you tragedy, test me
Descent to the essence quickly, niggaz strictly flip
Fuckin with this royal assembly, the Sunz of Man
summon me, Chief Administrator of the Law
True Master in this hardcore Art of War
I explore the depths on conflict and with no pretense
found the best strategy the most impressive defense
So when you rush to attack, it be I to crush your force
and exhaust your whole supply
Don't send for reinforcements, give orders for men to maintain
they respective borders, or it's a God damn slaughter
[Verse Two: Method Man]
Shots in the park, it be on after dark
Hungry like the Wolf when the beef starts to cook
When push come to shove, we push through the club
Pocket full of bud, baby armed with the snub
nosed I suppose, you get body-snatched when you doze
Recognize your friends from your foes
or here lie, another one victimized
Left for The Fly, now what size is this?
Nigga your size, and I would be much obliged
to get a fatter piece of that pie
Still got my Eyes on the Prize, and like Gloria
I will survive, at war with the warrior
Hot with the rhyme.. pennies
Turn the heat up, and bend me
Prepare for the next milleni'
I can't sleep, I'm in the shit knee deep
In a race against time, beat your motherfuckin beat
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice
when we done, and all minds are one, yo
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Prodigal Sunn]
I be the Rabbi watched by snake eyes as the playa hate rise
New York state side to the West side
Fuck the best rhyme, best respect mine, from here
to Palestine watch Sunz of Man climb
I could tell a fake from a handshake for man's sake to hittin truth
I translate til the land quake
I plan my escape on the good fan base
Strictly satisfaction like the Sunz of Man tape
No copy or biting off of what your man make
It's 1998, get your own mindstate
In 1999 write your own platinum rhymes
Can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
Yo, words and keyboards we please the Lord
Lyrics feed the poor, while the rich receive the sore
Couldn't stay in one spot too long, split in fours
Told the truth the four tours brought artists four doors
I rock the concert til my arm hurt, doin God's work
while you Star Search, I take your mind to Mars' dirt
Uhh, what
I said, can you see my love even though we be with thugs?
[Verse Four: Hell Razah]
This mathematical rhythmatical mechanism enhances my wisdom
? of Islam, keeps me calm
from doing you harm, when I attack, it's Vietnam
Through CD-ROM, the mega bomb severs the ice in your charm
Too late for Salaam, slugs rip through your arm
Double lead arm supreme head some fled from the bloodshed
Painting many in red, leavin Iranians dead
? , hangin fast on they deathbed
Out the window, lyrics flow like hot chemicals
Burning competitors, from they ears to they asshole
You wanna battle, I seperate your Adam's Apple
Crack your skully with a Snapple bottle, on the Apollo
Can you read black, ease back, we bleed tracks
Breeze through facts, contacts smack your wolfpack
[Chorus]
[Johnny Blaze]
Hold your satellite Son, I'm from where you from
Same shit different slum, where we about to go
ain't no need for the gun, I treat you to a slice

Fuck 'em like the Earth say
From first day I survey the hassle
Death knockin at your door
In the Big Apple

In the form of emcees determined
To step foot on God soil
Not knowin' that these egg heads come hard boiled
And heavy handed
The aliens they just landed
And you in the way
Overthrow these niggas planet

Homicide buck niggas get the buck with pelets

Snake vs the Crane Style
Death to the enemy, Wu brother number one
The centipede, trouble some
Send 'em all to Kingdom Come
Sun still shine one
Time for your crooked mind
Drunk off of cheap wine
Son I'm in the street crime
Every word, every line
Got juice very fine
Turn me loose on mankind
Detionate the land mine
Funk gets me goin' now
Never sell, never sold
Live by the code now
Never tell, never told
Darts I throw
Like Clyde with the finger roll
Clut shots an what not
This is where the buck stops
Still can't eat and y'all still cant sleep
I eat up my ?self? as presidential emcee
Wu-Tang killa bee
The bee high facility
In love with the blunt smoke
Even though its killin me
Bad vibes fillin me
With thoughts of conspiricy

Too hot to handle
Well put together to dismantle

Shit just don't happen
Gon' fuck around a miss a buck

It's the rap rule again (hehehehe) Yo, yo..

Street, Meth, we ride like A.C. and O.J. (y'all niggaz crazy!)
I runs up on you in broad days, I'm a Loose Link
I carry's the Heaterz, always
Small timers, get left for dead in the hallways
It's that ill breed, move in warp speed, follow my lead
(Me and my Co-D's, about to O.D.) let me procede
I'm that O.G., you're not in my league (you know my steez)
I put the smackdown, on you killer clown M.C.'s

I rock for all my niggaz (I rock for all my niggaz)
That's why I hurt to be here, okay, let me see here
Stat' Land, crooked letter is I, we back, man
Harder than a dick on viagra gettin' a lap dance
Hittin' like a back hand (I slap y'all kids)
As if we in a game of spades, and y'all renig'

Shit, every man fights to stay alive

Stingy with my dough, even stingier with dojia'

Holla for a dollar, yea, and y'all ain't gotta go home

Who stay ""Lo"" like Jennifer, won't see me a lot
But when you see Vivica, tell her she a ""Fox""

We rollin', big truck, sittin' on chrome (twistin' a bone)
Talkin' to a bird on the bat phone
Zonin', out the area, roamin'
The closest you could come to my style, maybe, is clonin'

Run up, watch me put one up in your colon
Chizzle town, thugs in the club, like chicks posin'
Lambchop niggaz is sheep in wolf clothing

Beware, danger, shoot off your flares
Warn all your dogs (tell 'em we here)

Never that, y'all don't come out til the coast is clear

You all thumbs, I probably murder you with your gun
When I start lettin' off (niggaz is jettin' off)
You straight chicken broth, we holes in your terrycloth

Double O, 3, long time no see
Who mind parts seas, and cause blind to see
Some think this industry is just all rhyme and G
Then he make it to the door, and he can't find the key

Or make this pretty thing on her knees swallow my seed

Wipe my ass with the phenonmenyms, be holy

Fam can't dig it, pop goes the wea-sel
You be hidin under your peacoat wit people
I told cops, roll blocks, no props
Fo' pops, Hennesy back and we both shot
That's how we go out, are you the thug type?
To ride down like Hopper from a Bug Life?
Watch the movie, haters tried to eye screw D
Your beef in small claims court, Judge Judy
When you and I meet up, the fight heat up
Bloody up ya wife beater then light weed up
[Chorus]
[Method Man]
I melt wax, Cuban Link chain react
Breezin through these tracks wit the highest of velocity
Play me like Monopoly
Pay me everytime you trespass on my property
I'm Dick Dastardly, no use in cop blockin me
Sloppily, your woman on the stop-watch clockin me
Possibly I rock well, somebody always watchin me
Livin in the street life, my eyes seen atrocity
Undress a kid properly
When I keeps it movin that means there ain't no stoppin me
Constant motivation, the god fiend bury kings
Proper education, Allah sees everything
How High, just another form of elevation
That's why I choose to build from the basement
Twelve-thirty-one-ninety-nine, times are wastin
More these Hot Dog MC's next to Nathan
Allah Math, break the phonograph in half
Promoters on some bullshit, short wit Johhny cash
(Dat's dat shit) They got snitches rattin on the click
(Dat's dat shit) They got bitches fightin over dick
WHERE THE LOVE AT, when you're young, broke and black
It's over there, in the ashtray, who got a match?
[Chorus]
[Young Zee]
Yeah yeah yeah, Young Zee got bitches fightin over dick
[Redman]
Get ya up and get ya high
Funk Doc got bitches fightin over dick
[Method Man]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Meth-Tical got bitches fightin over dick

Get ya up and get ya high (All y'all stupid bitches keep fightin over dick)
Get ya stoned and get ya wide
Get ya up and get ya high (HIIIIIGH!)
Get ya stoned and get ya wide wide (Yeah yeah)
Get ya stoned and get ya high (Fightin over dick)

I'm drunk and crunk so don't come in my direction
I'm ready to thump, and get the whole crew arrested
Bail 'em out, and laugh about it in Texas, yo
And get with Rome, down in Caki-Lac
And hit the spot, in the hood where the happenings at
Where the shootin' and the fightings and the stabbings at
Where the Lincolns and the Chevys and the Cadi's at, shit

Fucking with this style, the outcome: get physical

Don't forget them aid essentials, vitamins & minerals

If you don't stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything

While my whole platoon rocks the basement

I Einstein these rymes, spit these thangs to prove it
Cross with the mac, in fact my games are truest
Now im on the highway, doing it my way
With Street the legal, Meth, Roc, and Doc friday
Performin' like the weather was warm
And drop heat on the streets through zero degree storms
And keep the ghetto, pop your metal
Smoke it like a cigarette till ya optic yellow
The addiction, aint no friction
I got them rap heads fillin' out a prescription
With diciton, they in thick, when I put fire to the stakes
And burn the arch, like a iron to your face
These long hard years spent Oxy-Cleanin' - make it clear
Look out! Big 'Sauks is here, hit the button

And ain't tryin' to hear nothin' cuz we had it up to here
(What?)
Lyrics have no dress code (yeah)
From KRS to Depeche Mode
Hit them so cool you cats cold
Had to jump off, it's about to jump off
My niggaz speak with they hands or the gun talk
Yo RZA, we got the Clan in the front and police at the door
Every exit is laced with C-4 about to blow
Life trial I'm passed out
MC's is like bitches in thongs - they assed out
But me, the M-E-T-H- the O-D
Just too real, I can't be touched and can't feel
The monotony in rap, take a picture of my nut sac
Carbon copy that and send your crew a fax
Motherfucker

Turn it up now, y'all done fucked up now

My words is like a third degree to young emcees
Buzzworthy on your MTV, the Killa Bees
John Jacob, straight up, break up, schemes and plots
Ace up my sleeve, bake up pies in pots
So this is what it's come to (Huh?)
Lickin' shots at them kids that used to punk you (Huh?)
Repetitious rap shit, don't get no air play ya mouth whip
And niggaz can't smoke wit' dry lips so chapped
Bite my shit, I'm like Kojack to get my flow back
In fo' flat, I track you down like a low jack
Spy verse spy, eye for an eye can I penalize the uncivilized
Make 'em civilized
You know right from wrong, so know I'm the bomb
Who don't beef for beats, see the tracks on my arm

Spark that shit up
and lets fly
Oh my people
Heyyy Ohhhh
Ahhhh Hooooo
Eiiii Heyyy
[Verse One: Sticky Fingaz]
I'm a hoodlum
A dick in the dirt is what i'm holding
Sporting mad Polo but only if its stolen
I got no morals my mind is in the gutter
KId I'll open up your face with my orange box cutter
Soak you when you least expect it
Before I met Russel I only had a jail record
Plus nothing ever hurt me when I was at home
These Evil Streets got a mind of their own
My Pops left me for dead with just the clothes on my back
I grew up selling crack
And learning to drive a car jack
I got street smarts and I use intuition
I can spot an undercover with my x-ray vision
And if anybody test me out there
They gonna make me kill them and throw away my carear
I'm my Mothers first born, Her last bad seed
[Verse Two: Fredro Star a.k.a. Never]
Its all about the next caper
The cocaine, props and acres
For the sake ah
Snatchin the green paper
Me and my crew roll in the zone of the twilight
The news highlight
When the next shit don't go right
Its so tight its blazing
A nigga squeezed hayz in
got 'em geezing for a runner
Then the plot thickens
On point like Rod Strickland
Clocks ticking
Makes the hardest niggas clicks stop ticking
Hitting they stash
And murdering like and expert
Cover ya tracks
And conceal that dirty shit
[Chorus: Method Man]
This is for the gun Triggers
The noise bringers
This is for the gun slingers
Bell ringers
The bootleggers
And every day bangers
And all my hood hustlers who know where we headin'
[repeat 2X]
[Verse Three: Sonsee]
Its all about the $50,000 cars
Dice games and ice chains
We out of the average niggas price range
Rings and Remy mixed with Henny
Chicks with Fendi sucking disk in the Infinity
This nigga had mad deco
Fucking petro the nickel metro Blow
All you heard was the gun echo
On a dead nbight I get my head right
Running red lights no headlights
Pumping Buddah in a black Benz
Pulling out Mac 10's
Its just the smell of fucking cigarettes
Broke niggas with assed out
Took 2 puffs and passed out
Woke him up with 21 shots of penicillin
amped him up
I guess thought it was hempacillin
Yo chill kid lamp kid, chill kid you livin'
Aye yo JB hit me one time
[Verse Four: Method Man]
Its the Blaze that be Johnny
Not many shots can do that ass raunchy
Lyric to the muzak we rolling
Watch out for the niggas that be holding
Raunchy fucking up your colon
Of course its Tical
Verbal assault
We can walk these dogs through all 5 boroughs of New York
Some talk
While other individuals walk
In my square tryin' to hide thoughts
Spreading lies in my ears
Got me questioning my peers
That be show and prove they don't belong here
I be the Chef in Hells Kitchen
Pop in the clip and hit the DJ if the records skipping
My competition gotta keep me at arms distance
I know myself onion head niggas don't listen
I shoot the what
Got no time for that wiz bitchin'
I'm about to blow in 5 seconds
The clocks ticking consider this another mission
impossible as he gets hostile
Uncut blowing up your nostril
We There
Come on take another if you dare
The reason why its so raw cause its real
I swear by the hairs on my Chin Chiggy Chin
To the day I die I represent the Grimy niggas
The ones who can't afford Tommy Hillfigger
The down and dirty Johnny fill Niggas

Look you in the eye, sayin you they only
You and I, til the day we die, said you'd never

Shoulda listened when my momma told me, soon as I
turn my back you' try to fuck my homies, that was then
this is now I got a new friend, ever since
I cut them loose ends you wanna bone me
Add strife to my life, pussy that'll make me think twice
about leavin the wife even, picture that
You ain't want me when you had me, now you on
your third baby daddy, and you hate to see a nigga happy
So you tryin mad ways to trap me, lookin at my girl nasty
Tryin to throw the pussy at me
""Now look at this bitch over here tryin to act like me""
""Uh-huh, fuck that bitch, she must like leftovers""

Cause I ain't got none left for you, plus you miserable

Look into the eyes, True Lies, your whole click despise
Especially me, H-A-V-O-C
Don't want your chick, cuz she's burning third degree
Plus you snitchin, you ain't got no ties on me
I keep it strong, while you scream word is bond
Lying through your teeth swearing on your first born
Your word is weak, go hold a wake in this
Hit you up quick strictly shit that I'm livin in
You walk a line that's thin, you religious well you sin
Fuckin with the Mobb, Infamous to the end
I hold a nine Ruger, with an infa-spot disc
Red dot right at your face, so set sail or rock it
And kept drivin, pull off like the Indy 5 G
In a four time Ford truck with Speed
like the motion picture, this nigga Gone With the Wind
My crime work, ninja style shit was did
And got away with, escaped it, the Jakes from tracing
Anything that lead to the source, you know the boss
of the Mobb killing, is like an Unsolved Mystery
Puzzling, nobody knows, it's all history
Madness amongst me, I frequently have to get lovely
Never fails it's always something
No rest, daily gotta rock my vest
I shoot at your best man yeah your MVP
He played the front line got struck down immediately
I wave a Mobb Deep flag, you hear the sound as it slaps when
heavy load my military hold ammunition
Far from animation, it's real live, you think not
My crew, changing New York, who taking your spot
I put the green light on, your whole click, Island shit
Running through the hoe-house wilding, extorting
(Extortion, hit that up, extortion, hit that up)
[Verse Two: Havoc, Method]
Extortion is the key I got the key for extortion
Spend your fortune, dead your shorty like abortion
Take precaution, Infamous laws enforced in
You married to the Mobb, kid take it then divorce it
Cause I ain't got no time for them domestic disputes
If you scared get a dog don't got a click then recruit
You're weak troop, lost the tan in the mist
On your name my shit, take it like a man you little bitch
I blaze yo britches, P.L.O. extortion, you forcin
The hand that rocks the cradle, caution before you enter
This Shaolin representer, carry thirty-six deadly shits
You fuckin with, top contenders
Official to the bone gristle
It don't matter if you bust rhymes or bust pistols
Remember me, burn a nigga to a third degree
Don't act familiar motherfuckers you ain't heard of me
Just peep the stee and the rap how it's supposed to be
Tap the pockets bag the goods like a grocery, we food-shoppin
On top of that we hip-hoppin, and don't stoppin
Out-of-state drawers-droppin, the panty-raiders
Slide on ya like gators, umped that stank bitch back out
and then played her, but that ain't nothin
Crossin this dog walkin, native New York and
Shaolin slang talkin, rap nigga
Mr. Freeze crowd shiver
What? Young, black, and don't give a fuck
If the next crew get the scissor...
(Extortion, extortion, give that up kid, extortion)
Bottom line, what the fuck you wanna do
You eyin me, at the same time I'm eyin you, punk
Wanna pop the most junk
Be the same motherfucker with the most lumps

Listen when this hit the ground, y'all gon' hear the difference now

The kid is back, making tracks, catch panic attacks, and fall

Aww shit, ain't this about a bitch
I give a fuck about a bitch, I'm more about a grip
And I'm all that a nigga got, the more he gotta get
Feeling like a million dollars, buyin' million dollar shit (keep back)
What y'all dealing with, one shot killing it
Stop changing my style, when y'all stop stealing it

One bad mooley, and you can get pants, schooly
I'm the G.O.A.T., what I wrote cause fire and smoke
Think I started on the choir singin solo for the pope
Tell your mama please, get up off her knees
You can't wear yellow spandex wit a ass of cottage cheese
Open toed shoes, feet smell like collard greens
Toes *Kriss Krossed* like she on J. Dupris' team
Button your sittin up like beach balls in the sand plus
A mouth full of rotten teeth with a dildo in her hand
Who the fuck let you in, all my assistants are fired
Now I'm lookin for some washed up rapper that I can hire
You know some old school nigga wit a bit of attitude
Pay him $1500 to fuck a girl in an interlude
You say I'm souped up, well, soup is good food
So what I scratch my nuts, how the fuck is that wrong
For so glowin, afro pickin
S-curl hatin, Jamaican rum sippin

[Verse 1: Sticky Fingaz]
Who made black folks slam and throw they guns?
Who made da world bacdafucup in '91?
Who made niggaz go out and shave they head bald?
Who beat Dr Dre for a soul train award?
Who da first rap star u seen dive into da crowd?
Who originated that screamin grimey sound?
Who had da last verse u were always waitin for?
Well he's solo now u aint gotta wait no more?
STICKY FINGAZ! my life is like an action flick
My solo album coming out february da 6th
I got a question whats it all about in here?
I got a question who got da hottest album this year?
I brought everybodys album who came out this year
And I want my money back I got the hottest album this year
Do u know how much universal paid russel simmons to buy me
Even interscope was havin biddin wars tryin to sign me
Do u think its all about da monney nah, nah, its more than that
Its real shit when thug niggaz want ya autograph
There's only 3 hot rappers thats out no lie
Lets see theres me, myself & I
I might flip out & bug once da la gets in me
And go stab a nigga like Ja Rule did fifty
When I rhyme, I put rappers on da spot
Recording in da same studio, 2Pac got shot
Bringing to da game new ideas
I cop more respect than u, I aint dropped an album in 2 years
[Chorus]
Black Trash
Yo kick that old real shit
That green shit
[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Came to change, smoke, provoke da whole shit to bouncin
Announcing ya name to loud might get u shut down
I vitallity cut down after da club close
Wettin up ya sunday clothes, with a snub nose
That's how it goes, Xzibit give a fuck what u thinkin
Everyday for me is a week in a blast of da mohcians
You bastards is tweekin, I came to get some pussy & skate
I never debate, fake featherweights catch a nikel plate
Me & my niggaz seen da moves u feelin mate
And all da bitches seen da dick that they should've ate
We multilate then vacate in da golden state
Home of da place where niggaz usually make there last mistake
So pop ya collars & enjoy ya drinks
Cos u aint tryin to see death & I aint tryin to see da clink
With the flick of a wrist, send you deep into the abyss
I don't pop Cryst', but will pop a nigga with this
[Chorus]
Word Up!
Yeah we takin all ya money
takin all ya bitches
[Verse 3: Method Man & Redman]
Yo Yo Im so hot to def
I'll probably get shot to death
Y'all niggaz wanna rock wit Meth?
Not on ya best day
Stoppin ya breath da M.E.F Way
Lets say we get this off our chest
Let da tec spray
S.I. back up in da joint I must confese I
Burnt down da muthafuckin house before I left I
These ladies on da dance floor showin butt
My niggaz in da bathroom throwin up
Carrying a black shottie walkin up da club
Pick out ya dirtiest crew I can stomp in da mud (Who Want It?)
Cos when I scream when im pumpin a slug
Start airin out da room like im vaccuming up
Doc u know da rukcus gonna get brung tonight
Killa Bees says somebody gonna get stung tonight
Hit me, hit em up, stick me, stick em up

Sniff a whole key
My coke deep
Be my consciouss tellin me it dont make sense
Then guard his nonsense
A niggas best defense is his offense
So yo I watch po po
And duck a dodo
Birdies in them gogo's
Trying to steal my mojo
Oh no your'e fuckin with a pro
Who go for dolo
For sure though
A season veteran holy a (dobo??)
Come on now judge judy
Youre televised through our vision
While I black you get imprisoned
When my eyes see through your eyes
Your hypnotized
Subconsciously you change the station to channel live
That underground hard-core sound who said it'd die
Cause if it is me and my nine's
The first to ride
For my niggas
Live by the fire die by the flame
Happy im gone knowin my son's gonna be the same
As his dough-diggy dog that
Who put his feelings on a pamphlet
A pen unleash the dragon again uh
Im on ya like hot grease on a skillet
Gorillas on real tv because they feel us
[Verse 2]
I'm livin like a hundred in a jeep stolen
Wools in sheeps clothng
All beef frozen
Bust like cheap trojans
Nautrally rollin blunts and weed smokin
We keep chokin
Bitches on they knees open
I spit like a automatic semi barking part
And if you hear me starin blame the remmy martin
So liquor shots ghetto people
Dutches and c-lo's duckin the repo
For fuckin them lady c-o's
Rhymes blind devine (evol??)
Smoked out in the cadillac regal
With a mommy on my beecho
Theres eight million stories
Only six million ways to die
Theres two million niggas getting away with crime
Theres two million more whack niggas tryin to rhyme
Now theres four million niggas tryin to eat at one time
It keeps the thugs gunnin in the blood runnin
And the judge frontin
Enough to make nigga touch something
[Chorus]
Niggas fuckin with that strick-nine
The models get mine
So we gonna be big time
Its ghetto buisness
Niggas jack cars and rap stars
Rockin the cash bars
Bitches dancin naked on their lap
Its ghetto buisness
Niggas hold guns
Hot ones steakin' the biscut
Ghetto nigga soft cores is ghetto business
Yo, drinks and weed son
Never seeds son
I got what you need son
Its all ghetto business
[Verse 3]
Yo this is for the senile
Walking on the green mile
My lyrics be like the spirit of a teen gone wild
Shit is after ten bitch wheres your child
With a nine in his pocket lockin it down like penile
I did the knowledge to born
Your style straight corn
I woke up in the morning
Heard your shit and just yawned
You fuckin up my high
No lie
You can die
??
Before i break you up like god
Yo its the herb slinger
New style bringer
Rap is for my war plan
Fat like Corporal Clinger
We still bring the hardcore with r&b singers
While the beast ask you out like hoes on Jerry Springer
[Verse 4]
Yo rally hot boys feel so sick
And I won't stop 'til I'm so so rich
While Y'all niggas spit
I (WHOOO) blow hits
Don't waste time
And I don't waste rhymes
Few minutes, shit
Track done like swiss
If you ain't hot come like this
Real niggas hold a gun like this
Pop something, one in your leg
Make your ass run like this
Now picture that
Defeat rhymes never that
Son son you brave
You ain't a man cause you got a little something to shade
I've been a thug since the sixth grade
Rockin a fade
Young Boomy
Look what the ghetto done to me
Made you bolder now
Heart colder now
Brick soldier now
Gun holder now
Nigga snath my chain, catch him hold him down
Hit him with the hot slugs like over now
I know you wanna test rock, what you waitin for
I live one-thirty-eight basement door
City up north you can't escape the raw
Find me where channel live be at
(What is this)
Ghetto Business

You aint fin to blow up shit
Youre merely a bomb threat
How the fuck you gonna move a crowd
You aint moved out from your moms yet
I'm a vet, better yet a vet-er-an
The words smith and wessun
Like megatron
Understand I'm past hip-hop
I should be put into tiny ziplocks
Distributed by those who flip rocks
Leak use after word Smith b
So dope you better sniff me
And learn to keep me out ya mouth
Get me
I'm goin to Armaghetto swiftly
My whole click be sickly
So we don't sleep we spit in bed
Those thats trying to get hit in the head
Fuck around and get hit in the head
Everything I write is either a death sentence or a blood line
For those who love nines
We don't stand in club lines
We V.I.P

If you ain't down with ghetto business
THERE'S THE EXIT PUNK, HIT THAT !

Tipping these tricks, dripping for pay
And knowing half them bitches is gay

Y'all niggaz ain't crazy for real

Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to YOU
[Verse One: Genius]
I'm deep down in the back streets - in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys - for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crashin of Dow Jones stock
I had to connect to cross seals, to catch more mil's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park, settin up a deal over blunt fire
Bum niggaz sleepin on the bench, they had em wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got Vamp
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame, like Pan Am flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn, the
kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block, and played look-out
For playing predator with a glock, he should have took out
[Chorus:]
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clip that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to YOU
The fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload,
Product must be sold to YOU
[Verse Two: Genius]
It's mandatory that
I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes, and spread em out like crops on a farm
to get CREAM, sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates and other niggaz
plant bombs til the smoke from the blast becomes thick
and flows through all they knew, he's gun sick
His glock clicks, like high-heeled shoes on parquay floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shoveling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and next extort
some import, catchin ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad rooms
She died, and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organized crime and drug wars
[Chorus:]
The fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to YOU
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload

Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time

When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...

So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin

Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that asss shakin

Show & A.G. got the flavas (the flavas)

[D. Flow]
Hey yo no question I'm the best in this rap business
No doubt I'm strapped, get back or get clapped rediculous son
I'm flippin this one (don't be dumb)
You better run or end up like my last victim
Shit that's real I already been through
Scared from the threats I sent you (it's all in the mental)
Jackin niggas like I'm in the Central
Cuttin through that ass like a Ginsu as I commense to
Get big with my nigs, A.G. & Showbiz
Now your idol was doin vital damage to your ribs
Word straight up and down, crab MCs get crushed
I'll leave your style cramped, my crew can't be touched
So when you hear the bomb you know it's D. Flow son
No one can fuck around, yeah that's right (no one)
[Wali World]
Hey yo the honies on the dilz cause I play ball good (it's all good)
I'm still representin the hood
Big shouts to Uncle Pete, you're my number one neighbor
No doubt I'm puffin later with my nigga Gary Aida
Peace to Roc Raider and all the goodfellas
People gettin jealous, well it's the brothers (the brothers)
On some other shit can't forget Shabazz
Representin not to mention that I'm gettin cash
Get with that or get with this because I'm kickin this
With the styles I'm runnin through niggas like Emmit Smith
[Party Arty]
Touchdown, I buck down MCs that step up
10 G's if you wanna MC wrecked up
The ghetto dwella's in your hood, hoodie down
Stomps from the Bronx, the boogie man from the Boogie Down
Momma never told me there would be days like this
That I'd be rippin tracks, gettin paid with my nigs
On tour, roar with that hardcore stuff
Niggas call bluffs (I give em no chance) I make it more rough
(And even slow dance) on niggas faces, rugged, fuck it
Them niggas got to love it cause we made this
I'm gettin papers with my peeps
As Party Arty keeps Bacardi so MCs meet the shotty
[A.G.]
Check the method but don't sweat the technique
Even made the baddest dime bitches get weak when the vets speak
(Hopin) That your head meets my bed sheets
(Now you're open) Like the Red Sea cause I'm potent
Don't fit Don't force it, Flow got that 4-fifth
Who do with that voodoo, my doll it's that cordless
All this and that and then some
Get paid to put raps on tracks, I guess that's my income
The beat chills so they be comin back for refills
(My man shows his street skills) From here to the Peekskills
Kill the rumors, givin MCs brain tumors
Time to step off the set, gotta jet like Puma
[Chorus (2x)]
[Method Man]
What the blood clot, son lick a shot, show your love in the area
Forget me not, mass hysteria
My style revolves around blunts, the Methical
The one and only piece original, never phony
One love to my muthafucker A.G.
A true giant in the industry, hold your shoes up
(Word to God, youknowI'msayin)
Yeah, that's how it's goin down, you know who got the flava
We got the flava, the flava
So bring it on, so bring it on, all you muthafuckin corns, yeah

I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the County or the State see me
it's gonna be in a bag
UHH!  This is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!
[Method Man]
Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
from the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, snatch yo' ass
out that S-Class for fakin, forty-fo' blast
is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
for the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
from the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
to be here, and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
for deceased peers, holdin fort
Police line 'Do Not Cross', they found his corpse
in the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime Method, add another
killer verse to the murder record, the Grand Finale
[Lennox speaking - movie dialogue]
Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun
[Nas Escobar]
Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, lick a poem
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
in the stomach, he robbin niggaz who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the Group Home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those  Go and see
shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
but, dawgs are friends, if one see the morgue, one'll live
to get revenge, and we ride to the end
Bravehearts blow the lye with Henn, and still rise
Took alive with live men, my man got three six-to-eighteen's
and only five in, the Belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggaz from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh
[Chorus: Ja Rule (repeat 2X)]
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggaz! (we dawgs for life)
[DMX and Lakid {dialogue}]
There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here
What you tryin to get it  (Word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it  (Tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you
[DMX]
Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggaz that don't know me see me and think I'ma rob em
Niggaz that know me well see me and think I'ma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'ma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on  That's D
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
one more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over!  This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground, I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga...
[HOOK: Paulissa Morgan]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
[Meth]
Ha, holla cross from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since stocks in Clark Wallabees [ZZZH]
African killers bees black watch (black watch)
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts [ZZZH]
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill [BLBLBH!]
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill (BOOM!)
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom (BOOM!)
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse (3, 2, 1...)
[U-God]
I'm the kid with the golden arms
[Meth]
And I'm the motherfuckin hott nikks (AAAAH!) pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month [COUGH]
Now I'm chokin, smokin, hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin...
Hey kid, (walk straight as a I...)
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough...
Remember what Old Dirty said, I'll fuck yo' ass up!
Now listen
[Meth over hook]
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
As we go...
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
Back, back and forth and forth
As we go...

E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks, rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old
[Raekwon]
Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout
[U-God]
Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, grab the techs and loot this
Executin, shakin all sets, and I'm breakin all hecks
I'm takin all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits...
On the go, check the flow, sayin Wu don't rock shit...
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweatin my pockets
I hear the hot shit

""Dropped outta school early so I could get me some paper
That's a good book,
I don't mind you gettin knowledge about the game
You dig? So you won't have to have those young girls fool ya, you dig?
Trick ya outta your check, so you can learn about it
Don't try to play if you ain't ready for it
Cuz the game could be detrimental to ya boy.""
[Street Life]
I Silver Surf the city circuit, forever lurkin on the street surface
I spit blood for blood verses
Plan span divided, we still stand conquer land
One man'll body slam Def Jam
Focus ya head cam, zoom in, we radio tunin
I know you're listenin so I keep showin and provin
Play the sideline, waitin for the right time to take mine
Street crime, nickel and dime rhyme
f*ck a peace talk, let the gun spark, on the streets of New York
I Shaolin strut through the city asphalt, FED UP
Hold ya head up, I'm circlin the block, keep ya eyes up
Wise up before you get sized up (tied up)
Play no game, speakin on my name you catch a clip full
from close range, diggin in your pocket, take the loose change
[Method Man]
Punch the data in ya mainframe
You want it all, I want the same thing
Strive to maintain, live out my name
Hard to obtain, hard to explain, ain't nuttin changed
Leave the same way I came, Bringin motherf*ckin Pain
[Chorus: Street Life, Method]
Killa Hill projects, hi-tech street intellect
Best connect, blow your headset, f*ck a mic check
Bring em round the underground, pocket full of sound
Ashes to ashes y'all n*ggaz goin down
[Method Man]
Eat sh*t and die slow, battle ground no survival
You goin down, y'all n*ggaz f*ck around
sh*ttin where you sleepin, so my rhyme Proposal came Indecent
Beef from the butcher, sink your teeth in
[Street Life]
f*ck what you believe in, you real-fake
Fishin in the same lake, eatin off the same cake you blow face
[Method Man]
Who go that ready cook, synthetic look, actin crook
Betty shook worm, tryin to shake the hook as the world turn
n*gga burn, once again the Super Sperm, rub it in
your skin, like it's Lubriderm, time took to write this
The war will be fought by the righteous
Who stand criticized by his un A*Alikeness
Knowledge is the truth and it's priceless
Real like them Rahway Lifers, nuttin but time on my hands
Observe the black sands in the hourglass, fallin fast
In the savage land haulin ass, Days of Thunder
It's Road Rage, your days are numbered
What RZA put together let no man tear asunder (motherf*cker!)
[Street Life]
This is P.L.O., Killa Hill flow but you don't hear me though
Live in stereo, pumpin loud until your speaker blow
Ghetty-o slang pro, sling rap for cash flow
Keep it live from the intro until the outro
[Chorus]
[Street Life]
I'm on a suicide run, y'all n*ggaz know the outcome
Razor sharp tongue leave scars in your eardrum
Forty-five bar seminar, ghetto rap star
Slide like water rats through the Staten Reservoir
Swingin swords cut your mic cord, snatch ya rap awards
Commercial cats f*ckin up the game, that's why I crash boards
Break laws, wired jaw, keep on tryin yours
Hardcore, something that my street n*ggaz is dyin for
[Method Man]
Snatch your neck and the dope fiend, Golgo 13
Professionals wit no things, say no more
Check my Dogs at the Reservoir
Gourmet special of the day is n*gga Souflee, pusher gotta pay
And the games people play, John J. back around the way
Fish filet, Mister DJ, turn it up a notch
Hit the replay, for dirt bomb n*ggaz in the P.J.
to Klingon, bring on, the Good Times for Keyon
Hood rhymes that's be-yond ya thinkin
For eons, I've been hear to shine on the black minds
Tell you like the last time, year of the grimy n*gga
Rag time, bad sign, flatline

Yo, light another, and elevate on this one my brother
Respect mine like my baby mother
I shine when it rain, the sky's cryin for all the black youth
that's dyin, I heard he went out clutchin his iron
And in the mist the slugs flyin, one burst
he kissed the dirt, not knowin he was touched at first
or badly hurt, it's all science, another nigga merked
Kid snatched his purse and his work, left nuttin
but the shells on the turf, the situation's worse
A lot of bitch ass niggaz is comin out they skirts
cause it's real, not everyone can rhyme and get a deal
Not everyone can shine and make a meal
So Johnny carry nine in the steel, one in the head
for all them fuckheads, leave that ass for dead nuff said
Don't be mistaken, or mislead, it's all peace
But when my baby's gotta get fed, I'm all teeth
Bitin DOWN on the bullet now, bloodshed
I cop my herb from a knotty dread, and live this life
on the edge nigga.. one time for your fuckin-ass mind

You like the voice baby  Ruck is the choice lately
Slap a hoe and then grab a hoe just like
My boys pay me no mind, for the shit I say lately
Then deep down in they heart, they think that nigga Ruck is crazy
Maybe, y'all niggaz should just chill before I fuck you up
I can snuff a duck nigga in the face with the uppercut
What the fuck  Y'all niggaz do it the mic ruin

Affect with the motherfuckin grimy style

Son I used to be a good boy, fat cheeks, little cute kid
Potentially rebellious yet a straight A student
I listened to my elders til I found out they was stupid
What they told me had me broke and bummy, time for some new shit
Now, I hold mo' concealed Heat than Acapulco
Ricans in Bushwick call me Rocko, el mano loco
Got a fo'-fo' to make thugs sing like K-Ci and JoJo
Packin ever since Mamma Rock said gunz was a no-no
We don't need those doe, street cats don't need gats
Six-five, from the NBA, many niggaz be that
So try me, like Mutumbo you can't get shit by me
Send you to E.R. son with broke ankles like Allen Ivey.. hehe
hold that thought for a minute
And watch your shorty before I run up in it I admit it
I'm like Sprite, image got you shaken, thinkin I'm Jamaican
But it's thirst that'll get your jewelry and dough taken
FUCK Batman and Robin, I'm robbin with a bat man
Chase niggaz like Chevy for makin wack jams
Hit hard as a dick after a lapdance, ask any Sean Price
in Alcatraz fan, they'll tell you watch the jabbin

Greetings, earthlings
We have now taken over your radioooo.....
[B-Real]
Goin' straight through the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, i'm comin' through
And if you don't wanna move then i'm comin' right through you
[Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, i'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?
[Chorus:]
[B-Real]
We want it all (want it all!)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor!)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore!)
In the game we take you to war (war!)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
[all]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
[Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train i'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The Monstar again, i'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now i'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk
[LL Cool J]
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (Uhh!)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (Uhhh!)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money?
Or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (Uhh!)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I gettin' lyrical?
Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow
[Chorus]
[Busta Rhymes]
Yo, god bless!!
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off!!
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock!!
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be?
They be the Monstars!!!!!!

[Intro:]
Takin it from the top
Tippy  Tippy
How High....
The Ultimate High....
[Verse One: Method Man]
Scuse me as I kiss the sky
Sing a song of six pence, a pocet full a rye
Who the fuck wanna die for their culture
Stalk the dead body like a vulture
Tical get, HMMM
Blacker than your blackest stallion
Hit your house'n projects
I represent the Shaolin my nigga
Hell yes, Apocalypse now, the gun blow
It be goin down, diggy diggy down diggy down down
[Verse Two: Redman]
While the planets and the stars and the moons collapse
When I raise my trigga finga all yall niggaz hit the decks!
Cause aint no need for that, hustlers and hardcores
Raw to the floor raw like Reservoir Dogs
The Green-Eyed Bandit can't stand it
With more Fruitier Loops then that Toucan Sam Bitch
Plus, the Bombazee got me wild
(Fuckin with us) is a straight suicide
[Verse Three: Method Man]
10 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 Murder 1 lyric at your door
Tical bring it to that ass raw
Breakin all the rules like glass jaws
Nigga, you got to get mine to get yours
Fucka, we dont need no rap tour
Id rather kick the facts and catch you with the rap-ture
More than you bargained for
Tical, that stays open like an all nite store
For real, I keeps it ill like a piece of blue steel
Pointed at your temple with the intent to kill
And end your existance, M-E-T
Aint no use for resistance, H-O-D
[Verse Four: Redman]
I bees the ultimate rush to any nigga on dust
The Egyptian Musk use to have me pull mad sluts
I shift like a clutch with the Ruck
Examine my nuts, I dont stop till I get enough
Your shit broke down, light your flare
Since the darkside tears you into hollywood squares
6 million ways to die, so I chose
Made it 6 million and 1 with your eyes closed
The blindfold, cold, so you can feel the rap
And shatter the glass and second half on your monkey ass
And yo my man (Tical) hit me now
Bitches use to play me now they cant forget me now
Forget me not, I rock the spot, check glock
Empty off a lickin off a hip hop
Fuck the billboard, Im a bullet on my block
How you dope when you payed for your billboard spot
[Chorus:]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
It's the funk doctor spock smokin buddha on a train
HOW HIGH So high that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So sick that you can suck my dick
Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane
Recognize, Johnny Blaze, ain't a damn thing changed
HOW HIGH So High that I can kiss the sky
HOW SICK So Sick that you can suck my dick
[Verse Five: Method Man]
Til my man Raider Ruckus come home
It ain't really on till the Ruckus get, home
Puff a meth bone, now I'm off to the red zone
We dont need yo dirt, we, we got our fuckin own
Check it, I brings havoc with my hectic
Bring the Pain lyrics screamin for the antiseptic
Movin on your left kid, and I'm methted, out my fuckin dome piece
Plus I got no love for the beast
Hailin from the big East Coast
Where niggaz pack toast
Home of the drug kingpins and cut throats
(Hey boy, you's the rude boy on the block
You try and stop the bum rush you will get popped)
As I run around with a racist
My style was born in the 50 stair cases
Dig it, eff a rap critic
He talk about it while I live it
If Red got the blunt, Im the second one to hit it
[Verse Six: Redman]
Look up in the, I got the verbs, nouns and glocks in ya
Enter the centa, lyrics bang like rico-chet
Rabbit, I brings havoc with an A-K matic
Rollin blunts an all day habit
I get it on like Smiff and Wess
Who clicks the best
Punks take a sip and test
Who split your vest
The funk phenomenon
Im bombin you like Lebanon
Blow canals of Panama
Just off stamina
Styles not to be fucked with, or played with
Fuck the pretty hoes, I love those Section A Bit-ches
Hittin switches, Twistin wigs with
Fat radical mathematical type scriptures
I dig up in your planets like Diga,
Boo, scared you, blew you to smithe-reens
Fuck the marines, I got machines
To light the spliff, and read Mad magazine
I fly more heads than Continental
Wreck ya 5 times like US AIR off an instrumental
Look I'm not a half way crook with bad looks
But I may murder your case like your name was Cal Brooks
I breaks em up proppa
Ask Biggie Smalls 'Who Shot Ya'
Funk doctor, with the 12 Gauge Mossberg
Look, I got the tools like Rickle
To make your mind tickle
For the nine nickle
(Yo Red, yo Red!)
Punk ass pussy ass

In ya tracks
A Wu-Tang (bzzz) killer bee's on ya back
I comes for the honey plus the phat money sack
You want it all?
Yeah I want it all like THAT
I stab my own moms in the back for a stack
Niggas like damn, why you want it like that?
'Cause I'm a dog, and I got no love for the cat
Attitude's cold like the north polar cap
Where I do my (??) a little further down the map
A little black island
Called Stat
Where niggas carry gats in they Black Moon hat
Now I'm mad known for the bones and the rap
And youse an unknown with a phoney contract
Wake up and smell the method, motherfucker
Contact, fallin' in a cypher from a fallen head crack
An indian giver and I'm out to take it back
Shaolin Island, baby where you at?
A runaway train that be runnin' on ya track
That's how it's goin' down
Yeah, it's goin' down like that

To live, to love, to see, to learn

Betcha twenty points and ya still can't score

A home run hitter and you be buntin'
Brush out the toilet, I got my shit together
When I'm good, I'm good,
When bad, I'm better
You want it?
Whatever

Rain coming down
To weather with ya leather

Couldn't
HACK IT
I spark 'em like a match (ssskt)
Coming back it's the method
To get louder
The method
Man, clap yo hands, now check it
See me in the mist (??)
But my physical brother came through and got me lift
Niggas, that I walk by, give me the eye
The mormon is fuckin' me up, killing my high

Ya pussy cat,
I'm fearsome
Basically dat,
I'm all of dat,
And 'den some
While I,
Was out on tour,
Goin' beserk
I heard you
Was over at the sand box
And kickin' DIRT
All over my name
But you can't pull my file,
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, AND YOU DON'T KNOW MY STYLE
Comin' out 'dere like dat 'dere
YEAH,

Standin center stage, closin the show holdin a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hopin it's wack
Niggaz, screamin my name on record straight whylin
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night, and the Mercedes's tight

Pull your shoes up, don't get stuck

You see me spittin at the kitten with the lost mitten
As we engage in cold war gettin frostbitten

in pursuit of gold lines, can a n---a touch it
If I can't see ya can't truss it
A shady character like Buzz Buzzard
Lay him out like a plush rug-ged
*mimicking Brand Nubian* Now you can love it, or leave it alone
We drink death and puff bone
Draggin your body out the end zone
And any way the wind blow that's where you flow
That's why you be the first one caught, last to know
Body layin out on the flo', substitute
Heavy players from the run and shoot, we open do'
Third and long, quarterback pack the cannon on
I go deep he drop bombs, *whistle* that's when I touch-down
Six points, what now
Once again who comin through in the clutch now, perfect strangerous
Ever since I came with this, and wrecked a body
You convinced like Lombardi, that Johnny Dangerous
Offensive shotgun
Calm in the pocket I got one, in the milli gun
Deep threats to chose from, that's how it goes son
You win some you lose some, it's in the game
You win some you lose some (uhh!) that's how it goes son (yeah)

Straight from Fema Island, buckwhylin, I'm stylin
A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
S--t locked down, like my n----z out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your earpiece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
and thrill, lyrics spittin, through my lips
Doin backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Watters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
the rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be  It be I, the n---a with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb (boom!), guard your grill
It's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassvile
Drillin rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff
Another TV, and they loved it

Anarchy, genocide, starvation
Then.. when it seemed like shit couldn't get any more fucked up
We got The Plague
The Living Death
Closing his icy grip around the whole planet
Then the rumors started
The last hardcore MC's.. were working on a cure
.. that would END the pestilence.. why?
I like the death
I *LIKE* the misery
I LIKE THIS WORLD!!!!!
Space, The Final Frontier
These are the voy-voy-voyages of the Starship TICAL
As I walk in the shadow of death
Sixteen men on a dead man's chest
Your host this evening for H-O-T
N-I-S, you get splashed with the Tec
Nobody go, til the God say so
You got a second or mo', to run for the do'
Before I blow back off the map, contact
You didn't know stack, couldn't get down like that
Who want them test rocket launcher, YES
Mr. Meth, hold the fort, most def'
Kids is dead wrong, song's too long
Get swung on, can't we all get along?
See my pinkie, see my thumb
See that kid with the pawn shop gun?
Bust your gums, leave your whole shit numb
Mmmm now what's this? Smell like fish
Mr. Big Mouth, the gat be trout
You need to douche out your style no doubt
Johnny struck through the Shaolin slum
PRUM PRUM PRUM on my Shaolin drum
Niggaz don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playin over here, PLAYA
Only one way, and that's my way
Grim Reaper callin, Judgement Day
(10) Ten let the countdown begin
(9) I was born in the mind
(8) Take the head of a snake
(7) Behold Armaggedeon
(6) Ain't no love for the rich
(5) Only strong will survive
(4) Cause we live by the sword
(3) Plus sixty degrees
(2) For the black and the blue
(1) For the sun.. step into millenium
The name of this one is Judgement Day
No more BS, can't come out and play
Don't blame me, blame society
Type of chemistry for a live MC
Hands in the air like you just don't care
You all get a share, there's a party over here
Year two-thousand, keep bouncin
T-Minus, thirty seconds and countin
New York's finest, still wildin, Shaolin
At the full moon howlin
Get Til It's Gone, killa bee kills
Only time will reveal like the words in the song
Cause love's what I feel for my crew, bust steel
Niggaz don't got to pay my bills
P.L.O. pack the slingshot flow
Plant the seed, let the garden grow
And stick that rhyme where the sun don't shine
Darts pierce your heart like a Valentine
Tis my Tale From the Crypt that's sick
Bloodbath, body baths and shit
U-F-C fightin championships
G.I. Joe's with the Kung-Fu Grip
Now you don't dare, to step in the square
Kids ain't playin over here, PLAYA
Only one way, and that's my way

Good news Hip-Hoppers
The big alert has been called off
It turns out that the early reports were wrong,
ALL wrong
Now for that clan out there that had such a tough time gettin home
Sorry bout that!
I guess the only thing we can do, is play you a song
Yeah, do that, uh-huh uh uh, UH
Yes what what what, what what what, what?
What what what, what what what, UH
Yea yea yea (if you don't, lay back)
Raider Ruckus (you catch a lazy jack) Carlton Fisk
(Yaknahmean) Huh, one.. two.. (Shaolin What?)
Shoes full of dirt, kickin sand on your works
Something gotta hurt, catch a case off a verse
Live in concert, kids comin out they shirts
I'm hyped now, jumpin in the crowd feet first
Meant it when i said it, lungs Bring the Pain son
without the anesthetic, make em look pathetic
needin help from paramedic, Hot with the Nickle
Bust back, take em wit you
Survival of the Fittest, and the world out to get us
I feel it in my bones, I can feel it
in my testosterone, when it's on
Stat', bring it back, hard rap for you pussy-cat
Cognac off the meat rack, where the pussy at?
Johnny, got these n*ggaz mad at they mommy
Jumping on my hard salami, say what you like
In the Heat of the Night, I crash individuals
Splash on the mic, air-tight with the lyrical
[Chorus: Method]
(n*gga run with it, have fun with it
load your gun with it, and be done with it)
Welcome to the Killin' Field, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie n*ggaz, goin thru changes
[Method Man]
It all starts with the pad and pen, my special blend
of herbs and spices on mic divices, murder men
Make em mices, I recommend, somethin that's priceless
For you rap hooligans, claimin you nicest
Call it what you like kid, you can even call
a psychic for all I care, still ain't got a prayer
amongst the righteous, Blazini, cheat death like Houdini
Word to bad bird that f*cked nerds in bikinis
Ob-serve, lyrical flows you being served from the gizzard
Pluckin your nerves with nouns and verbs
From the ghettoes to the suburbs, I must be heard
n*ggaz get what n*ggaz deserve
You can put that on my Clan logo, Wu-Tang group for solo
Bloody up my next promo
With the blood of the next bozo, clown @ss n*ggaz be loco
Puffin on lye, cuckoo for cocoa
[Chorus]
Yo yo, sh*t be hot in the kettlepot, Twisted Metal
bust shots til the beef settle, forget me not
City nights get a n*gga hyped, scar his life
Send him back, now he Poltergeist, ghost!
Tell him, who the number one rap most, huh?
Verbal overdose leave him comatose, huh?
The n*gga with the golden throat is out to get you, Hot Nickle
Bust back and take em wit you, eye for eye
Never lie, crossin my heart, hopin you die
Somebody pat the engineer down, I think he wired
I'm off the meat rack, quick to react, my n*ggaz need that
They need gas, cockin heat back, be out like Freejack
The heat's on, you think one-eight, and Johnny's blamed
Who that n*gga, burn biscuit and spit flame
Leave no witness, in the fast lane with shady b*tches
that only want me for my riches, I know your steez
Terror Fabulous, caution, biohazardous degrees
from this ravenous, emcees be yappin
Meth be the co-captain, on Def Jams that's closed captioned
for hearing impaired, they get a share, now what's happenin?
Money to share, that's why we're here
and you actin like we can't eat, like y'all eat
Now we scrappin, out in the street, I know your crew's
hardheaded motherf*ckers and I'm just like you
[Chorus]
Welcome to the Killin' Field, with Johnny Dangerous
Headbanger Boogie n*ggaz, goin thru changes
[Method Man]
I been in the ghetto all my life
I swore to take that b*tch for better or for worse
YouknowhatI'msayin, that's for life n*gga, y'know?

""Konichiwa bitches""

What up, what up, these niggaz suck
They can't hold a fort, better hold that thought, B.
If I can't get it off, see my attitude is MSG
Fuck it, I'm salty, the game been loss me
Pay ya dues, it cost me, who acting like I'm past my prime
Hey Carlton Fisk, nigga, pass the nine, who wanna cross me, now?
And put my body in the lost and found
You with the business, then bust off a round
It's like the passions of Christ, get crucified just for having that ice
And the audacity for having that life, while niggaz starving & shit
The main reason they be robbing and shit
The same reason you've been targeted bitch (these niggaz must of forgot)
The thin line between a hoe and a trick
Give 'em the clip between the four and the fifth (yea, motherfucker I'm high)
There I go again, blowing a spliff
When I exhale, it's like I'm blowing a kiss (konichiwa bitches)
[Chorus: Method Man]
N.Y.C., is all I see
O.D.B., nigga, R.I.P. (konichiwa bitches)
This Killa Beez on ya M.I.C.
You want it all, well then y'all like me (konichiwa bitches)
Come on, come on, I think they playing my song
I came to blow them out the frame, and I'm gone (konichiwa bitches)
M-E-T, to the H-O-D
Why motherfuckers wanna hate on me? (konichiwa bitches)
[Method Man]
For every rhyme, there's a hair on my chest
Scared of the Man, you should be scared of the Meth
Now every damn that I drop, is homicidal, that could dare to be done
There's no survival, now who care to be next? (if you don't know me by now)
Know where the borough is, doing it for
The most thoroughest, you doing the most, pa
The French call it ""forpa"" when fucking with son, the odds a hundred to none
Too many flavors, y'all ain't fucking with one
It's getting deep, see the plot thicker
No place to be, if you bi-atch, nigga
Outside the Clan, we always got RZA
I put it down, like I don't give a
One in the head, I bet he don't get up, we drinking malt liquor
Out of your Benz, just to talk slicker
Then paint a scene that you can all picture
You going in? Well, let me walk with cha
It's Method Man, but for short Mr., Mef (konichiwa bitches)

Awww shit! Ya know the name
Who flip flows like chessboards, there go the games
I'm drugs to the brain
Even on the 14th of February I ain't got no love for Elaine
Back doin' my thang, right
Livin' the fast life
Bitch grab a seat at the bar, get you some act right
If that don't do it then rock, lets bring it back like
""Damn right everybody get some act right""
Ever since I came up, rappers done changed up
Put your walking shoes back on and step your game up
I'm getting through off the books, rock we banked up
Y'all don't think my shit off the hook, then yall can hang on
I'm like a king that's so fresh so clean
I leave niggaz like black coffee, no cream
Come inside the party fuck up the whole scene
""That's right everybody get some act right""
[Hook]
Get up get up, ya know what we came here for
What up what up, get your asses out on the floor
Come on come on, I've been away for far too long
Guess who's back and far too strong for ya niggaz (now)
We feelin' good tonight, we hittin' 'dro like
We gettin money and gettin' honeys that flow like
My mic, my clothes, my life, my dough
""Thats right everybody get some act right""
Ya damned if you do, ya damned if you don't
Step inside my Range and get blammed if you won't
My Clan in the joint, man we got it locked
Like whatever niggaz got in the bank, I got it stopped
Y'all already know of my strength already growin'
And this game many may come but few are chosen
I don't usually do this, but keep the party going like
""Damn right everybody get some act right""
I get tips from BIG and Pac when they blastin' the heat
If you's a rapper, don't ever ride the passenger seat
One to grow on
When up shit's creek, you get your roll on
Boy I never stop, I go on, so on and so on
Rappers can't fuck with me
My career's like somebody put glue in your chair and now your stuck with me
I don't use pick up lines, I guess I'm just picky
""That's right everybody get some act right""
[Hook]
Extra extra read all about it
Who shits they grounded, flies all around it
My trees don't doubt it, they green as a salad
All American Express I never leave home without it
I'll never go pop, Meth Man I'm bout it
Whenever I rock, the jam's over crowded
I'm never gonna stop, the fans won't allow it
""Damn right everybody get some act right""
Yo, get it you got it, if you got it then good
""There's a lot of rappers rappin' but not a lot of 'em could""
I'm that boy in the hood that told Red Riding Hood
There ain't nothin but wars in my neck of the woods
So! Who's ready for MC Whoa
What's beef? Beef is what I got teeth for
I eat up everything on my plate then eat yours like
""That's right everybody get some act right""
[Hook]
""Stand up! Staten Island, Lond Island get some act right
Every borough, New Jersey get some act right
Each state, west coast, east coast, dirty south, midwest get some act right

There go the apple of my eye, my black butterfly

You do with brother's lies, about they baby mothers & they wives
And how you need they ass to survive
I ain't a bit suprised, and I ain't try'nna give you bad vibes
You probably had a bumpy last ride witch ex
Was he stalking, calling making threats where you rest
Until you got that order of protect
Girl, I'm far from a threat, boo, now hold for a sec.
Relax with the Meth, take a load off your breast
If you had a choice, baby, who would you choose
Them dudes who look like they got sugar in they shoes
Girl, that's how you lose
Before you play the game, know the rules
Cuz still ain't nothing changed but the jewels
You still paying dues, when we should be laying on the cruise
Some icecubes, playing with ya boobs, knawmean

Let's ride, we get it everyday, it's doesn't fail
And I always wanna know how you feel
Cuz you're everything, I'm always there for you
Yes, I'll be there, so let's ride

I keep it G, like they do it in the hood, and
You give me everything, and always be right there
And if you real, then let's ride

Hey, pretty ma, you look sweat, I mean
You the type of treat, I've been dying to eat
I see them other dudes try'nna speak, flossin' them jeeps
They wanna whistle & beep when you crossin' the street
Have mercy, to these big hands and big feet
Use me once and use me again like fish grease
Body perfect, primadonna, oh my god, mommy, work it
Make a nigga wanna get a job
I love chicks to hate staring, hate man sharing
Hate it when a bum bitch is wearing what she wearing
Huge attitude like the size of her badunk
Double XL, she the ""Eye Candy of the Month""
Johnny, but ladies call me Big John Studd
Is it my big club or my big long hugs
Go figure, if you got an itch, I'm ya nigga
To scratch it, and bring the hook back while I'm at it, now pass it

Let's ride, I start up on your right
Peace and then we'll fight
I'm starting to fall for love

Yeah, Okay, Yeah,
Back for another one bitch,
Let's go, Ha,
Staten Island stand up,
Strong Island stand up,
Yeah, Brick City nigga,
Funk Doc.
[Method Man]
Yo, I'll start this rhyme with how yall feel in this bitch,
I'm fiendin to spit, Got steel in my grip,
But I aint talkin bout guns, I'm talkin mics, Niggas stealin my shit,
Then try to act like they aint feelin my shit,
Down for talkin bout one, Fuck your feelings, I be talkin in tongues,
Fuck where you from and all the niggas you brung,
Punk, My clan don't sleep son, I put that on each one,
Be cool until the heat, Call me pussy might eat some,
Nigga this is not pop music, Unless your tryna pop shots to it,
Why would you have that glock and not use it,
How could you hear this joint and not lose it,
You stupid, You need to shot from cupid to get love for this music,
Diamond in the ruff, Like iodine, Find me in the cut,
If not prolly find me in a slut, If I buy me a Dutch,
That means Mef Mans, Back with the stuff, Lot of back talkin backin it up.
[Chorus 2X: Method Man]
Now I like bein a man, I like weed in my hand,
I like my cheese in advance, But yall don't understand,
Me no like, Fake niggas that aint got the game tight,
Me no like, When yall killas pop shit and can't fight.
[Method Man]
Back in the zone, No backbone,
He stepped on and spat on, Niggas don't last long,
If I don't get some act-right soon, I'm gonna act wrong,
I aint tryin to get clapped on for makin these rap songs,
If your misunderstood Pink, What would the hood think,
To know that I've been Swindled, Bamboozled, and Hoodwinked,
These rappers aint like me, They see that there might be,
More to me then some Air Force Ones and a white tee,
I'm nice B, 6 foot 4, Un-cut raw,
Pocket full of straws, I'm that nigga to look for,
One paper like a book store, Aint never been shook poor,
I switch from Method Man to Candy Man and the hooked off,
Still aint nothin sweet though, Who wanna spit flows,
First learn to put the weed inside the bag and then get dough, (Then get dough mothafucka)
Tell your peoples and kin folk, I been dope, Anything else is an insult. (God damnit)
[Chorus]
[Method Man]
So obnoxious that I'm toxic, Call it diabetes, Spit that hot shit,
Cause I'm hot bitch, And got butter-fingers, Opps I drops it,
Load and lops it, Take the recipe that’s been concocted,
Got women just like a vehicle, Topless,
Look first, You'll see what I'm worth, Pullin paper straight out the wood work,
Until I push dirt, Shit I hate to fuck up a good shirt,
But damnit I'm back, I can relax, Shot a dos of some murder I wrote, Then lean back,
I'm part Ghost, Part Cappa, RZA, And Deck,
Part Dirty, Uey, GZA, Masta Killa, And Chef,
But I'm all Mef, All vet, Killers I'm complex,
Niggas, Have yet to blow up, Nothin but bomb threats,
New York yall, Shoot or shank me, I bleed Yankee,
I'm hot dog, Yall aint nathan to put it frankly,
I find excuses to finally lose, Then write exclusives,
And eat like VH1, You know behind the music.

If you want to fight, fight with me!
One to one! Man to man!
Get ready to gel team!
Live and direct from the one-six-ooh
We got Tical, pow! Raekwon the Chef, Tical!
It's about to go on, Tical!
You make the call, I make the call!

(count my shells)
And there's about to be one left
(count my shells, nigga)
I know you know it'son kid
(Bring that shit I don't give a fuck!)

[Verse One: Method Man]
Who lit that shit it was I the chinky-eye
Cheeba-hawk from New York, Tical Staten Isle
niggaz thought, that they could walk a dog but they caught
a bad situation, cause I'm a sandwich short
of a picnic, cause you ain't equipped with the sickening
style, blowing up the spot like ballistic
missiles, I be comin through like the four-nine-three-eleven
tearing up the power-u, Me-Tical
A bad motherfucking buddah monk, what the fuck
hit your chest, like cardiac arrest, blow the front
out the frame, hit the pussycat for the pain
of the dog shit, nobody move run your garments
A rugged vet, terrible like a Champion sweat
Wrap a power in a tec, to wet
a nigga up, with all the dangerous diseases
Sniffling sneezing coughing aching stuffy head fever
Fucker, I think it's bout time that you suffer
Bobbin on my nob like an all day sucker
[bell rings] Bitch!
Meth Vs. Chef
(it's my turn) Meth Vs. Chef

(callin me out, it's goin off) I blow your fuckin ass to death
[bell rings]
[Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef]
I'm goin all out kid no turnbacks
You could try to front, get smoked and that's that
Lyric assassin, dressed in black buggin
Sixteen shots to your mug, from a slug then
I go to war in a conrete jungle, make the punt
cause niggaz act funny, and fumble
But I relax, count my shells, a lot of heads gotta fly
Niggaz stay strapped, armed to die
Time for jet-black Tim boot, flowin
Wha-Su God get him, hit em with the nine troop
No question, cha-cha-BLOW in the session
Bloodshot in that direction, cypher
[bell rings]
'Tack you like chess moves best move
Yo, yeah, yo
The boards, your ass
'Tack, 'tack, 'tack, uH! *bell rings*
'Tack the boards like chess moves best move
at Rae through, comin at your motherfuckin crew
Live direct, yeah you better step
Gunshots ring on the set, let's jet
Motivate, to the gate
With some quick high Rae stay fly, and rob your Isle
Airwaves, yo behave

Filthy, dirty like a worm underground
Turn into a crazy early bird, that's my word
Before I kick the bucket I'm a kick 'em to the dirt
Check out the cloud, smoke out from the mouth
Other brothers got mad love () style for the hood, hey
Enter the square if you dare
Without a fro, I'm so raw that I'm real

To see the senorita, with flowers in her hair

Let us milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW
One culture, return of the track slasher
Double doser, Cappadonna broadcaster
Strivin for perfection, the only way I got
my life back was through investin, devotion
Movin my soul toward the skit, vocabulary
comin out my ass like shit, to feed my babies
I gotta fight y'all MC's, this money
be gettin me high just like cheese in these tracks
I milk for all my childhood, make me feel good
So I keep on writin meditatin in the ghetto
Makin love waitin for lost minds to settle
then I speak out, because we all need the guidance
Deep down inside us where you could define science
My mother told me, when I was so stressed out
""All you gotta do is just put your best out""
and I did it, milky
Milk this cow [2X]
Milk this cow, the best way we know how
Park Hill projects, chicka-POW!

Remainin blown nigga, throwin darts at the charts

Yo, new Cappadonna is about to exhale kid
Hold all the phone calls, stop all the mail
Cappadonna raise hell, speak and I broke the shells
Seen brothers that fell when I slipped
I had my alibi tight that night, up in the Hill chillin
y'all'll get shot, move away things are too hot
Look at my spot now, friends are exiled from close distance
I flow persistance, every time I step up, I rip reps up
Ku Klux, my words swing around like numchucks
This ain't for big bucks, never can quit this rap shit
it feeds my seeds, I can barely breathe
But y'all cats better believe keep off, the darts are soft
while I throw these missiles, at your skin tissue
You can't escape I absorb, gigantic crowds all aboard
Watch out for shitty fraud, my darts slam like doors
Makin it hard for you to get yours, selfish
Milk this cow, the best way we know how

Get in the music, you know it like a poet, baby doll

If you don't know, you better, ask somebody who I be
On land, air, or sea, I don't need No I.D
Once again, let's get under their skins like I.V.'s
Or Roman numerals fours (IV's) who we doin' the score
I got a shoe in the door, nothin' new anymore
Ya'll got love for me? I got love for you and yours
Tical Part 0, my friend, rappers is fightin'
Like Tyson, when nothin' else work I'll start bitin'
My shit, and his shit, I'm hopin' it end
I live my life like a lotto ticket, hopin' it win
Purple haze got me chokin' again, open again
I'm what's crackin', like your mamma smokin' again

If you see a model, then you might see me follow
Rubbin' her thighs like Aladdin rub the Genie bottle
Back for another swallow, Method, you know my motto:
""Ya'll might just win today, but I'll be back tomorrow""

Ya'll tryin' to get me started
Who on the short yellow bus tryin' to get retarded?
Kid don't be the artist, formerly known as artist
Jump off a skyscraper, the roof who hit the hardest
Where the bastards at and where they habitats?
I send they asses back to foldin' sweaters at the Gap
I like Nikes, food spicy, I'm a Pisces
That's why women love me and any nigga that's like me
Thoroughbread, I'm with gettin' this dough instead
Need a ho, like I need another hole in the head
Lord help me, I'm crackin' the safe, pocket like 'Face
Mighty Healthy, you know I'm the shit, soon as you smelt me

For what it's worth, the early bird sit at the table and eat first
My niggaz need work, mami buggin', rippin' my t-shirt
We can kick it until our feet hurt
Mothers warn your daughters 'bout this tall drink of water
Spoiler, waiter give her anything she order on the menu
Method Man, live at your venue
Smokin' it, jumpin' off the dick, like he mental
Kid, I got a murder rap, and my head is simple
Open up the pussy, put the lead in the pencils
And people sayin' Wu gon' break up, ya'll

[bees buzzing]

This is... (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
Serious, the craziest
... d-da, (Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream) day-da
Danger, dangerous... style
[Verse One: RZA]
Lyrical shots from the glock
bust bullet holes on the chops, I want the number one spot
With the science, of a giant
New York defiant, brutal like domestic violence
Silence of the Lambs, o-ccured when I slammed in
Foes grab their chairs, to be mad as Ralph Cramden
Others come with shit, as silly as Art Carney
But my Tetley triplizes, more kids than Barney
Never need for stress there's three bags of sess
a damn I rest, playing chess, yes
My thoughts be sneaky like a crook from Brooklyn
When you ain't lookin, I take the queen, with the rook then
I get vexed, layin phat trax on Ampex
Morphous God, gettin drunk, off a Triple X
Violent time, I got more love than valentines
The violent mind, I blast with a silent nine
[Verse Two: Inspector Deck]
My hazardous thoughts to cut the mic's life support short
Brains get stained like tablecloths when I let off
Powerful, poetry pushed past the point of no return
Leavin mics with third-degree burns
Let me at 'em, I cramp your style like a spasm
Track em through the mud then I bag em
We're screaming hardcore, hip-hop drips out my balls
and I be raw, for four score plus seven more
I strike like a bowling ball, holding y'all hostage
like hail, electrifying the third rail
Peep the smash on paragraphs of ruckus
Wu-Tang (Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit)
[Verse Three: Method Man]
Hot time, summer in the city
My people represent, get busy
The heat-seeker, on a mission from hell's kitchen
I gets in where I fits in for head-touchin, listen
Enemy, is the industry got me flippin
I don't give a fuck tell that bitch and a nigga
I'm killin, snipin, catchin murder cases
Desert Storm-in, I be searchin for oasis
As I run a mile with a racist
Pullin, swords, hit the Billboard with a bullet
Peace to the number seven
Everybody else get the fo'-nine-three-eleven
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
I don't know what's going on
if you can take us there...
[Verse Four: Street Thug]
Yo, watch me bang the headpiece there's no survival
My flow lights up the block like a homicidal
murder, underground beef for the burger
P.L.O., criminal thoughts you never heard of
I switch, the city never sleeps, life's a bitch
I shit, runnin through bitches like Emmitt Smith
Caution, niggaz best to be careful crossin
the street, before they end up layin in a coffin
Don't sleep, niggaz tend to forget, however
Peep this -- my nigga Case lives forever
[Verse Five: Carlton Fisk]
What evil lurks in the heart of men?
It be the shadow, street-life, flowin again
I had a plot, scheme, I knew for sure
Only one kid would knock the hinges off the door
The jerk tried to jet, Sabrina at his neck
Thirteen pounds on the table plus a tec
Just when I said, ""Where the fuck's the cream?""
Another jerk came out the kitchen with the M-16
He tried to cock it, blast these shots like, rockets
Crushed his collarbone, ripped his arm out the socket
My move for the table was swift, I got my hostage
(The nigga tried to stab you God!) but I dodged it
Niggaz said, ""Carlton youse a ill motherfucker""
Cause I made it look like they both killed each other
And I'm out
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)
(Mr. Sandman bring me a good dream)

Choked up by the smoke in the charcoal
Lava stamps and brands me like a bar code
I'm bashin all the media strikes
To keep the media dikes
As reinforcements for the fight
And that alone
Will keep John Gotti on the phone (haa haa)
I'm tangled in the zone
I got the bees on the track
Where the fuck you at (Tical!)
Let me hear you pigeons run ya mouth now
(Shut the fuck up!)
I'm pluggin in them social skills
That keep my total bills
Above a million
Last time I checked it
Thank God I'm blessed with a mind that'll wreck it
Wait until the second round and knock em out
[Method Man]
They call me Big John Stud
My middle name Mud
Dirty water flow
Too much for you thug
And can't stand the flood
What up Doc Hold big gun like Elmer Fudd
The sureshot
Mr. Meth I'm unplugged (learn)
Temperatures too hot for sunblock (burn)
Playin wit minds
will get you state time
Locked behind 12 bars from a great mine
Killa bees in the club
Wit his ladybug
Brought a sword to the dance floor
To cut a rug
Love is love all day
Till they throw slugs
And take another life in cold blood
Can't feel me til its your blood
Murder rates tremendous
Crime is endless
Same shit different day
Father forgive us
They know not what they do
All praise is due
Im big like easy
And big bamboo
[Chorus (Meth) 2x]
Whats that, I didn't hear you
(Shut the fuck up)
Come on, a little louder
(Shut the fuck up)
Everybody in together now
(Shut the fuck up)
What huh
(Just shut the fuck up shut the fuck up)
[Meth]
Head strong dead calm
Dead weight to dead wrong
Lets get it on
Twelve rounds
I'll throw down
Wu whole crown
Protect land wit 4 pound
Limp Bizkit
Get around like merry-go
Bust a scenario
Comin through your stereo
Why risk it
Lifestyles of the prolific and gifted
8 essential vitamins and minerals delicious
Word on the street is
They bit my thesis
Knocked out they front teefers
Tryin to taste mine
Actin like they heard it through the grapevine
Dope fiendin for the bassline 2 for 5 rhyme
Pharmacuticals
hard as nails to the cuticles
Where you find that monster she beautiful
Wu Tang and Limp Bizkit roll on the set
Kick a hole in the speaker pull the plug and inject
[Fred Durst]
Mic check
So whats it all about (bout)
And where we gonna run (run)
Maybe we can meet up on the sun
Discretion is advised
For the blood emergin eyes
We limpin on the track with the Method
So get the sunblock (sunblock)
You gettin one shot (haa)
Until you dissolve
I revolve
Around everything you got
From outta nowhere
Prepare
You be blinded by the glare
I told you not to stare
Now you're turned into stone
Without a microphone
But don't you forget you're in a zone
(So shut the fuck up)
And take that shit back
Cuz all your shits wack
(Doo doo is doo doo)
When its weighed out like that
Burnin up your brain like a piston
So all those that didn't listen
Now they even knew what they were missin
And now they even knew the sky was fallin
Down
Wu Tang Clan for the crown
[Chorus 2x]
[Meth]
It was over your head
All day and every day
S I N Y 10304
Wu Tang Killa Bees
And the Limp B-I-Z-K-I-T
Y'all know the time
Y'all know the rhyme
It ain't easy bein greazy in a world full of cleanliness
And, you know, all that other madness
We gone Peace
Limp Bizkit

Rock the house y'all
Bring it on

Yeah... yeah... Allah Math...
Yeah... yo... yo...
[Method Man]
Y'all ain't never stopping the kid, why y'all knocking the king?
Would ya like a shot of liquor or like a shot to the rib?
Plus you stay on top of they grills, stay on top of they biz
Thinking niggaz plotting on hairs, think they not when they is
This is Staten Island gully, you dig? It's getting ugly
And I ain't found a court that can judge me, the block love me
Like nines to the side of the skully, popping they top
I'd rather pop bubbly, one for B.I.G. and one for Pac
Nigga, trust me, I'm hot as they get, like Al Green
Getting hit by a pot of them grits, yo, nahmeen?
Y'all don't really want no parts of this, soon as a nigga
Start shining, niggaz start some shit, my guard lit
Like a boss, head nigga in charge, get in these drawers
Fitted, nine inches bigger than yours
This Meth dude got that food, and he serving it raw
Told you before, I bring the pain, and now I'm hurting them, pa
Hurting them, pa...
[Chorus 2X: Streetlife]
Up from the 36, back on that bullshit
Okay, I'm reloaded, strapped with a full clip
Staten Island's the borough, Park Hill, we still click
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, that's the Clan, we run shit

Aiyo, you fucking with some capital G's, Allah Math
Streetlife, Meth Man, plus the Masta and me
Soldier I, make it happen, indeed, my sick gift
Had the highest paid hoe, get it cracking for free
Worldwide, still trapped in the P's, Pioneers
Like the twenty inch woofers, that's in back of the V
Leave ya brain, like you spazzing on E.
It don't matter who you happen to be, nothing swagger like he
Keep a dirty cop close, never talk with no feds
Tear the roof off the mother, right along with ya head
And I ain't talk unless she talking bout bread
You would swear that I'm rocking New Balance, how I'm walking the ledge
Son, I'm just a little off of the edge, as I stalk
The mean streets, for paused types, callers are read
Killa Hill where the warriors bred, I'm a Resident
Patient, it's gonna take more than the meds
[Chorus 2X]
[Streetlife]
Special invited guest, I came to put the rumors to rest
Rip the rest of the slugs through your chest
Put the chest to the back of your vest
Trap your packet, take the money and jet
Niggaz posted, but you posing no threat
Punk, you pussy like the opposite sex
Front, see how many shots you will get
I'm not asking, I'm demanding respect
I'm just a man to respect
Watch your step, son, your funeral's next
Streetlife is the man in the flesh, I got one hand on your neck
The other hand is attached to the tech
Your next move could mean life or death
Make move, take baby steps
Hold that thought, nigga, save your breath
We hold courts, in the streets, we rep
For Cash Rule, and we came to collect, cock sucker

I traveled so far
Im chewin niggas lyrics for a Mars bar
New era, bust em like reign terror
So highly Mecca Nas a nigga died and measured
The inevitable, beyond the ever so, this deadly technical
Scribes get revised in the time before celestial
No being or lyric ever hit precise, double sight
Take light, through the crypts at night
Spark pathetic brains and meteorite
Seven heaven verses the seven wonder, lyrics of thunder
As lightning strikes snakes out from under
Cloudy men drips, sinks Niles of fine mist
Worries startin to give, land for the tales out the crypt
Of the dark, dead senses, gods of heavenly business
Count Dracula told me how to find the eclipse
I leave your lip stitched
Cause you couldnt mind your business
But when it came to this rap,
You shouldve vacated the premises
Make way for a chilla, guerilla, down low killa
Get loopbtin civil, next up

Yo I believe thats me

P attack you from the metronome
Catch you in your groove home alone
Blowin wit the chrome, nigga
Im blowin to the bone
My title be known, cannibal, dynamical maestro
Sparked and fully hydroed my team of psychos
Sell it higher than the Eifel Towers
Seconds minutes led the hour, wein the power
Spittin bibles, the sunshower, the wise out on the scene
They think we forget the dream
My aura sheens like morphine in your veins
Pastors saying can you and your crew, oooh stand the rain
Many men possess the gin in the jungle of sin
Deeper than, Sunn chosen others frozen
From the explosion, my opposition
Protect my team of demolitions, full competition
Keep em drinkin Benjin
Like some chicken heads on the ground
Bite the trey pound for foes that wanna get down
Me and my clique sharpen the sound
Infiltrate the town town town

If I could chew glass to this, true master shit check it

Hittin ass to this on King Sols mattresses
Bust your gat to this, make sure you hold it accurate
John the Baptist this dip you wit the fish
Aladdin out the genie lamp grant you on your wish
Trapped in the studio booth and told the truth
You better try a video shoot or get the boot
From BK to Beirut we shuttin down groups
Gatherin the loot while you mackin in a chicken coop
Duck duck goose tie him in a noose
Whats the use of havin your troops if you dont put them to use
Yall rappers couldnt blow if a windy storm produce
And sung a kiddie song and wore a Power Ranger suit
Salute the first fruit, King David birth root
Play the earths flute just before I execute

My PLO stees is from here to overseas
Guerillas in the mist swingin from the highest trees
Bombin enemies
See me in the global war being all that I can be
Camoflauge fatigue, hard headed major league
Got em under seige your battleship in sinkin
20,000 leagues beneath sea level
Adjust the trebel on that thang thang got your shovel
Can you dig it Keep talkin bout it while we live it
All day, every days a Billie Holiday
Lady sings the blues get the street news by the way
Have you heard crime pay
Hit your block like that lava that burnt Pompei, mega hot
In the melting pot, felt the shot around the world

Somethin different from that R&B and rap shit

Loyalty brought me royalty
To the Gods I give my heart and soul totally
It's so hard can't be broken, that's my life

Ooooooooh! What a tangled web we weave
When first we practice to decieve
Guns be clickin', runnin' with my clan we be stickin'
Whatever, my street family stays together
Represent what I invent, killa hill
Resident, rest in peace to my nigga Two Cent
The street life is the only life I know
I live by the code style it's mad P.L.O...
Iranian thoughts and cover like an Arabian
Grab a nigga on the spot and put a nine to his cranium
I..can't...get no satisfaction, niggas won't be lastin'
Long, unless they get protaction, for real
Strong, comin' with my clan so what's happenin'
Commercial rap, hate it with a passion
The M-E-T-H-O-D got me drinkin' O.E. all night in a M.P.V.
Just maxin', lookin' for hoes, you know relaxin'
Bitches know the hour it be time for some action
P.L.O., peace to that nigga Barryano
Word up, let's take him to the bridge, Verrazano
[Chorus]

Yo bitches shut all your blinds

Aww shit... not these niggaz again!
Aiyyo listen!
I'm only lettin five of you motherfuckers in here tonight
If your man ain't on the guest list
He get to the BACJ of the fuckin line
And you know another motherfuckin thing?
I don't give a fuck if a bitch spill a drink
in this motherfucker tonight
I'm kickin ALL y'all the fuck outta here
[Method Man]
Uhh
Muh'fuckers be up in the club scared to fuckin death
Nigga if you scared why don't yo' ass just stay the fuck home
Check it out uhh
Me and mines at the door, ain't tryin to pay your fees
Stop playin, you fuckin with me, I push my way in
Bum rush there's plenty of us to tear the club up
Guzzlin Bacardi and such, I split a Dutch
Bouncin nigga lookin like he want war
Now I ain't the one you got to front Pah
Pattin me down like the law
As I stumble in the party
Topsey off the Limon Bacardi for sure
Loungin near the bar section, rolled the L
and kept steppin, concealed weapon, razor sharp
Blue star hatchet, in the sleeve of my jacket
Who that kid, on the dance floor lookin for matches?
Burn somethin, one toke got me blasted
Took another toke then I passed it, choke!
Fantastic, herb ain't no joke
Especially that indo smoke mixed with hashish
Ladies on the dance floor, shakin they asses
Got millon dollar broke niggaz, that makin passes
Honey with the eye glasses, body work is Boombastic
Skin like blackberry molasses, mmmmm
At last it's, time to step and make her mine
Niggas headin toward the bathroom tuckin they shines
Brothers got to keep it movin, playin with kids
that won't hesitate to snatch a Cuban
You know what this is...
(""Yo Duke that's your diamonds right there God?
Yo that shit'll go RIGHT where my people ain't right now..""
""Yo don't touch my shit!"")
Now it's on in the lavatory, I heard a scream
End of story couldn't find shorty, party scene's
now a fucked up chaotic thing, won't be long
before the sirens intervene, the terrotory
Can't we all get along, without the ruckus
Got big bouncin muh'fuckers, tryin to rush us
I can take a hint, what? Can smell the stench
of a hell bent environment, the odds against us
Back to the wall y'all, refuse to fall
All hands on deck yes, prepare to brawl
Uhh, every time I try to have a good time why?
Somebody always fuckin it up, killin my high, damn
Monkey wrench they whole program, party over
By that time I'm dead sober
In the midst of this whole shit fo' soldiers, dead gone
You can tell that they was heat holders
Everybody hit the deck when they expose tech, I fled the set
Bitch slipped and caught a broke neck, some Brooklyn kids
rushed the coat check, they whole set, stompin Duke
half to death and took his Rolex, it's horrible
Like a front page

First, they dropped the bomb
Then came the disease
Then death
This our world
Your world, my world
I like this world!
Yo, on foreign land keep your toast up, hot rocks
Catch a close up your snot box, broke up
Land shark, tryin to post up, reptiles
Trying to throw cub with crooked smiles
Take your kindness for weakness, yhey foul
New York niggas be lovin how the gun talk, POW!
Another underboss pull a doublecross
Niggas ain't ready for the holocaust here and now
Want them games people play, catch these bullets over Broadway
Twenty-five to life up in Rahway get caught
Look deep into the black thought, a holy war is being fought
on Allah's court, my perfect world (if you will)
Mr. Sandman, bring 'em a dream, infa-red light beams
Homicide scene, perfect world
By any means get cream
Just don't let it come between you and I, seen
Everything is everything in this three ringed, circus
Peoples is swift, tryin to work us, lord
with devil worship and satanic verses
It takes place in the world, perfect, mine and yours
Heard when it rains, it pours
I came to bring the pain once more (once more)
Pedal to the floor, peep the Jim Crow law
The Big Apple, rotten to the core
These niggaz want war? (GIVE EM WAR)
They schemin and I-Beam'n
Hitmen like cryin freeman, they need cleanin
Keep it comin til they all runnin, screamin, bloody murder
At war with them inner demons, it's goin down
Invasion, U.S.A., spittin rounds
If these shells hit the battleground, pave the way
for birth of a Generation, X
Spoken with a project dialect, bomb threat
to the air waves, hit the deck
Pressed for time in a world lacking sunshine
Got love for my family, cause they mine
See niggaz dying in the streets over petty crimes
We gonna eat, or die tryin, got my mind made up
Young buck, just don't give a fuck, pressin they luck
When they best, best to give it up, perfect world
Baby what? Nigga head or gut, them or us
Welcome to the dark ages, dirty pages
Of filth, fine filth flavors
Dust to dust, and ashes to ashes, life flashes
Right before his eyes, then he passes
While the 666 got more tricks
Than the PD's got bricks
From bloods and crips
To pips with mints
We still lickin the scars from whips on slave ships
Mr. Sandman, bring 'em a dream, infa-red light beams
Homicide scene, perfect world
By any means get cream
Just don't let it come between you and I, seen
Everything is everything in this three ringed, circus
Peoples is swift, tryin to work us, lord
with devil worship and satanic verses
It takes place in the world, perfect, mine and yours
Uhh.. the children are the future
And Wu-Tang is for the babies!

Ha, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
One time.. yo
Never liked son from day one, bring you tool
That nigga stick you and play dumb, hate a bitch-ass
Who care where you came from, you ain't prepared
for when the pain come, this nigga scared, shook to death
from a cold stare, stuntin, knowin my brothers fiend
to do you somethin over here, we head huntin
in the function I smell fear, adrenaline start pumpin
I Smash Pumpkins, Hard Rock be in the Cafe
Tear the club up, and anyone that try to judge us
The last days, makin sure I get the last say
In the food chain, is you predator or prey?
If you featherweight, lyrics blow your back
crack your vertabrae, lookin for a better way
to get my point across, thoughts accelerate
at the same speed, of the muder rate
Lord, never perpetrate a fraud, til my nigga Carlton Fisk
see the boss, truly yours, Mr. Meth
[Street Life]
Life's a snippet, one way ticket
Time tickin fast, blink you might miss it
Semen on Street shit, you might catch fifty stitches
Body bag sprayed up, buried in muddy ditches
I play for keeps, bust heat you catch cold feet
My rap sheet, speak for itself, concrete
Evident, Killa Hill, resident, double dart agent
Secret intelligent my rap style's flagrant
[Chorus One: all]
Feel the sting of a killa bee, Johnny Blaze
Street Life, Deck and Mobb Deep, Play IV Keeps
In the city that you never sleep, pay attention
Ain't no shittin when you gotta eat, we hold it down
[Inspectah Deck]
I move like Mad Max 'cross the wasteland
One hand holds the head of the last brave man
Made man, Cuban Link chain of command
Authorized fam', hot like Sahara sand
My live team turn the club to a crime scene
High beams flash, promoters die behind CREAM
Get your face blown, might face the chrome
We take this more serious than just a poem
[Havoc]
I think about a lot of shit, especially when I'm bent
About the foul shit goin on in my life, current event
It's evident I smoke ciggarette down to Brownsville
Thinkin to myself -- how many lives must my pound kill?
Hopefully none, ain't the one to give chase
Hemmed by Jake, worryin who might turn state's
So I chill, put my killa niggaz on the battlefield
On the low plottin silent murderer, never doubt still
never follow beef hey beef follow me
Wanna settle in the court I say settle in the streets
like our pops did it, you got gats get hot with it
Now you dry snitchin, because you got knocked with it
I just rock with it, go with the flow, think for a hot minute
Stash my dough secure the funds of profit
[Prodigy]
Yo, extreme rhyme niggaz, you wastin your time
Fuckin with my niggaz, extrordinary line swishin
your mind out position, tryin to figure this shit
Rewind it and listen quick, you might miss this
Olympic, rap jave-lon, travel beyond, your weak song
Doin this for too long, to not come strong
You're only a pawn of Viet Dong
Tryin to form against mines, you musta just been born
Secluded on a distant farm
This is the real world, where niggaz get shot and shanked
Where there's tremendous pain, you get your frame inflamed
Crushed to dust, by the next man's clutch
It's Infamous you fucks, intense bad luck..
[Chorus One]
Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready
for a war here, fuck peace, what?
[Chorus One]
Stand strong on our two feet, we all ready

Leave you assed out, passed out, it's cold
Pack your heat up, blow your back out
You bad mouth, make 'em all believers
Throwing rocks from a glass house, y'all ain't perfect either
See that cheeba and that hash out (garbage day tomorrow)
And I have yet to take that trash out, or emptied this cigar

It ain't nothing, like the French say; ""che sera sera""
So let's move on, until the day we laying in the casket
With them suits on, and I'm so cool that hell is only luke warm
Been too strong, for too, long, I'll probably die
With my boots on, and on my way to cash a coochie coupon
You know I'm, proper, don't let them boys confuse you
The fact is Meth, I'm harder than bottles made by Yoo-Hoo

Where the truth aim, flying out the mouth of flying rappers
There it is...

Now, ask yourself, is this for real, it can't be

Outblew his liver, a river flooded, what's happening

That W, the legacy of little niggaz muggin' you

Benches used to pluck niggaz, we be on the roof, like ""fuck you""
Them red beams is coming, losers, got to walk the plank
Users, with uzi's on 'em, you move, you getting spanked
Shank broilers banked, alcoholics ranked ballers
They should call us, I rock mad ice like a walrus
The lamesters decided to lure us, we was up in Freedomtown
Getting weeded, one Bentley tour bus, you might like the mack and explore dust
You can't fuck with all of us, one of us dropped, there's twenty more of us

Peel caps like tangerines, you shook/shake like tamberines
Then, jet from the set, in the all black Lamborghin'
Nobody seen me, bitch in a tini red bikini
Niggaz saw her, because they thought they saw a genie
Heidi Klum, pussy juicy, fat as a plum
Picture on the wall in jail, niggaz jerk til they come
God gargantuan, large, colossus, bombardment of darts
Make your squad, throw tantrums
Practice karma sutra on broads, pop bra's
Leave birds with permanent scars, and shit like birthmarks
Digi bark back at dogs, snatch flies from frogs
Blow California chronic to despise the smog
This shit I been with biz in the clearing, pigs sharing

Move to rep a two or G., shine like fine jewelry

Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime

Broke the record flowin, without any knowin

You win some you lose some, it's in the game)
Freestylin, profilin, won't catch me smilin
Straight from Fema Island, buckwhylin, I'm stylin
A funky type of style with the lyrical incision
S--t locked down, like my n----z out in prison
Good riddance, keep it hidden, up in my knapsack
Sippin cognac, while I vibe off this funky track
Yo bring it back, or make it hit harder
Infiltrate your mind like Nino at the Carter, but smarter
So drop harder, if you wanna conjugate
Verbs and nouns, make it profound as I pound
In your earpiece I'm the beast
To say the least, we must increase, the peace
But keep it real, so I can feel, the skills
Funky fresh rhymes I will build so I kill
and thrill, lyrics spittin, through my lips
Doin backflips, it's another hit
Come take a sip, of the running Watters
Lyrically I slaughter, mentally I author
the rhymes that you feel to the map
Crushin double barrels, sing em out like carols
Who it be? It be I, the n---a with the chinky eyes
From NY, city we committee we gets busy
With killa beez on the swarm
Lyrically we storm, mentally a lord
Verbally I bomb (boom!), guard your grill
It's the man that chill, run for the hills from Grassvile
Drillin rhymes straight on tracks and double cuff
Another TV, and they loved it
(You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
You win some you lose some, that's in the game
You win some you lose some, that's how it go son
You win some you lose some, that's in the game
It's in the game
You win some you lose some, it's in the game
It's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game, it's in the game)

Uhh.. uhh.. uhh.. (yo c'mon Big) uhh..
Fuck that, I preach it, my nine reaches
the prestigious, cats that speak this, Willie shit
Flooded pieces, my hand releases, snatches
Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what
The rings and things you sing about, bring em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White
Your hand clutching, your chest-plate contemplate
You bought to die, nigga wait, keep yo' hands high
[Redman]
Yo.. yo yo
I don't brownnose out of town hoes
I'm up around fo' with the crowbar to the five point oh
I get bagged, I'm John Doe, suspect
You ass like prime roastin, Calvin Klein clothes
Explode the pyros when Doc guest appear
I'm out there, I bought it with George Jetson here
Your time is near, so get your body dropped off
I stopped trustin niggaz since Gotti got caught
It's Bricks keep your wrist covered, or piss colored
By the waist got a gun as dark as Kris brother
I.C.U., my sheisty crew, like ice me too
I break your legs, leave your eyes slightly blue
The Doc was born with a grenade palm
I'm concurrent in your hood like a, teenage mom
Yo Biggie (what what) She havin my bay-bayy
If I pull out the A.K., keep your hands high
""This rule is so underrated.."" -> [B.I.G.]
""Actin as if it can't happen, you're frontin"" -> [Meth]
""Ain't no other kings in this rap thing.."" -> [B.I.G.]

Y'all pick seeds out y'all weed, I watch cowards bleed
Motherfucker please, it's my block with my rocks
Fuck that hip-hop, them one-two's, and you don't stops
Me and my nigga Lance, took Kim and Cee's advance
Bought ten bricks, four pounds of weed plants
from Branson, now we lampin, twelve room mansion
Bitches get naked off ""Get Money"", ""Player's Anthem""
Don't forget, ""One More Chance"" and, my other hits, other shit
niggaz spit be counterfeit, robbery come actually
in and out like fuckin rapidly, pass the gat to me
Make his chest rest, where his back should be, talkin blasphemy
Blastin me, your family, rest in coffins often

Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer

Now now
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket
I take these adolescents back to Spofford
Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
that's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines;
bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
and three charges, I got to ""See-three-P.O.'s""
This is whoop-yo'-ass-day, the sequel
Eyeball blower with no equal, niggaz swingin swords in the WAR
that's my people, sho' nuff, befo' I roll up
This is a hold up, hands high, reach for the sky
I rep S.I., the unpretty, word to Left Eye
New York Shitty, put they weight on it
And who better for the job than Biggie  The Notorious
Jeee-zus, ""Unbelievable"" rhyme that reaches
and touch individual, small frame buck and change
MC, What's-Your-Name, tuck your chain
All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin
Hot -- forcin my way up in the
to kill the bullshit like a matador
Keep your hands high (what)

Jet back to the lab like they were being chased by homicide
My rap flow does you like Tical,
and it will never steer you wrong
And all you bitch-ass niggaz in the industry
your careers won't be lasting long
[Chorus]
[Verse One:]
Check it, I'm the fuckin man, who they mention
Notice, that other niggaz rap styles is bogus
Doo-doo, prepare for this verse Tical voodoo
Blazin, the stuff that ignites stimulation
Inside ya, cuz I be that house over water
forgot in the realm that be deep as the Poseidon
adventure, niggaz need to touch they freakin picture
For the sickness, that be spreadin with the quickness
Remedies, cousin I be doin on my enemies
Penalty, then I drink forties to they memories
Emotion, rushin through your down street vicinity
Blunt smoke, in the air reveals my identity
(Tical.... tical... ti-cal, ti-cal...)
As I keep it movin, we keep it movin uh
Keep it movin, and keep it movin uh
Keep it movin baby we be movin uh
Keep it movin, we keep it huh RHARHHH
What's that rhythm what's that sound

When it hit the baddest man
Just release, yo delf!!
[Verse Two:]
My God, somebody said it's on, if it isn't I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for the headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I bring it to the Pope, word to mother
Serial, killa, style from Big Isle
No Stat, my peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean thick
Niggaz lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggaz think they bigga
Cause they got the finga on the trigga of a pistol
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, wash it down with a Mystic
Then I add a Snapple, nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Then we try to overthrow the castle
Better yet the tent when I'm comin to your town
Black man, the rental, God, the pistol
YAH! If you don't want a burn from GLOCK
Then beware, I buck shots, we move up, the buck stops
Here, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by hoes
What's that rhythm what's that sound
Party people getting down
When it hit the baddest man
Just breathe in, till then
And keep it movin, baby keep it movin
I plan to keep it movin, you know we keep it movin uh
And keep it movin, baby we be movin uh
And keep it movin, you know we keep it movin uh

I'll give my world to you, if you want me to

That's, my, word!

Dominant supreme being, face the mental

Keep my cliches out your dental, capiche?
Shit that I been through is cause for parental

Top of the the world, tell it to my firstborn

on the highway, out the sunroof, yellin
""Thank God it's Friday!"" Show a nigga love
If he got my sound pull the plug, he's not underground

And plus, the only thing I trust is a fund
Ain't no fun, just paranoid niggaz totin guns
in apparel, keep us camouflaged in the shadows
That's where I bring this tale that you never get to tattle
Obliterate the tri-state, and the crime rate
Tell them swine niggaz fly straight, you can call it fate
And if it ain't mine, call it fake, bottom line
End the case, spoonfeed the track just a taste
of the side dish, soup of the day, I come Wright like N'Bushe
for them Dead Presidents
Fuck what you say, and he say, and she say, and they say
Vacate the premises, caught up in the melee
Sentence this song, to twenty-five years hard labor
in the system, where it takes the form of my wisdom
Respect mine, take my time and protect nine
Next on the frontline, Mr. Meth
No more no less, what you see is what your ass get
Set it off I suggest
There's nothing in the world that I won't do
I'll give my world to you, if you want me to
I'll do, anything.. anything.. anything.. anything..

So Goldy, mosey to the spot, get that moldy

Slowly I turn, face the one and only
Naughty By Nature, I Do My Dirt All By My Lonely
Ask Pretty Tony, when I got a bitch I keeps a bitch

Radio is the same, whole lotta speculatin'
These mutherfuckas defacatin' on the name
Wu-Tang, if this is where the hip-hop is
Radio lyin' then, that ain't where hip-hop live
It lives in the streets, we eat to live they livin' to eat
I'm fed up, that nigga rides in 'em, givin 'em sleep
R.I.P., make me the king of all I see
And when death call I'm good I got call ID
See it was planned in the front, now they just gon' front
Like my joints is on proactive, and they just don't bump
Then niggas gon' say I lost my skill
when in fact they all been programmed
And lost they feel, fo' real
Chorus: [Lauryn](Method Man]
They've got so much things to say right now
They've got so much things to say
They've got so much things to say right now (Yeah)
They got so much things to say (Yo)
[Method Man]
Damn, another artist chokes again
They ain't cut as close as him or even broke the skin
See how niggas ain't yo friends, when there ain't no ends
Don't care who the case offend, don't underrate my pen
I got what it takes to win, while ya'll are thinking I'm trash
Loving the taste of success and this drink in my glass
Watch 'em cosign that whack shit, give it a pass till it's gone
Quicker than Red, can't get rid of them clubs
When they're wrong, call the cops, they credibility's shot
It's time to learn, what hot really is and really is not
Off brain niggas, Meth gonna let 'em know off top
Don't get smacked on dvds, trying to show off blocks
I can't stop cause my enemies plot, or cause the cops want me
Shackled and locked inside the penalty box
And while they waitin' for my shit to flop
They gettin' pimped like hoes
Sellin' they ass just to get my spot, come on man
Repeat Chorus
Ask Miss Hill, half these critics ain't got half this skill
Often so hungry that they have to steal
If I didn't have my deal, and didn't have this mass appeal
Then I'm back up in that trap, swingin' crack it's real
And that ain't worth the time, so search and find a new nerve
And here's three words: stop working mine
It take a lot more to hurt my pride
Jerk my vibe more than media lies, cry when dirt dog die nigga
The last album wasn't feeling my style
This time my foot up in they ass but they feelin' me now
Cause Tical, he put his heart in every track he do
But somehow yall find someway to give a whack review
It ain't all good, they writin' that I'm Hollywood
Tryin' to tell you my shit ain't ghetto and they hardly hood
Come on man, until you dudes can write some rhymes
Keep that in mind when you find yourself reciting mines
Repeat Chorus

Yeah!
This-this-this-this
This is an exclusive (let's go)
Mr. Meth, you're so Def, you put them other M.C.'s out to rest (that's right)
And they test (uh-huh), but they forget (yeah) how the M-E-F is so Def (let's go)
[Method Man]
Yo, uh, come on, come on, now
Big Meth attack soon as the track come on now
Zone out, with Sean Combs and bizzy-bone out (I see you in the club)
And by one, I'm gettin' thrown out
Mami, got her toes out, ain't one army can Blaze Johnny
Like Gwen Stafani, you know there's No Doubt
I'm trill, sick with it, it's like ill
That's the only way to explain these mic skills
On Homicide Hill, anybody asks is real
The more steel, the more bodybags to fill
Can I get, hit of that hydro, nigga
I tried to quit puffin' before, but I'm no quitter
If honey show me her buns, I'll show her my ones
If the bed rockin', keep knockin' and I'mma cum
Want some, take some, I get it crunk
Speak junk, I'll slow up your road with speed bumps
[Chorus: Missy Elliott w/ P. Diddy doing ad-libs]
When they play this in the club (say what?)
Go and tell that nigga, bump that (say what?)
Throw your hands up, like nigga, what? (say what?)
Ya'll don't really really want that (say what?)
And for whatever muthafucka, don't like it (say what?)
Tell that sucka he can get back (say what?)
Misdemeanor and Meth in your area (say what?)
Are ya'll ready? Come on, play it back (saw what?)
[Method Man]
You wanna front, what? Step up and get bucked
And if your feelin' lucky, duck, then press ya'll luck
Ya'll got me effed up, over tracks overreact
Once I start, like a bullet, ain't no holdin' me back
I'm all that and two mac's, ya'll fakin' jacks
When I cock back like Busta Bust and make 'em clap
Here I go again, who blow in like whirlwinds
Who kiss girlfriends, that kiss they girlfriends
Got to get it, and when I'm gone
Ya'll bury me with chrome, and tell hell I'm comin' home
I'm poison, see my skull and crossbones
Got aim like them kids in Iraq who toss stones
And I got drugs in my system, we thugs in the system
That put slugs in victims, Mr. M-E to F, bomb threat
As long as I ain't no game, there's no contest
[Chorus]
[Method Man]
Ticallion is phatter than your fattest chrome chain
I guess that should explain why I given the dope name
Ain't nothin' free, everything got a fee
How the fuck you got a car and ain't got a pot to pee?
I'ma grown man, so I do grown man things
Why take half, when I can have this whole damn thing?
It's Meth, baby, drop top, navy Mercedes
I'm number one like P.E. or Tracy McGrady
It's all good, everything I spit, all hood
And if ya'll gave me one wish, niggaz, I wish ya'll would
Who John Blaze? Uh, when ya'll gon' learn huh
When I burn son, stick a fork in him he's done
And ladies love to play, like Ladies Love Cool J
For the right CREAM, the'll do anything you say
She Ice Cream, I'm caked up with icing
Mr. Sandman, come on, bring her a pipe dream
[Chorus]
[Outro: P. Diddy]
Let's work... come on
Def Jam! Mr. Meth, Missy, Bad Boy
Hitmen baby, let's work, come on
Let's work, come on, yeah
Uh, let's work... aiyo pass that nigga

Never have you heard a similar sound
Like a drop off when shit pop off, feel a hot one
Side scorching from a hot gun
Niggas get lost in the buildings wit money and the children
Not the type to talk too much and catch feelin
Dominican flag over the bed on the ceiling
Protect everything I rep, that's the first thing
Many things follow, bullet stay hollow

I'm red rum, Reverend Run, brother son, earthquakin
Industry shakin, you kiddin me We money makin
Your money fake son, I'll call you clay cuz you get's Play-Doh
Jamel and Joey Simmons holdin millions on the lay low
Platinum hailos, hero heads high from hydro
Hit the dime on the combo, she try to diss my rhyme flow
She ain't know we only glamorous like Phat Farm fashion
Simmons name sinamous wit this cash
It's our passion... what!
[Run]
Yo basically I'm here to rename rap, it ain't rap no more
Call it Simmons Incorporated, since '74
Lotta money in this fam, think about it
Me wit Run-D.M.C., and him over at Def Jam
Well damn, how the hell you think we livin
How you think it feel to be a Simmons
Imagine Christmas and Thanksgiving
People wanna know why I ain't on my brother's label
If I did this whole rap game be unstable
Went over to Arista wit Mr. Davis, for the change of neighbors
It's only fair that we share those naked papers
You can tell a cat serious about rap and it ain't luck
If 20 years after his first single, his name's stuck
From '74 to '99, did novice to king, wit a million
MC's waitin in line
Keep a barrel on this album if my man's and them rise
[Method Man]
Now speed it up, uh
[Chorus 2X: Run]
Run really make ya wanna drop, drop
Now wanna make ya go live, live
Now wanna make ya go live, live
Now hold up
[Method Man]
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
John-John Phenomenon, deadly but calm
Word to my born, dead by dawn
Got the right to bear arm, ring the alarm!
Another sound boy dyin, hot irons
Slugs flyin out the hardware appliance
Baby mamma cryin, sobbin and grievin
You was at aws wit them kids till they made it even
Let down ya guard, yes you did, now you barely breathin
To unaware, open season on a duck, we don't give a what
Yo best best to give it up
Sho indeed, let's Run D's MC's, they phony
Some hump free, they mad bogey
Saddle up ya horse, if the sunset mosey
Jam Master Jay deserve a trophy for this track, right
Futuristic G past type, if that's yo girlfriend
She wasn't last night punk, little boy
Stylin mad chump, ain't no wins here
This sport's extreme, know what I mean
Gettin royalty, +Down With the King+!!!

Crack, crack, cracks in the cradle
Cracks, in the cradle
Cracks in the cradle, cokes in the spoon
Little Boy Blue higher than the moon
Will he, will he want a weapons, will he wanted the wound
I come to school and lay down the rules
Two, two, two channel empty guzzle, brake gallons of drop
Shorty wit the forty, once sport in the dark
Co-co-corner, black as a goner
Didn't really wanna call my momma in Savannah
[Mike Ransom]
I spit dynamite ignite turn off lights
Recite, spit poetry type, get my squad physically hype
Get a hundred blast from Funkmaster, crush ya life
+Blast+ Time to go now, show these fake rappers the way to go down
Down With The Kings, like Smokey down wit Motown
Who wanna come and see, come and test me
Take about a million MC's to wet me
For Run-D.M.C. I let shells fly, freein the five
Wit the red eye, niggas talkin to much
Tape 'em up, leave 'em hog tied

You thinkin about it way to hard, how to get down wit the Gods

Assed out in the bleachers stay shittin on the game

OWWW! Fellas pull ya cock out
On the verge to splurge verbs for third round knock out
Uh I bust a rhyme that dust frustrated rappers
Dust crush competition, lights out like the Clapper
The mic ripper, whip a nigga like a slave
Separate him from him from his fam, he don't know how to behave
Now, drag his ass, bag dun for his loot
Figure me to give a nigger-y twenty-one gun salute
That's seven shots for Tupac
Seven for Biggie Smalls
Seven for Freaky Tah up in your neighborhood malls
How's that, fat action packed rap remain tame
Pharoahe fuckin Monch, ain't a damn thing changed

Yo we don't only get money, we cut the coke and cook the shake over
You better guard your head right, especially if it's late at night
Or find your picture of your autoposy up on the web site
Yo if you ever violate my space
Fuck a fat lip, I'll leave you wit a fuckin fat face
Nigga, Busta Rhymes the handsome, I'll hold you for ransom ansom
Like the ghost in a haunted house, I'll forever live in a mansion
Bitches, snitches comin out and you know who's showin it
Like when British civil servants pass secrets to the Soviets
Y'all niggas is seemless blends of seemless friends
Live on about   on a bunch of seamless ends
Collosal, me and my nigga Pharoahe Moncho
The head honcho, gettin this money like Leonardo (do do do)
Enough substance in the roughness
Now watch it come around in an amazing large abundance
Now let me clear the smoke screen you blow fiend
Live nigga shit that'll rebuild your whole self-esteem
Pledge allegiance to the flag of united live niggas of America
Let us control and own the fuckin area
Wildin in your whip until your crash the whole truck up
And if  get to you nigga you better GET THE FUCK UP!!!

Make marijuana legal, make marijuana legal
Make marijuana legal, make marijuana legal (well speak your mind then)
Ok, I will, no one has the right to tell me what I can do with my own body
What I can eat, drink or smoke, this is a free country
And no one can take away my constitutional rights
Hey man, can you put me on and I can say anything I want
Is that what I need to do? (Yea)
Then why isin't alcohol made illegal? Why isin't that
While you drinking it, it hang on and disposes your liver
Besides that, it's a habitat for alcohol
Besides that, cigarettes are much worse than pot
No one ever got killed by pot (you tell 'em, you tell 'em)
God damn it, man, everything, you can get us anything you want

Make marijuana legal, what's so bad anyway
What's so bad about feeling good?

Then split a honey Dutch, roll it up, can't roll with us
If you can't hold your liquor, throw it up, y'all know what up
See we them niggaz, ain't no hoe in us, the flow is nuts

But if you Enter the Wu-Tang, you tripping
Like somebody tied together your shoestring, now listen
I'm the, real deal, come on, come back to get ya like bad karma
Y'all niggaz is throwing rocks with glass armor
Fuck the court system, pleading the fifth
And if Def Jam is deaf, start reading my lips
I'm cocky, possibly I got my reasons and shit
They ain't built a man that can stop me from feeding my kids

And if you don't know where I'm coming from, never know where I be in

Probably got a vest on, but your thoughts react like a young pawn
That's when I swarm on your street dreams you mor-on
Carry on, forty lead dons went through your Teflon
I remained calm, even though you straight passed through my left arm
I never fold I reload, keep my clip full mode
Empty out six slick, to bloody up your wardrobe
Plus that click you run with, I heard y'all niggaz rub dicks
Greet niggaz with a french kiss, some real fag shit
Seen the bitch in you, from the first day you came through
Saw the size of my crew, and started actin brand new
That bullshit you pulled, you gon' pay too
You went bubblin blue, it's dead on the avenue
I bailed you out, passed off a key to the stash house
So you could lay low, from your P.O., before you mashed out

Can you dig it, you'll never stop the kid up in the fitted
Live with it, somebody done fucked up
[Method Man]
Look, I'm cutting corners on these clowns, marijuana and pounds
Found with Staten Island niggaz that run up on you with rounds
Take a drag, pass it around, guess who back in your town
And the crowd vict', with Officer Brown patting him down
Shit's thick, thick as harmony grits, cuz with some thugs
Ain't no, harmony bitch, them niggaz probably snitch
Y'all be the judge, look what happened to Cocheese
What happens when your co-d's is talking to police, you dig?
Half a cig, let me fuck with ya wig, although you loving the style
They're ain't a pedophile could fuck with the kid
Now that I'm back up on my, feet, take it back to the streets
In the GM with your BM, in the passenger seat
Riding hood, by my hood, ain't no hike in the wood
Life is good, it's so good, live it twice if I could
Man, it's me, once again it's that Wu-Tang
Crushing the shit that you bring, you know how we do things
[Chorus]
[Method Man]
Yo, pulling my shoes up, scuffing my Timbs, back to when?
Puffing again, who stunting, cops fucking with them
Feeling the blow, goosebumping the skin, and on the scale
Of nothing to ten, a ten, man, it's nothing to him
See you can tell by how I'm clutching my pen, like Mae Weather touching her chin
She stunting, going up in her friend
Tell the label give me something to spin, and every light got a price
You want a slice, but we ain't cutting you in
Man, these fiends know my past work, held a monkey until they back hurt
Money talking, wonder what that's worth
And MCF, mean Cash First shit, picture the kid
On the beach in Hawaii, minus the grass skirt
Blast first, ask questions last
Black herse, nigga, stretch yo ass, y'all niggaz know what this is
It's New Yitty, this ain't just a fad
It's M-E-F, and I ain't Biggie, but I'm just as Bad, Boy
[Chorus]
[Outro: Method Man]
Yeah, Big M-E-F, Staten Island Advance, motherfuckers
Word up, don't ever count me out, just count me the fuck in
I'll be back for more...

Yo yo
Brain is punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Moving with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
? the head in, (not sure of this verse)
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine,
Anytime you reveal your snake is raising actions
Observe the magnetic attraction
[Method Man]
And its time for some grid...
[Street Life]
...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel throw you off the Farasauno
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I raked body guard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark, P.L.O
Plus like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, checks in afro, we back yo,
Stole-a-mite, crash your wind pipe, with the (right to right?)
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot-out street lights
[Method Man]
Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin, merging with my aye-a-like
Splergin, dirty to the grain, no detergant
Filthy, innocent till I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, its curtains

It aint nothing like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most D.J.'s won't refuse it

Too much to gain you'll abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is completely captured bass

Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlov, 9 Glocks
Technique your rhyme part machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckle the foe, intro to outro

I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go beserk
>From the Shao burrow, wylin out on the furlow
Commando, style thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermal nuclear degrees
Heads of underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the garden, the fierce stampede
>From the die cast, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, had a gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust
[Killa Sin]
We be the world's most fabulous, hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killas get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagent, ? drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphie ??
Watch my pockets ride, to the bottom bus
Confide in God and Sin, I trust the villianous
Criminal minded killas rust
I intend to build a fortifying man,
Mastermind vying men, navigate the globe and retire quick

Aiyyo fluid rap bend, through a black Veluga black act
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical, mathematical
Slide up in your worth casual
Night air dog, who wear it all, blouse down to bra
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network beserk, mad hurting
Killing whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomindales

Fuck yall niggas carve my ice through my beige window

Blaze bring the heat to your Mourning like Alonzo
Head honcho like Eastwood, gun in my pancho
Another bad desperado, trapped inbetween
the hills and the El Dorados, but you can't do that
Welcome to the Wheel of Fortune where Pat don't Sajak
Bring it to these cats often, the biggest payback

Stick a pen, do em in, eight million stories
in the naked Mr. Method, Blade Runner
Blood stain on my track record, top gunner

Can't quit now, hard as a brick, what's this

Hand writtin ass whippin, I keep spittin
At any head-on collision, throw dart wit precision
And split decision, tell your old folk

Broadway classical, led men to rage
Like currents, the beat change and now a flow is strange
You in the arctic wit wolves that viciously main
Thugs that roam clubs, in the dark wit fireworks that spark
Saltwater vibrations comin from sharks
Blood-thirsty kids bite just as well as I write
You're like secretaries who can't type, you're no use
Broke down vessels who want a boost, there's no jokes
Quick fast you, get stumped cuz you played, your organ pump
Kool-Aid, from Indiana wit the Jones of a Lost Crusade
Hip-hop done hit the church, choir girls rockin mini skirts

Penitentiaries is either half-dead or too sweet
Back to basic, condition-al god, plus I can take it

Word up, our niggas is strapped, ready for war on the ill block
Things just ain't peace no more, fuck it
If you ain't with me then forget me
Niggas try to stick me, retaliation, no hesitation, shifty
Creepin' niggas in the dark, triggas with no heart
Rippin' ass apart, I'll be swimmin' with the sharks now
Stay out my water or it's manslaughter
Kid, you oughta start reachin' for that nickle-plated auto-
Matic, my thoughts get sporadic, loaded raps
Bustin' mad shots to ya attic

Straight from Hazard County with a bounty on his head, and it said
""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" I swear by the whites of they eyes
To never take a dive I will survive

So what my martial law drops bombs like Qur'an
The ism helps to stimulate my pugilism
I bust rhymes like jizm, impregnate the rhythm with the wisdom
Decipher the flow, I be hyper, I bring all the styles
That rekindle like old flames
Saliva, check the wicked flows I deliva
Oops, I mean deliver like the Hudson River

Four years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Meth and it went this way
Yo, we took a test to become an MC
All the withers in the crowd got amazed at me
God threw me inside his Cadillac
The chaffuer drove off and we never came back
Meth cut the record down to the bone
And now I rock solid chrome microphones
Now we signing autographs, with cheers and laughs
Champagne, caviar, and bubblebaths, but see...
That's the life that I lead, you sucka MC, we G-O-D
Take that and move back, or catch a heartattack
Because there's nothing in the world the gods could ever lack
I chill at the party in my b-boy stance
Walk, cap low, 45 in my pants
Fly like a dove, that come from up above
My nigga's Iron Lung but you can stay one love
It's just a one two three a three a two one
Throw your blunts in the air for the god Iron Lung
Blow them right in your face with the bass
You messed up, come in first place, the real rap taste
First come, first serve basis
Coolin out boo, take you to the def places
One of a kind for you people's delight
And to you sucker MC, you know it ain't right
Bet you bite all your life, cheat on your wife
Run in a gun fight with nuthin but a knife
Bangin with your boy, slingin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
It's the one two three three two one
Throw your blunts in the air for your dunn Iron Lung
Smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
Come in first place in the real rap race
Go uptown, buy a bag of brown
You sucker MC, a sad face clown
Gettin OD ready to rock crowds steady
You drive a big car get your gas from Getti

I'm ODB in the place to be
Didn't go to St. John's University
In the streets of Brooklyn I aquired the knowledge

Cocked her legs, cold fucked my head up

Out of control, still whippin it, steadily hittin it
Deep strokin, one hand on the wheel, blunt smokin
Lovin how it feel, Sweet Love you got me open, what?

I flashed my fronts on her, like if I had a chance
She said, ""Ain't you Cappadonna from the Wu-Tang Clan?""

We talk without sayin nuttin, you told me if I came through
you'd gimme som'in, now we lockin ass
Pullin hair and talkin trash, how you like it
slow or fast? She said, ""I like it when it last""
No doubt, you got the best trout there can be
Not an everyday, average, Chicken of the Sea, candidate for H.I.V.
You'd rather deal with monogamy
Queen to be held, Black Mahogany
You're bout to bust damnit, sugar walls comin down
Now you can't stand it, you've been touched
That's when I felt the blood rush
Gettin closer and closer with every thrust, take me there
Volcano's about to erupt, I love you much
""Watch these rap niggaz get all up in your guts""

Yo, flipmode,

When Doc come drop a shitload
Grip fo's
Mushrooms, dick those
Deep pistol
Whip hoes

Money, Roll, I stick a zipcode
Tiptoed, before Doc escape row
Thirsty, snippin' out a pig nose
My Benz too, with wings and 6-0's
My flows is North Pole cold
My hands got area's that fits snow
Doc, fixin' hoes in disco's
My dogs let 'em walk with ripped clothes
Shows, Niggas pack 6 rolls
We're losin' 'em
His hart won't get pulse
Pack you bags off a 10 percent doze
(?), I could hum and shit cold
[Chorus:]

Yo, yo tear the roof off

Back off, don't make me shoot y'all
You don't want to fuck with us

[Verse 2:]
[Method Man]
I get scanned, rip sand
With this stick style
Pistol, lick ground
Get off my dick now
Kick crowd, hot style
You-get-shot-style
Timid, scared to get in it
These dogs is rock rowd
Unchained, untained, you know my name
Act strange, pack flame
It's not a game
The ill flows, that kills shows
You can feel yo
Kickin' in you do', like a steel
Go for real dough
Y'all gon learn I spit germs
When you come shot on Big Worm
You gets burned
Punks don't get turned, they get done
And get sun, come get some
The last victim lye in a ditch
Now who wanna fuck with Hot Nick
Niggas chew gum with they ass and pop shit
Me and Funk Doc get,
toxid
Up all the rightness
I'm chopstick
Go make your Wu just imposters
[Chorus:]
[Verse 3:]
[Redman]
You try to O.K Corel
With Doc and Meth Tical
Barsaloon fight without weapons out
Strechmarks like Belly on Kevin ?Lous?
On yard to score, only second down
Hoes play wifey, wanna settle down
Try to lock cash, bitch better bounce
Boyfriend jumpin', Meth shut 'em down
Pound to echo loud, bout 7 miles
Doc, dirty Jersey, hunt 'em down
Uncut rhymes, won't even fit your foul
Baddest man out the bunch, pick 'em out
Drunk with a gun, miss you hit the crowd
Snitches, someone kiss to stitch you mouth
Wilder then rhinos or liquor trous
Mrs. how Mary-Ann, dick 'em out
Ginger watch with the gun and skip a mouth
Love the ruckas and love to dish it out
3 watched MC's, start wristin' out
Get your whole camp put on the missile foul
Pushin' 12 out, bumpin' digital
[Chorus]
[Verse 4:]
[Method Man]
We just ice
Men of mice, ain't nothing nice
[Redman]
Fuck you like
[Method Man]
Your thight is to light to fight
We move right, on fright night
When Niggas write
We bust pipe, condo's that suck thight
We all right, you all hype and war's right
In the Source, with half mic, you half liked
And half dead, blasted on glass bed
(?), eyes red, the hashhead
Burn somethin', earn somethin' and learn somethin'
Take my turn frontin'
Def Jam ain't heard nothin', yet
Suspect, ruffnecks
Buck 'em down or you get busted
Never leave home without my musket
Thrust this, out for justice, clown
And caught on Judgement Day,
caught y'all proud
Take MC's to town if they start blawn
Ashes to ashes, they all fall ground
Master be basket with hazardous tactics
Send my automatic full rap metal jacket
Blasted in plastic your brain on the mattrress
All you kids ask backwards and visa versa
[Chorus:]
[Outro:]

Come on, yo tear the roof off

Back off, don't make me shoot y'all

Big pimpin', all dames is all game
So fine with her beautiful mind, she all brain
A head docter, get it poppin' like Reddenbacher
Chicks call me gravel pit dick, the bed rocker

When Three's Company ask pigeon who Jack trippin'

And if she come up missin', don't worry she went pimpin'
Ya gotta be, down with the cause before ya come
Down with the drawers, how many of y'all down with mcnage

But is it worth not knowing if you're gonna be around (now, now)
[Verse 3 - Method Man]
Who the fuck is your daddy, and who your king girl
Are you unhappily married, don't see no wind girl
Soul sister, can't get ya ta hail witch-ya

Y'all  amateurs act like hoes affendin us
We're special eders go on tours on banana bus
D. O. same m.o., drive through bricks
Chicken shotty, that ass make me lie to my bitch
Word to god doc throw more lines then fishin rod
No stars, we're supergod non recouperb-alls (yo)
Buttons is pressed to remove the press
Press a bullshit, my index press a full clip (YO)
Set up cones when I'm firing chrom
I hittin ladies to old men in retirement homes
Dail 9-1-1 runnin gun in the street dungeon
Earth, moon and stars checkin out what the sun done
Suspects change clothes
Before I leave the heat, I put two in rain grove for my range rove
Hot to death, cops is vex

Drive by on the baja
Snatch the cartier watch I
Boucnce laughing off like clue ""HAHA""
Doc is like poppy, supplying you grand
So breaka breaka while I turn it to the Shoalin Man

Nigga duck the mic when we come around
Control hammer like the mighty Thor
Bringin thunda down
Now you're in store for predator
Like refugees I come to settle score
Half-baked medifore, that taste even better raw
Hardcore holy war
Hits from the resevoir, southpaw saboteur
Land sharks get they chin checked when I jabba jaw
Time to walk my labrodor
Livin out my dreams, at the same time shatter yours
Code red fill 'em full of lead
Greatful dead live from Hemstead
Tiger Kunk Fu know the ledge
Check the full fledged knucklehead
Clam bread, livin on the edge used to be the best
Jack Frost sniffin at your nose, get your Suddafed
Rap Cheech and Chong, me and Red official budda head
Off track like O.D.B., I'm too black
I'm like Zoro, I mark a Wu, sign your back, motherfucka

Bubonic plague any M.C., that swear he illa
Inject the dufus wit the lupus
Yukmouth rhymes that leave him toothless
My filled fly and filled groupless
Observe the record, livin out my name Repid
Study man and all his methods
And through his ethic, learn to expect the unexpected
One step ahead I, return like Jedi
Three hours behind your punk ass, catchin a red eye
First class but cooler than coach, murder he wrote
On the wall of the bathroom stalls shittin these quotes

Just like Shaq in them size 22's
Except my games not a game
And I don't play by any rules man
Its time to build without a hardhat and goggles
Even with a map I'm still a hard head to follow
I thought you knew we do this everyday ok
And I think marijuana is just nature's way of saying hi
Only hydro buds, I get it crunk

Got these wanna-be gangstas, sleeping with they lights on
Shook up by the python, everybody got they eyes on
Not only is the streets watching, the streets is talking
And word has it that these rappers don't come around at all
Take it from the most stepped on, your wearing open toe sandals
And I'm looking for some new toes to step on
And one to build a rep on, you all got me fucked up

Unrealistic wavelength draining on your brain-strip inflicted
Crossword puzzling your delf
Questioning your own mental health (yeah) it's like a maze within itself

Searching for the Dark Knight
Lurking in the shadows of the city, he roll with jiggy

Take a journey through the mind of a Riddler

Tax free money not a problem
A heist to get the ice not a problem
A body for a price not a problem
Hmmmmmmm.... it's The Riddler
[Verse Two:]
Once again it's the mind bender, three-time felony offender
Demented, brain cemented, mixed in the blender
I lose ya, mass-confusion, question mark clues in
What where why whose-it, QUIZZZ
Time to ask yourself who it is
Sheisty P.L.O. underhanded biz, invading brothers wigs
Can I live
Corrupt and bringing all the misery and suffering
Pain, you couldn't cure with a Bufferin
Rotating, ridiculous, rapid-fire riddles
Bat get trapped in the middle of The Riddler

Murder for the evil not a problem
To the gen there is no sequel not a problem (not a problem)
Big up to all my people not a problem (not a problem)

Observe if you will
I'm in my hide-out in the back of the hill (of the hill)
I crack a wall then I caught about a mil (bout a millll)
Co-defendant Johnny Blaze and Bobby Steels (Bobby Steels)
We was blazing hardware (hardware)
Turn the corner you can hear the wheels squeel [rehrrarrrr]
On that ass fast was the Batmobile (Batmobile)
I could tell by the demon on the grill, this was real
Alley-cat screaming, I hit a trash can
Garbage everywhere, money flying out the bags and
trying to escape, jiggy with the cape
Or else he'd be headed upstate, it's The Riddler

Talkin homicide, not a problem (that's no problem)
You want to talk genocide not a problem (that's no problem)
Now if you're speaking genocide not a problem (that's no problem)

Johnny Blaze, I invest in crime cuz it pays
Mad scams, let me count the ways, a crime wave
I make a killing, on the first one to point his finger at the villian
Who be I, the priiimmmmmme

Robbing banks HAH down to grand theft what we want

Quarter a Lucy, quarter more for a groupie
That like to pop snoopy, think she gon' pop coochie
Just cuz you got Gucci, don't mean you not hoochie
Girl, I tell it like a T-I-N
Ain't no other kids eatin' till I feed my kids
Trick, oh, you ain't crushin', sister, I can't do nothin' wit you

With no regard for your boulevard, just the shit bag and bullet scar
It's the Riddler, riddle me this, riddle me that
Who the pretender? And who the door man that let them enter?
The Wu-Tang, 36 Cham', what you smokin'?
Got you in the game chokin', like Van Gundy coachin'
Your street team, bunch of weaklings
Don't ever let me catch your reachin'
Respect when a grown man is speakin'
Shh, keep on sleepin', and just like TLC, I keep on ""creepin""
The five percent of ya'll, keep on teachin'
The heat seakin', missile official, that got issues
Like Funk Doc got snot tissue, it's Hott Nikkels
""Everywhere I turn, I see, your face, but you're never there""
[Method Man]
Shh... shit ain't over..
Okay, now, same shit, different day, grindin', gettin' paid
Self at it, automatic, guns that spit and spray
Gotta have it, ass grab it, time to slip and weight
Godbody, House your Party, watch the Kid N Play
Ya'll gon' make me go postal, up in this muthafucka house
Full of bloodsuckers and hoes that love hustlers
Roll that izza, pour me another kizza
Bigga, to my nigga, so drunk they can't get up
Shotguns through nose, hot ones through foes
Let the herb spots run til the cops come, suppose
I was just another stick in the mud, on a Saturday
Thinkin', how I'mma get the fifth in the club
See my crew thick, everyday I fights to prove it
We comes undisputed, with batteries included
Honey's ""bee"" like Meth, I be like what?
They want some free cd's, I'm like ""see these"" nuts
[Outro: Method Man]
If ya'll muthafuckas gettin' high tonight, say all right, haha
If ya'll muthafuckas gettin' drunk tonight, say all right, haha
It be Tical, ok, haha, yeah, yeah, ok
It be Tical, ok, haha, yeah..

I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick
To stop me from that HIV shit
And niggaz know thet like a Twinkie filling
Playin the villian
Prepare for this rap killin
Biggie Smallz is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
""What you talkin bout Willis""
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
is here to excite and
throw dick toykes
Bitches I like em brainless
Guns I like em stainless steel
I wan the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Don't tempt me (T-H-O-D Man)
You don't want to fuck with Biggie
Here I am, I'll be damned if this ain't hit
Come to spread butter deliverage over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stobitchin, button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin is a can of ass-whippin
Hey, I'll be kickin, you son, you doin all the yappin
Actin as if it can't happen
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin
So what cha want nigga, ya punk nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kickin down your god damn door (and it goes a lil somethin like this)
[Chorus:]
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard fot it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on
[Verse Two: Meth, Notorious]
Verse two, comin with that Olde E brew
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I.C.U.
I'm lifted troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it
(Assume the position) Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus
(I got more glocks and techs than you)
I make it hot (Nigga won't even stand next to you)
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so

In my mind I'm rippin' your clothes
Playing with your feet girl suckin your toes
Go round with the Ghetto Sarano', mello,
Romeo, who like his women on the same level
Pay my bills that were due, all accounts settled
Now I'm relaxing like Pa now with Ma Kettle
Baby laughing, earrings in both nipples
Like Janet Jackson, busting out her latest fashion
Or the smashin'
Honey come on over here, I **** feet cold
Throw them panties over there, you won't need those
You talk like sex
You walk like sex
Ya smell like sex
Ya yell like sex
And all ya want is Mr. Meth, hell of a man
That can sell an Eskimo a fan
I come equipped for any spot that you want hit
Or want licked, when my dick get the fuck outta here, ahh, shit
I start to think back on how I go hump
In seven minutes to heaven at the age of eleven
Couldn't tell me nuthin' then, can't tell me nuthin' now
Honey child, milkin' the cow, lovin' my style
This is what we do kid, me and them Dru kids
Take 'em blind, crimpin' them crazy, even toothless
Lastly, if you know me don't ask me
Call me Method, Mr. Meth if ya nasty
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 1]
If I move it on the left, will it be hot to death
If I move it on the right, will you make it last all night (Woody)
If I move it up and down, will you make a freaky sound, come on
If I move it in and out, will it make you scream and shout
Come on

Niggaz ain't fit to walk a mile in the dead man's kicks

He ain't nuttin but another, a lone John Doe
That wanna flow, here it is, comin up shit's creek
I come to throw monkey wrenches in your program, sleep

In a whip, with no breaks and I'm hittin the gas
It's a bird, it's a plane, take a look in the sky
Method Man on some shit, niggaz call me The Fly
Cause my style, dates back to hoppin turnstyles
Make ya fear, if ya cutie in the chair, you can bet I'll
get severe on the double I harass it
I don't look for trouble, I'm already trouble
Ya bastard, check the wicked flows that I crafted
Open up a deadly venom style to be mastered
By a psychopathic, way beyond an average
Joe, with a hellafied flow, there ya have it

Do dat, pussy cat rap, boy, I'll screw that
To' up, from the flow up, don't even show up
To the battle, I heard you rattle now hold up
Is there a fuckin snake in my garden?
Starvin, for a rap treat, steppin on my feet
Pardon yo delf, before ya find yo delf
In a FUCKED UP situation, without no help

Been in this rap game for like the past
four bullets now, y'know?
Doin bids, yea yea
I done peeped a lotta cats come through
Courageous cats, stray cats, haha
Top cats with top hats, yaknowhatI'msayin?
But it all boils down to this: we talkin lyrics
Rhymes, line for line, numero uno
Who the best? I don't know
Check it
Flame on - I rain fire, when Johnny Storm
I'm shocking like live wire - you have been warned
I prolong this next chamber, to make it strong
And prove all them doubters wrong
Killin Em Softly with this song, addin on
Let them toes get they tag on, dead men run no marathons
On my shift, shootin that gift, knowin he snitched
on the telethon, runnin his lips, sinkin the ship
Give back what his mother gave him, mother made him
and now she can't even save him, Johnny Blaze 'em
Send him to his final restin
Back to the essence, Faces of Death - The Final Lesson
Torture [3X]
Motherfuckin torture, y'all niggaz know
Who got John Blaze shit? Suckin my dick to get famous
So I switch blades to Dangerous
Welcome to my torture chambers
Torture chambers where John Doe's remain nameless, hear me?
I know it's Def Jam, but think clearly
I made it possible for y'all cats to come near me
Keep your enemies, close and your heat closer
I slam just like my culture on all theories
Dead that - straight off the meat rack with this one
You get burned playin Nix-on, Hot Biscuit
Stand back - don't make me spit one, and paint pictures
On the walls of your mental, with hot lead from out these pencils
Iron Lung since I was young and not knowin
where the next meal was comin from, been troublesome
To all those posin a threat
If I go, everybody gotta go next, y'all niggaz know
The code of the street soldier, I'm watchin time
And time watchin me colder, Grim Reaper
Breathin death on my shoulder
Waitin for the day to take me over (take me over)
Torture [3X]
Motherfuckin torture, y'all niggaz know
That you can never touch my flow, go ahead and hate me
Still tryin to fuck my hoe, Johnny-come-latelys?
Got me in a world of shit, and now I'm pissed
Mama said there'd be days like this, tis the SeaZon
for Ducks and my pen's bleedin
Leavin' kids barely breathin for sneak-thievin
Famished from lack of eatin and lack of teachin
Banished from Rhyme & Reason for high treason, can it be
That the kid with the knot knees
Got G to make a grown man cop pleas, for this track
I got a Lovebug like Starsky, blow back
Until I drop Tical Part 3, ain't no stoppin
when you start me, John Jay
Pullin your card, mayday mayday
Niggaz owe they life to God, and now it's payday
Take it how ya wanna take it, fully clothed or butt-naked
I learned the hard way - ain't nuttin sacred
In this world - time to face it, Johnny Basic
Instinct, I'm sure to make it
While others fake it, fuck the spotlight, G-O-D already got light
Say what you like, just spell my name right
No doubt, this one goes out, to all you trout-fish
cake niggaz, keep my dick up out your mouth

Called me every name in the book but I'm still here

to the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some VO (VO)
And mix it with some pena colidino
then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c-notes
Scandalous, yep bitch cause we know
every pretty hoe always down to pull a d-low
On me? No, so there wont be no shaking me down
breaking me down, here we go

No contest, M.E.-Eth Man's obsessed
With sex, drugs and rock & roll
New tecs and calicos!
Word has it we move mathematic on rappers
Who don't add up, you get broke, battered and slapped up
8 million stories in the nekkid call yo man Method
Straight guerilla iller nigga kill a murder record
My verbal shooter does it to ya
The 16-bar Ruger, bustin' yo funky dope manuevers
But I'm not ya Super Lover Cee, I'm the Super Sperm

Wooooooooooord!
[Eminem]
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder
Cuz I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby
I like that!  I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthafuckin' murderers
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it!
Now the parents are suein' cuz little Darren is screwin'
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cuz of me  Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join  Pick up a glock and just point
Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-muthafuckin'-body
I'm so muthafuckin' nutty I don't give a fuck about nuttin'!
[Royce]
My wrist is...water and freeze
And mix this is...audio Jesus the repent shit gets big
Keep it sharp like knife in a pop device
So ""Duro you gotta let it bump!"", I came from a hard knock life
They say this kid be rude like this can't be true
I suck my own dick like if I had a rib removed
Vampire, sun go down I'm still wylin'
Bullets travel through the air in the night like Phil Collins
Rock City baby knife through your throat 'til you're broke
Rise from the underground like sewer smoke
It's all shifty, I got all-a my dogs wit' me
And they all rich, and still all-a they palms itchy
We'll pump, rumble over birds jungle urge
Walkin' like we talkin' drunk while we stumble over words

It's all good. I'm rollin' with my clique,
Owls, Packwoods & Phillies, smokin' sess blunts, mixed with illy
Got me bustin', now the whole world looks dusted,
I'm in the area with the skill that never rusted.
For real, nigga, touch it & you burn, when will motherfuckers learn
What be spreadin' like a germ? Ha ha, it's Meth, word.
I be that early bird that got the worm & if you check it
I'm on point, like a fax machine you get the message.
It be no question & them bust the second guessin's,
Keep your thoughts on your lessons. What the blood claat!
To tell the truth, you don't amaze me. Killa Hill project,
A Star Trek phaser couldn't phase me. What,
Check the Raderuckus FUCK this,
Smoke a Dutchmaster, have 'em screamin' for the duchess
Yeah, I gotta have it, so I strive to stick my piece
If I don't do it for mydelf, I'm a do it for Kase,
'Cause that's my peoples, I'm giving you injections that be Lethal
Weapon, when niggaz start the half steppin',
Then I get evil. But don't let that negative vibe right there
Mislead you, I'm humble, a fucking Killer Bee,
Far from bumble. I sting you BZT and I bring you
Thirty-six chambers of head banger, bitch,
Why I deal with? I think the mic is on the fritz.

You know Busta-Bust had to come see you, God, it's good to see you, God
(Good too see you too, God)
Let's take the streets for a little ride (Okay, we ridin' high)

Huh! And if you ever disrespect the Bust or Meth (find their mentor)
Yeah, I-I-I think the streets been lookin' for this one for a long time

I came to bring the pain, more hard to the brain
Tical... I'm bustin' that ass again
I burn like acid rain, that acid slang
These niggaz try'nna see how I come ash again
Main and evident, I'm huntin', yes, Meth for president
Be in hell with Dazel and George just for the hell of it
And I ain't yellow kid, flows hot as kettle get
Now if you ain't fuckin' with that, you must be celibate
Spaz! Just a little, got a sack lookin' fizzle
Little hash in the middle, where it at? In the middle, yup
Mommy if you got a fat ass, make it jiggle, yup
Put it in my next video shot by Little X
And M-E-F gon' work til their ain't any left
I'm tryin' get what I'm worth and not a penny less
Think fast (come on) bank cash (come on)
Everybody do it with your stank ass (just come on)

Make you rob somebody (what?) grab somebody (what?)
Stomp somebody (what?) slap somebody (what?)
Make you wanna step to the bar and sip Bacardi (what?)

And pick up and pack your shit up, homey, it's time to move
While I'm singin', ma, do you let relieve you of all of your
Figure seating sketching, never believe in your niggaz (come on!)
Go head and babble you can watch me patiently waiting
Aimin', attackin', instead I'mma let one of my bitches slap you
I ain't watch you when your niggaz'll try
To feel a wrath of the un-rudely waking of a sleeping giant
(Very defiant), once I give you the pressure
And then I apply it and then your breathing is stop and totally quiet (sss..
oh)
Captain of this ship, so call me the pilot
I leave you and your crew to collide with me
Die, stomp on a nigga, just like a herd of a thousand cattle
That'll travel over your face and frazzle your shit
Shot you, worst than a brick and then be torturin' you
And then get the reverend, and get to steppin', nigga!
This shit'll make you..

Me and lil' Crook like Bo and Luke duke
When Im in Miama I go to scoop Luke
To see the peep show and hit the duke shoot
Went to Branson, back to back, Lex coup
Up in ""Harlem World"" in my Timb boots
Two suckers had beef so I watched them shoot
Called up Benny Rat, copped a bullet proof
Seen T-Funk he took is to the fruit
Then he went to the Tunnell and brought down the roof
Mink coats and moet, bitches drippin sweat
Slang a cassette to Funkmaster Flex
And now Im bumpin' on East Coast tapedecks
Went from Swatch to platinum Rolex

Im too sexy for my motherfuckin hood, hood

Release from Jones Beach to South Beach, capeesh
Kickin dust as I bust, .... peace

Til death do us part, save my bullets for the charts
With darts, like HBO watching after dark
No love for a mark, even less for a trick
That wanna be like Mike, Mike who my ...
Real shit hotness
Run wit my niggas that aint got shit
Pop shit, and peddle poetry for profit
One time, out for mine, but cant stop it
Trying to keep they hands in my pocket
So I bring obnoxious, infected lah that be toxic
Leave the crop scene spotless
Mix the green with the chocolate, heres the topic

Y'all .. niggas is duckin me like you owe me something
I got more homies than an esse, but lets say
I couldnt talk you wouldnt walk my way on your best day
The best way you can hope to get close to me
Is right here under my wing like you're supposed to be
The first time you start acting fuckin strange
Best to be ducking range
Talkin shit wearing a fuckin' chain

Split em' open like Thomas'
And sell more drugs than a pharmacist
Strapped wit nothing but a rhyme a long history of violent crime
Attitude that doesnt mind doing time

Labels gettin' butterfingers, and next they droppin' you
You think you know, but you have no idea

Somebody told ya'll, steppin' in shit was good luck?
I got the hood stuck, chh-chh, now give the goods up
Ya'll done pushed up, past the point of no return
It's Meth's turn, so roll that shit up and let's burn
I heard Philly got the best 'scherm, out in Cali, they got the best perms
Now that we know, when will the rest learn?
Come on, each one, teach one, hear no evil, and I don't speak none
Everything cool until that heat come
Just call my name, and I'll be there

Ya'll can have it, the problem and answer, I'm all that
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbit, how many kid's done tricked you on your carrots
The product of a bad package, like Bishop Don Juan it's Magic
How I break 'em like a bad habit, hit tracks like it's target practice
Then let these darts take a stab at it
Niggaz ain't got it, ain't never had it

And the passenger seat behind the field

Get dirty money, told you honey, I'm filthy rich

If you thinkin' you gon' slip and be alright, you're wrong
You can see me lightin' the bong, while writin' the songs
That the crowd, is either singin' to or fightin' along, fightin' along
I'm try'nna tell you drugs is not your friends
And girlfriend, don't try and front like you got your friend
I'm at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
And my chick's a man-eater, she be swallowin' men
Aight, live from New York, it's Saturday night
I got pipes that drain your confidence, and battery light
Aight, mami tight, but she ain't really my type
If ya'll don't see me treat her right, then she ain't really my wife
When I was young, I was stayin' in school, obeyin' rules
Play with my food, what makes you think I'm playin' with you?
This is it, ya'll better come on in, the water's fine
Jump on in, let's do it to 'em one more 'gain

A long time he a tell you bout the brutality

But why yo, boat men shan manakhe

But why yo, I vote with equality
But why yo, a-bout Marcus Garvey
We there yo, I feel love his Majesty

Ah nowhere to run and there is no void

Here come that rudebwoy shit, criminology lefit
Legalize dude to get me mega-rich Selassie I

Gettin chinky eye off the stimuli, blazin the gun
And all that good stuff, six-three walk with a strut
On these New York streets like baby what
Anything can happen, it usually does
I'm from Staten, the Island, peep me on G-Street, Ticallion

If you put-ta on de wings and tempt to exit
Then no conjure Christ and none gone bullshit
Ay Selai for the righteous but the wicked are to perish
With them burn the gun and them whole poli-tricks
Half the people dem a turn and half the people dem a twist
Now shoot dem, another ear-trick done perish
Get M some 16 and some rusty-matic
After the whole of them from gone then push up them fists
Leave the ship them a strip, you must get punish
Go ahead, speed up your judgment, stand up boy boy
[Chorus]
So ahh, and one of these day
When you hear a boy faint then uhh

They're gonna run to the rocks
and mountain but they will be no rock, so what we say

Wu-Tang Clan's in the area, Capleton's in the area
We got Shaolin in the area
Big up yourself black man, my brothers
Hell is the plan for the other, discover, discover, discover, c'mon, c'mon
New lands for you man and your family
Reminesce on back in the days, can it be
it was all so simple then, we all kin
And black-skinned, original Don set the trend
Let's be men, if not for us, then for the babies
The little ones the revolution has now begun

These trash talking artists is nothing, niggaz is garbage

Might break a promise, but never, breaking the code

And, if life's a bitch, then I bet she bitter and cold
Everytime she thinking I fold, seven figures get sold

Cops don't know about this Method, but smell it all in his clothes
Yup, I'm still intact, how real is that, I'm back
With enough, fits a million, to figure vanilla wraps up

You know the haters diss you, let's deal with bigger issues
You know New York is dying after all the shit we been through
And we done lost B.I.G., we done lost Pun
Homey, you can't live, gotta go and get them guns
You know the hammers'll lose your cabbage, them dudes do damage
Send Zulu Nation through Reaganomics, we move them package
We pushing rain pain, gotta go and get that money
Y'all going ""hey hey"", but don't that pen look lovely
You - must - not - know - who - y'all niggaz is fucking with
I - can - take - life - nig... just for the fuck of it
Crack's crazy, that nigga'll smack babies
Clap ladies for yackin' you gon' catch shady
Call it a mass shower, the way them hollow's drizzle
Mr. Potato Head, you know them things can't miss you
The Average Joe, with an average flow
Me and Meth bringing back New York, nigga
[Chorus]
[Styles P.]
You don't like me, you can get what's right above the testicles
S.P., turn your top five into vegetables
You don't believe me, get 'em all in a room
And the next five, I plan to getting all of them soon
Y'all can meet me at the table that's round, or get ya place in the ground
That's what you get, when you facing me, clown
Who got the crown, I'm piss on it now, while you wearing it
Nobody nicer than Ghost, I ain't hearing it
Been Nike Airing it, white tee out
Stick-up kid season when the dice be out
I'm a thug or star investing in living, niggaz sippin' soup
Ghost rapper, knocking out your icey mouth
Niggaz in the East wanna unite, not me
If you ain't sayin' I'm the best, you ain't come to be right
KnawImean? If you don't, then you not of being
Your four-four, knock little pieces off of your spleen, nigga

There are few things that's forever, my lady
We can make war or make babies
Back when I was nothin
You made a brother feel like he was somethin
That's why I'm with you to this day boo no frontin

You would rub me on my back and say ""Baby it'll be okay""
Now that's real to a brother like me baby

Wrapped in three-fourths of cloth never showin your stuff off, boo
It be true me for you that's how it is
I be your Noah, you be my Wiz

[Stumic]
I remember back when, a nigga first started rapping
Wu-Tang was the main attraction
Rae and Ghost was the illest team
Deck did his thing on C.R.E.A.M.
Meth made you wanna smoke weed
Dirt and Uey, spit with SWV
I used to rock Cuban Linx and go and double my cheese
Duckin' the D's, RZA was the Prince Rakeem
So peace to the whole Clan and thanks for everything
[Cigars]
Yo, it's hip hop/rap, let's take it back, 1986
When MC Shan, Marley Marl, niggaz rocked the bridge
I watched video hot tracks on T.V.
Kool Moe Dee, Big Daddy Kane, down to Biz Markie
Remember UTFO and The Real Roxanne?
""Eric B. For President"" was a classic jam
KRS repped the Bronx, Boogie Down, rap battles threw down
From the roof top to Polo Grounds
I had the big boom box, thumping Scott LaRock
Hip hop was hot, had shorties doing the wop
And my niggaz used to break dance to Planet Rock
From doing the pop, spinning on the cardboard box
[Polite]
Aiyo, it seems it's all good, but the block is mean
It's like, hip hop, showed me how to rock my jeans
If it wasn't for this rap game, where would I be?
Gunned down, dead in the streets, or locked in the beast
Yo, when Big died, that's the day the world cried
Peace to Pac and Pun, Aaliyah, we ride
Yo, I wanna take this rap game back to the beginning
Where Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay was spinning
Yo, it wasn't easy, niggas had a harder way
Doc The Roc, he spinning on Harbor's day
It's like, hip hop, showed me how to live my life
My name's Jason, but hip hop named me Lite
[Chorus]
[Raekwon]
Straight money, get a live lad
Young seed, color it bad
My wallabees red, the lobby, we graph it
Sell it, had smoke with caves on
Brushin' my way, hide behind wave picture, fly away sensation
Blast takers, be gooses, mad loose, come in the booth
Doug E. Fresh and 'em, Rick and them suits
The raw lotto years, switch up the emblem
More color bottles, gold on a nigga neck
Slidin' around cop Gallo
What? Playin' Union Square
Chillin' with you and who care
My first fade, picture me scared
I bet a high life, and anarchy, can't rob me, all in the train
The 8th baby boy, blowin' on yard weed
R.C. Tone, K-Pin, J-Bosh
The nigga Rosh, Buddha Rob, Black Chavy and Marsh
Move on, I shout yesterday's dons, God love and respect
I hope the dreams come true, word is bond
[P.C.]
When niggaz used to be in cyphers I was sittin in the back
Never said nothin, I just used to listen to rap
Wu was still tryin to get on the map
I was a youngin when I realized that I had a mission in rap
So I grabbed my pen and my pad, gave it everything that I had
I swear I used to sit in the lab
and write all night, niggaz used to make me hype
Freestylin in the mirror with a brush as my mic
[Rhyme Recka]
This is my music, it made me, taught me, raised me
Held me down, 24/7, when I need it from it it gave me
Put me on to the latest gear, put a durag on my hair
Throwback or baseball cap, Air 1's, Triple 5 Vex on my back
This is now but I still remember way back when
When we used to rock Puma's, Gazelles and back spin
Before 106 & Park, they used to throw jams in the park
Cheeba got sparked after dark, twisted in bamboo paper
That was when that battle between KRS-One and MC Shan was major
Kane was raw, what Rakim said on beat was never said before
The streets was hot, on every ghetto and every block
And every radio you walked by was blastin off that real hip hop {*echoes*}
[Chorus]
[movie sample from Casino performed by Joe Pesci]
If you don't have my money for me
I'll crack your fuckin head wide open in front of everybody in the bank
And just about the time that I'm comin out of jail
Hopefully, you'll be comin out of your coma
And guess what?
I'll split ya fuckin head open again
Cuz I'm fuckin stupid

Take it back yo, When I was broke, I was the face of rap,
Rhymin in a baseball cap, Coolin with my aces back then,

What you know about the wisdom, This is history shorty,
Now the gods back, Hard raps, As far as that Oz clap,
Don't cross niggas you don't know, Regardless slap,
Down niggas stop and get up all in his pockets,
Catch his ID, Call the cops kid,
And now we got papers on your little faggot ass.

Wallabee encounters, yo we from New York we never bounce son
We carry cage ways, straight up and don't get down son
Supposed to have blow out and pound son
Ten rastas had masses, fly Nikes, splashes and Porsche glasses
Singles leather opponent, straight from the street baby
Polo jacket, baseball hat matchin' lookin' froze, dumb, unusual
I'm lyin', face the music boo, pendelum loops and swoops
Shells ain't nuttin' to conceal ya fool
I'm young but mostly swift from blunted
Think like chess, drink, note languages blessed
I'm from and era where niggas'll get caught for leathers
Shots are hollerin', hung knees up supportin' the weather
Who the fuck gots mines? Bringin' like Duran with Ross
Bet all y'all niggas are dyin' in cars
Fuckin' with me? It's like luxury
Flow like water in and out of doors, dare a nigga fuck wit' me

Verse Four: Master Killer
God steppin forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact
That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert
That hurts the individual who tries to visual-ize under
Cuz I strike, like thunder
Niggaz couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killa tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity

Represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my
Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so

Fuck Horado Pablos plan growas bravo

The man rockin head bands, silk scarves and jams

The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with 8 million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions

See you soon kid
(Verse One)
The greatest thing a kid could have
To chill with his family, sit back layin on his Dad
Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out
Moms cussed him out, get the fuck out
Couldn't understand it, feelings turnin to hard granite
Now she a one single parent
Growin up on welfare, she might need healthcare
That made me feel no one else cares
Moms is a part of my life forever
Gettin drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather
Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed
Stop cryin Ma take a kiss
Take care of ya brother and sis
Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic (official)
She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate
Took me to school be emaculate
Taught by the best, remember stress
A ghetto agenda that's how we rest
Don't let'em play with your emotions
Lotioning me, little money in my vest
Damn, Mom going through it
Still holding me through it
Sneaker money fucked up
Yo, Yeah when Granddaddy died

Held it in, it hurted Ma alot
Remember, Bucs had me in a tux
Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut

Caught me in the crib yo, smokin
Sat me down heart broken, hopin the phase had me open yo

You my ace, you the lady in the place
You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place
Trust me I'm gonna work hard

Yeah, word up, take it there for these niggas, you know
Word up? Yo.. uh-huh, reminisce, nigga
Word up, nice sunny day, rainy day
Preferable for you and yours, let's blow, yo
[Raekwon]
Who would of thought I would of made it ya'll
Ten years later, still in the gid-game, the Clan, we was one the greatest
We did platinum back in '93, we painted pictures you could see
We was living who ya'll tryin' to be
RZA had a vision, instead of cookin coke in the kitchen
He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin
At first it was a dream to me, Ol' Earth buggin
Put your gun down, screamin that the streets is gon' be needin me
I did the Knowledge to the Wisdom that you spoke to me
The Wu become us, the world enbraced us
A new day, a new life for the God
Got a hood thing, watchin ""Ice Water"" evolve
Destined to build a mountain - niggaz is doubtin my work
Black millionaire, check what I'm worth
I gotta thank y'all for takin in Lex, I appreciate it
I apoligize for keepin y'all waitin

""Yes I got you started all over again"" (2X)
(Word up... let's go back... finish up)
[Raekwon]
Growin' up, we've been through hard times
Life on the streets, just tryin' survive
Plus my niggas got mouth's to feed
We sold to crack fiends, coke, ice and money machines
Shootin' at cops, them maggots tried to stop our C.R.E.A.M
But it won't stop, can't stop, my niggas locked down in a box
I feel your pain, I know you're tryin' to come home
All that weak bullshit, I had to leave it alone
Heard my mom's cryin' at night, we rap on the phone, I love you
Never meant to stress you out, do you wrong, yo I'm workin
Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo
My neighborhood is crime central, sort of like prisons and cops
One on lock, instead of tryin' to defend you
All that bullshit we've been through, time to draw the line right here
Got to stop now, time is the issue
[Interlude: sample (Raekwon)]
""Yes I got you started all over again"" (2X)
(One more jewel... one more... move... let's go, let's go)
[Raekwon]
It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds, that guns don't kill
It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow

Seeing a Benz and look sizzling, don't let it rain, daddy
That's when the reds get more busy
Hyper then shooting at snipers, bloodbaths, some, they laugh
Gleaming in some luxury labs, all the wally down, flicks we flash
Grabbing bitches blowing in whips, every blessing, flip up flags
I put that on my wallet, I'm great, kid with the Purple Tape
Flame names, the Louis Lex Diamonds and the makes
All the bank robbing niggas pump aids, jewelry glass
Commission the mass, to stop the record, pa, switch states, yo
Real niggas get big, fake niggas get hit
Talk about bitches won't come to your shit
I'm throwing on balley's, laying in denalli's
On my way to Cali, fuck niggas I respect, gun playing the slip

Aiyo, I sing liver than the Tempts, sitting in the V, choking my hat down
Everybody fly, folding bricks
Once my niggas get on, it's on, I'm popping niggas off top
This is my yacht, stay the fuck off
Ya'll ran with the Cuban, started changing names, nigga listen
I started it, you need to just pass me the chain
Don't give me that ""I respect your work"" bullshit
I shot the same game, shot niggas in planes and stole niggas wizzes
Yo, that's my ninjas, catching bodies a hobby
Sit back, doola hits, more, listen
Twisting, wrist glisten, slang lord, handle my position
Is to sit back, and kill all fake niggas
And I sware my ear is the rear version
Don't got time to kill on every track, fuck rap, change the wheel
Kneel behind 'burbans, and burst one knee, this is me
All the kid ever wanted was more burners

Jog through the back of the building, drop the L

Extease, the G-500, blunted, we sittin' like Indians
East pipe knife in the sock
Everybody gather 'round, here's a new ruler in town
Shout out to legend Rick, jewelin' me down
Bricks of ice, hundred bags smoking 'em pipes
Live out the large shit, in the garage, all night
Check out the killings, mac 10, action packed gats
And gorillas play the store yo, with urgency crack
Guess down, stone wash in Austin
Every burner bloody yo, every nigga ain't gully, he wack
I stand on the throne, crack slingin', huddled with chrome
Looking just like daddy came home, yo give me dap, come on
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
Aiyo, I'mma leave the ish bent, been awoke
Can't none of ya'll handle the nigga, even if I went broke
I still eat good, the feet fleets, movin' in jeeps
Or we good, that nigga fronted, catch a hundred shots with equal
Extra sneaky, get me a release piece, freak me
Got the Jodeci joint rockin', doin' it unique featuring
Flyin' to Germany, hittin' mad hunns that heard of me
Philly joint, burgundy, ya'll hurtin' me
[Chorus 2X]

Hold the mic, I'm hogging it, handle the goose shit

Trees lean, we get it tight, we get fucked right
We up in the telly, lighting up with the crack light
My mind calculation, attract like I'm counting peso's
Out in turban caco's with some fake ho's
The bling swing, a many mansion, a break phantom
Floating through the town on some old new improved shit
Swerve coming through shit, vandals in coupe shit, yo
Animal blue shit, my scramblers move with
A kingley, getting blunted to nine hundred

Feed they nuts to pit bulls and plan more business
Got sluts on leashes walkin on all fours
Have 'em eatin from dog bowls pettin' they heads
Cause they love playin that role they sexy in bed
Smokin bud' I'm outta control wish death on the feds
Cup spills with Grey Goose watchin snuff films
Laughin with dykes that wear patent leather with spikes
My cheddar is right, Miami beach playin it low
St. Barts rent a house and a boat
Two hundred thou' on my throat
That's only half of what my wife ice cost
Phonecall, hearin another boss got his life lost
Well, wipin' sand off of my toes
Read a book called ""Catcher in the rye"", I chose
Some Bob Marley then I plotted a scheme
To make me and Bump Knux more rich
Then I got me a team, he got 'em a team
He tryin to buy G-force with missile launchers
Tired of walkin' around with beef, with that pistols on us
C-4's better I'm callin up some B-More killers
To come and bleed you
As sure as the sun's in the sky you'll surely die
You washed up, fuck your people
Your money ain't as long as mine you dumb and you foul
Who you tryin to squeeze all this fuck with Alzheimer's disease
We the new breed, nigga, turn up the mics

Yeah, you know where I'm from, I'm from Staten Island, man
Word up, ya'll know it as Shaolin, I call it Staten Island, man
Cuz niggas get they legs broke, when they try to front, man
Fuck it, he rhyme? He talking shit, let's break his fingers, man

Throwing niggas in cars, driving off and shit
Open the door on your ass, you know how them Pontiac days went

Intro: Raekwon the Chef
It's the remix Son
Can it be, act like you know
Check it
Verse One: Ghostface Killer
Yo, check what happened out of state
I'm knocking off a half-a-cake Cash Rule, flying at a fast rate
I smoke the black dust kept my hands clutched, I'm fallin in lust
Spore plush I played my hand like a royal flush
Baggy jeans, Wallabee Clarks, pretty woman
I put it in him, shot up in him, deadly venom
I hung around the big time bosses
Illegal force exchange thoughts, showing love to all my sources
Spades tried to bag me, like Cagney, and Lacey
Chef had that bitch Stacey slippin in Macy's
I dose off, catch a flashback on how I got trapped
and got licked like Papsy in a mob flick I got hit
Stumblin holdin my neck to the God's rest
Opened flesh burgundy blood colored my Guess
Emergency trauma, black teen headed for surgery
Can it be an out of state nigga tried to murder me?
I should've stayed in Job Corp, but now I'm a outlaw
Ray Cartegna, carry a fo'-fo' nigga
Chorus:
{Can it be that it was all so simple then?}
Dedicated to the Gods and Earths
Dedicated to babies who came feet first
Dedicated to Up North and down state
Dedicated to rich niggaz who sell weights
Dedicated to projects with black kids
Dedicated to man who build pyramids
Word up! What the fuck yo?
We taking you on another chamber
Word up son, you know how we be on it
Yeah it's real
Show these crabs how to rhyme man
I think it's time to bless them, word up
Bulletproof
First chamber
Yo Chef yo
Verse Two: Raekwon
It started off on the Island, AK Shaolin niggaz wildin
Old folks scream : stop the violence!
True layin up yo, watchin these crack niggaz
Playin nuff crap games for what see?
Back in days, crime pays in mad ways
Sportin Tommy Hil with caves 360 waves
And no searchin for loose ends, now flex 300 Benz
Mad 10's with mad diamonds
Now that's the life of the good life, sometimes niggaz act trife
I paid the price throughout my hood life
Remember I got blasted, now that's in the past kid
God forbid I lay in the casket
But now I'm all about G-notes, no time for weed, mixed with coke
I wash my mouth out with soap
And I got my act together, 'Lo sweaters and better
and fat leather, so whatever, bring it on
{Can it be that it was all so simple then?}
Outro:
Yeah, for real
Murderous material stacked up
Peace to mazes, for real
Meditating on life
Gold, word up y'all
Crazy fly, dedication, to my people
Word up, peace to all my brothers that I ain't gonna see no more
Peace to brothers on the Island, up North

Straight up, I love you boy, it's on like that
Word up, word up
Peace to man woman and child
Word up
I got you covered baby, I'm here for you

Peace to the Clan

Stop touching the fucking door man
You so fucking paranoid man
What's the matter wit' you man?
It's like a nigga could write for hours
And get real theatrical wit' this,
Understand?
Tellin' you kid,
I got stripes when it comes to this right here,
Y'all know my repertoire
It's dangerous, and the cats I roll wit' is dangerous
And they ain't your regular average cats
Here we go..
Verse 1:
Aiyyo,
It's all elegance
He spoke third power style high intelligence
A young man handle the game like Merill Lynch
3 a.m. breathing, leaning in gates
I mean creaming,
Selling these cakes in slabs like Lanolakes
Fiends beaming, steaming
Associated wit' names and demons
All apparant reasons
We live here the gate blew in a year
Sorta like time share where crime
Sport it like I shine yeah,
Rainbow dough was the emmo
So many flavours yo,
Buy your neighbour off underwater vault
Then I met him, Colombian name Flako
Had the whole block locked selling tons in Morocco
Wristwatch Fachera Costanti, nigga dead up
Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit 7up
Had a black wiz spoke German
Higher learning burning
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot wid a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her,
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass layin' like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renassaince
Queen Elizabeth aunt
Crazy swift Cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dying kid
Showing off her diamond
Flashbacks now it's me and him again
Last word I caught
'Put your money in we could have the shit bumpin'
That's federalo music
I caught the glimpse from the bitch
When she winched yeah Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow
It's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it
Broke the money down
What's the total count it,
No count it over in the mix
Day going slower,
Nope not time to motor
He estimated over me not being a crook
Count it over
Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him wid the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wildin'
His bitch is in shock
Start smiling and speaking on Valen
Yo wisen up bitch this from the rich
Immobilize the game get your name right
Envelope came hype
Regards from the mayor you hype
Fuck right, lets fuck this money up
And get large and blow outta sight
Wise niggas wake up
Dead niggas lose
Who you gon' choose
Me or him
You a fool
Pay attention
Fuck around meet the tension
See you in the next dimension
Y'all niggas didn't listen

Layin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who 8 hours get gig
Got rugby's on and 4/5ths
Attractin' them niggaz I go against, the money was his
One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burgulars
I heard from the grapevine mine made it
Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet
The game is missin' somethin' unique
I put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep

Get down, lay down, we don't play around
I don't know what you heard but, we don't play around
It's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened?
How you leave the dope game to persue rappin'?
Already knowin' that ya shit was trash
Breathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass
All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap
And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that
Uh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad
My niggaz set it when we get in the yard
Whether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock
Straight punch in ya lung and you niggaz gon' drop
What?

Yo yo yo shoot him in his mouth.. (nah)
Fuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the act up
Bring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass
As lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah)
And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?
My murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls
Not even Ajax can clean that, Jack

Many brothers I be sparkin and bustin mad light inside the dark
Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture
I handglide, holdin on strong, hard to capture
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant
Then I react, like a convict, and start killin shit
It's manifested, the Gods work like appliances
Dealin in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The ninth chamber, nigga trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway (blaow! blaow! blaow!)
No question, I send your ass back, right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwin niggaz off airplanes cause CASH RULES
Everything around me black as you can see
Swallow this murder one verse like God degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback chain reaction

I'm all that, street niggaz knowin my steez black

But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with Ghost
I max the most shotguns through the nose
Phonograph hip-hop put me on top
'Lo wears, and Tommy Hil fly shit with a knot
The witty unpredictable live shit, drive by shit
Do or die shit, I'll take your lie and shit
And then you know I'm runnin through the penal foul
Four-toothed child was wild
The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know it, one love kid
No I'm not doin a nid
Too much to get for what cause six niggaz got
stuck, and the nigga chain was truck
Yo fuck that, Criminology rap

The way the tech dance
On a nigga face
Son ain't have a chance
Seen him high pitch yellow nigga
>From outta town a young mellow ally
Trying to run through
Hell and song called the dogs to get on him
When we caught him the only famous nigga
Was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail
I used to play baseball wid him
'Til he got large son bought a whale
As you're by the entrance
Guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back
In the Acura spectacular big key stackeler
Seen a nigga gymed down fresh haircut
Trying to swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild
We walked by eyeing 'im
Shorty ain't looked
He trying to get fly
My niggas ain't dived on him
Kase had the mack in the vest
The way he moving might be dressed
He made two rights nigga move left
Standing by the incinerator
Thank God he your generator
I can tell bought his lady swade gators
Yo now it's time to move
Spit nozzles on the tools
Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib yup drinked
We at the elevator base
Staring at the nigga chains shake
We looked at him seen all crooked
The we flashed on him
He knew we was live
My man Boo stashed on him
Pulled out take of the wool
Nigga cool out
Walk you out the bulding
Betta run nigga move out
This nigga liver than fuck
Larger than fuck betta kill me
All y'all niggas is butt
What spray it up
Took the chains in case
Shot him at point blank range
He started screaming like a cave man
Blood got a salty taste
I can tell furniture fell out his place
Laced now it's a case
Threw up vomit on my Kobe
Snatched all his ice now
Chrome teeth boating of a loan key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail
Mexicans surrounding the Gods
Chill you bigga than the ocean
Slow motion play it off no emotion
But my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him
We might kill you circulate death
That's how the real do
We sat there 3 live macks of the year
Crack beers one nigga in the back
Washing off his trackers
Don't take it serious
Vivid flow luxurious
I'm hearing this'll
Make a real nigga curious
Friday my day chill pop
Leave 'em on the highway
Betty won't never fly my way

Check it, yo, yo, yo, yo
Verse One: Raekwon the Chef
Stand on the block Reebok gun cocked
Avalance rock get paid off mass murderous services
Chef break em, watch the alley cats bake em
watch the alley cats bake em
Four-nine made em, Jah create em take em
quick fast we reflect like the sky be blue true
Wu-Tang saga continue
Grab Myer Lansky crashin fantasy
get high fellas, stand by, 'here's the plan, see?'
sit back collectin' Tecs N checks and
blowin slow in a Montaro flexin
Beats break heavily word to INS bless me
Blow me like three bags of cess
For real from the Killa Hill locked and caged in
We're swarm representatives, reactin like paid men
Strive for why's, nine lives in lies
Max sell and enjoy the highs -- what
Chorus/Break:
[Raekwon the Chef] The treasure is the glaciers of ice
[Ghostface] Orginal man
[Raekwon/Ghost] Posess the power to hold G's guns and grams
[Ghostface] Caker baker
[Raekwon the Chef] Pull off a keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the crowd
[Raekwon/Ghost] And i'm a scrape her
Verse Two: Master Killer
Proceed with caution as you enter the symphony
Degrees of pulse will increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords being swung
Slicing with a vocal
From the international vocalist
Ya style is too local
To fuck with this
All fits of antagonists
No assistance movin motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperments
Uncountenance dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Chumped by the drunken punches that punches the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries start
Verse Three: Ghostface Killer
The treasure is the glaciers of ice original man
Posess the power of hold G's guns and grams
Straight up and down it's all good
Peace to them check castin chain snatchin gun flashin
Niggaz in the hood bubblin good
Analyze stocks, we'll be buyin lion heads and cloths
To all my house bitches, Starks will be home soon
I'm on tour chill, catch you Ninety-Six in June
But until then my ten-man team be safe
Chill on the whips to settle this, we can all get laced
Take a boat cruise, sip daquiris and max swimmin pools
Fly jewels Wally shoes blow stacks relax kid
black kids got a cravin for grapes until we get back
I'm packed leave the Mac that you're with
but whatever, I gotta hit other sides of the Earth
Spread Wu-ness, foolish, civilization's cursed
But luckily I'm born to be wild and aure-al
Move crowds collect twenty thou and then we out
Heavy convoys my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Blow like a steroid pat Dan's they're Akyroid
My seeds growin his seeds marry his seeds
that's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family
Chorus [all done by Ghostface]

my seeds growin his seeds marry his seeds

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing
Poisonous, poisonous (word word word)
I should slap all y'all niggaz for coming in my fuckin face with that shit
Alright cool yeah, go ahead man...
Poisonous
Verse One: Inspectah Deck a.k.a. Rebel INS
Poisonous paragraphs, smash ya phonograph
in half, it be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class leavin mics with a cast
Causin ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulta
Rhymes runnin wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp I sliced the mic from the cord
First they criticize, but now they have become
mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the rest is I, Rebel INS
Ya highness, blessed to electrify
with voltage of an eel, truth that I reveal'll
crush the amateurs who screamed to keep it real
Caesar black down hoodied up and fatigues
Part time minor leagues receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack, once I pull back
then guard you, and bust through like a fullback
Verse Two: Ghostface Killer a.k.a. Tony Starks
Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tappin inside my rap vein causes blizzards
Do I like the kills for ice trife like botta digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins ruins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggaz gaspin swallowin aspirins
What a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives my post-its hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breaking the album Thriller
Now access the jig who has bombs and rocket launchers
Float like dope killer bees is what I sponsor
Ya entrepeneur, pens and gear like shakespeare
When I fuck I grab hair, collect drawers as souveneirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career is based on guns, throwin cats in wheelchairs
Etcetera, damage any lame ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken and passed like leathers
Whatever hot hardheads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter ya feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Blew my family overseas in mansions
If rap was crack, fully packed I be tour cats
Tax the kingpin of the rap drug traffickin
Village niggaz get slapped in Manhattan
for rappin, big Ghost steps off laffin
(Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me)
Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef a.k.a. Lou Diamonds
Sit back relax, fake niggaz don't get turns
Watch me massage ya brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who is that?  Thousand dollar chains and techs
Focus, the brokest niggaz of life shit
These mics is like cocaine Sun, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts taste the sweepstakes
Keepin up on fakes outta state for cakes
No doubt, plus nobody amount, we making dough off of
Puttin fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up black, matta of fact just adapt
Tie up, ya black Nike's and tight hats
Corners, stay surrounded with foreigners
Whattup dread?  Feds caught you grudgin for his bread
But regardless, peace to jail niggaz with charges
Unify layin in the guard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta, with stamina
Clingers and gamblers, and gram handlers
Tical like the Isle, so God, let's get steamed
Infrared guard yo' Beem, so seek nuff respect
Rude bwoy you bet, keep it movin par shallah
Pro black like tar
Designin the fly shit and stay shinin and
the RZA pours more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps go to black
with 50 other niggaz on the other side of the map
Knew it's all good and all done what, we want some
Mike Tyson of this rap shit, pullin out Macs for fun
Verse Four: The Genius/GZA a.k.a. Maximillion
The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguin emcees, I keep em trained like potties
I bomb facts, my sword is an axe
to split backs invisible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggaz are timid, and nobody knows
How we move like wolfs in sheep clothes
Producin data, microchips or software
Undaground and off air, the Land of the Lost
Notorious henchman from the North
Strikin niggaz where the Mason-Dixon line crossed

Yo, yo, wakin up about ten kid
Jumpin in the shower, peace about to make
moves and slide like greese
What?  I'm all about Tecs and checks and nuff respect you front
I'm slammin you like the Lex
So now I'm out in the ninety-five
Rockin that real nigga don't die
Guess down
Drawers Kani!
But yo I'm makin a pit stop
Go and buy a box of glocks, til he rolled up and yo
Whattup Hobbes?
Yo, remember that kid that we vicked
He made a half of mil for real
He brought about fo' bricks
Yo, so now we connect doors, meet me at the airport
TELL GOLDEN ARMS MAINTAIN THE FORT
Get in touch with that West coast Cali crab you stabbed
And meet me at the bitch lab
So word up kid, we slid like a fat four to twelve bid and shit
Couldn't even rest, I need the vic
And when I slept, I dream G's, Son I need some
Keys roll self, call up Son
I heard Pook and Tyriq caught a beef over some real shit
A fake nigga faked and they killed his click
Gimme a minute and I'm with it
Yo niggaz done did it
Rock your vest
Keep your whip tinted
So now we see him up in BoJangles
Stranglin a forty ounce, with ten G's worth of gold bangles
Diamonds, what, all up in his face
With his man's mace, medallions the size of dinner plates
Yo, he knew we knew him so we blew him
Took thirty G's worth of jewels of that nigga
DO HIM!
So now I'm lampin in my man's Land
Streets is hot like sand
Jesus rollin in my right hand
Yup, you know the steezo black
Got to go down like that
Shallah
Cigars
AND BALL HATS

Bitches love me, nigga who kill Bugsy

Blow nine hundred, keep a crow blunted, done designed to run it
Done it, Shakespeare ear
My alliance is live and cut out, call 'em giants
Skatin like skateboards wit swords we all clients
Ed Scissorhands, three million fans blowin flow
Wit swollen glands, cruisin in Lex lands, fans
Many featurin, special effects, untouchable
Elliot Lex, specs wit the Wu Rolex
Sippin on sweat, ninety begets, scream fakers on the cassette
Gillette rapper, ill mold decks
We light a flame out, these niggas wit names, came up
Tear it up, leave the game struck, chain flooded up
Back to the essence, move on you like a smooth-a-don
Big stack of cream, Cuban on, blue Ruger on
Highlight only when writin, City Isle, sky lightin
Mic fightin wit lines, we ball hikin
What's the vertigo? Eight diagram shop shop Cris
The barber shop don't park a lot
Play the next tel, NFL Super Bowl ring
Hittin Cream Team, motivate cakes, I'm doin live schemes
Sellin well, niggas in jail, burn a L
Highlanders'll smack fire out ya salamanders
We most of in, guns nosy'en, throw flows in the convulsion
The master is Lex, bulgin
Escape the Berlin, start a war, associated, broke a girlfriend
Get in, hit the world twirlin, what up
[Chorus: Rhyme Recka]
Helicopter Head, swervin in the cockpit
Puffin chocolate, illegal profit
Heavy weighters cook and chop this
Fiends cop this, six hundred niggas rock this
Player watch this, this is how a thug locks shit
[Raekwon]
Aiyo, first representin me, flattly blinds, the legacy
Imagine in ya face, God, lace 'em
Payment be money they came wit
Drug arraignment, the same drug that be sniffin in ya name kid
Sterilize mics, ill nights, a-alikes
Kill niggas in broad daylight, Cassius Clay right?
Lampin in the Hamptons, tank tops, Solomon jewel

Battle my lines politely, that's like fightin whitey
Here we go again, Lord climb aboard, Stevie Wonder award
From here to UK, movin on the doors
Speak through Nynex, go head and rhyme next
It's like runnin up on nine vets
Five techs, still a nigga rhyme sex
All greenery on, neon lights, movin like Dion
The heat on, plus we gon, clockin the resume
You off, a day light, spray ya gate
Illin out, eatin grapes, yellin nigga Rae-A

Hey you know everybody's talkin bout the good ol' days, right?

Ice Water.. (yeah dedication
to my niggaz, I love y'all)
[Stumic]
I remember back when, a nigga first started rapping
Wu-Tang was the main attraction
Rae and Ghost was the illest team
Deck did his thing on C.R.E.A.M.
Meth made you wanna smoke weed
Dirt and Uey, spit with SWV
I used to rock Cuban Linx and go and double my cheese
Duckin' the D's, RZA was the Prince Rakeem
So peace to the whole Clan and thanks for everything
[Cigars]
Yo, it's hip hop/rap, let's take it back, 1986
When MC Shan, Marley Marl, niggaz rocked the bridge
I watched video hot tracks on T.V.
Kool Moe Dee, Big Daddy Kane, down to Biz Markie
Remember UTFO and The Real Roxanne?
""Eric B. For President"" was a classic jam
KRS repped the Bronx, Boogie Down, rap battles threw down
From the roof top to Polo Grounds
I had the big boom box, thumping Scott LaRock
Hip hop was hot, had shorties doing the wop
And my niggaz used to break dance to Planet Rock
From doing the pop, spinning on the cardboard box
[Polite]
Aiyo, it seems it's all good, but the block is mean
It's like, hip hop, showed me how to rock my jeans
If it wasn't for this rap game, where would I be?
Gunned down, dead in the streets, or locked in the beast
Yo, when Big died, that's the day the world cried
Peace to Pac and Pun, Aaliyah, we ride
Yo, I wanna take this rap game back to the beginning
Where Run-DMC and Jam Master Jay was spinning
Yo, it wasn't easy, niggas had a harder way
Doc The Roc, he spinning on Harbor's day
It's like, hip hop, showed me how to live my life
My name's Jason, but hip hop named me Lite
[Chorus]
[Raekwon]
Straight money, get a live lad
Young seed, color it bad
My wallabees red, the lobby, we graph it
Sell it, had smoke with caves on
Brushin' my way, hide behind wave picture, fly away sensation
Blast takers, be gooses, mad loose, come in the booth
Doug E. Fresh and 'em, Rick and them suits
The raw lotto years, switch up the emblem
More color bottles, gold on a nigga neck
Slidin' around cop Gallo
What? Playin' Union Square
Chillin' with you and who care
My first fade, picture me scared
I bet a high life, and anarchy, can't rob me, all in the train
The 8th baby boy, blowin' on yard weed
R.C. Tone, K-Pin, J-Bosh
The nigga Rosh, Buddha Rob, Black Chavy and Marsh
Move on, I shout yesterday's dons, God love and respect
I hope the dreams come true, word is bond
[P.C.]
When niggaz used to be in cyphers I was sittin in the back
Never said nothin, I just used to listen to rap
Wu was still tryin to get on the map
I was a youngin when I realized that I had a mission in rap
So I grabbed my pen and my pad, gave it everything that I had
I swear I used to sit in the lab
and write all night, niggaz used to make me hype
Freestylin in the mirror with a brush as my mic
[Rhyme Recka]
This is my music, it made me, taught me, raised me
Held me down, 24/7, when I need it from it it gave me
Put me on to the latest gear, put a durag on my hair
Throwback or baseball cap, Air 1's, Triple 5 Vex on my back
This is now but I still remember way back when
When we used to rock Puma's, Gazelles and back spin
Before 106 & Park, they used to throw jams in the park
Cheeba got sparked after dark, twisted in bamboo paper
That was when that battle between KRS-One and MC Shan was major
Kane was raw, what Rakim said on beat was never said before
The streets was hot, on every ghetto and every block
And every radio you walked by was blastin off that real hip hop {*echoes*}
[Chorus]
[movie sample from Casino performed by Joe Pesci]
If you don't have my money for me
I'll crack your fuckin head wide open in front of everybody in the bank
And just about the time that I'm comin out of jail
Hopefully, you'll be comin out of your coma
And guess what?
I'll split ya fuckin head open again
Cuz I'm fuckin stupid

Verse One: Ghostface Killer (Tony Starks)
Yo honey-dips, summertime, fine Jheri drippin

Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a fresh-water scrod, or may I not be God
Attitude is very rude Boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vassey and Lahrule
They call me Starky Love-hun, check the strategy
By any means, Shirley Temple cross was done by Billie Jean's
Black Misses America, your name is Erica, right true
Lazy eyeball, small piece, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smellin like cinnamon
Excuse me hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
God damn, backyard's bangin like a Benz-y
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spudz McKenzie
I'm high powered put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week, but uhh

Straight out the bottle, but that ain't lady-like

So everytime I see your girlfriend, never confuse you
With the next down-ass chick, that play a part
That's cool enough to pardon my French menage a trois

But I know a spot to kick your heels off

Pussy monkeys holdin' my cock, just like it's vice grips
Part down the crack of your ass, your frame is priceless
Butter-butter caramel swirl, chocolate chip
French vanilla sundae girls, banana split
Cum drip down in your chin, right on your soft tits
Put your hand gently in mine, give me a soft kiss
What's really good? Girl, slip me your number
You blowin' up, and your lookin' Ice Cream this summer

It's Wally boys, faggot, ever heard of the classic?
Ever got lost in the money store and broken wrist stackin' shit?
I'm flyer than most of ya writers on my off day
Get off Rae, drink dick, ya wack, spit fire
[Chorus 2X]
[Rhyme Recka]
This is for the invincible principal, slap rappers non-sensible
In any language death threat is comprehandable
Indivisible, chest manuevers, I walk through the
Triangles of Bermuda to expand in the sewers
Rap computer insert data, text message
Fiber optic lazers, for all players, we uniform
Strong arm poetic artform, I brainstorm
Rain, hail, snow, earthquake, flows, El Ninos
Monsoons, hurricane warnings, typhoons are harpoons
Sharks that bite darts wit my tunes
Knife wound ya whole rap platoon wit one loop
My grand crew magnificent with offense
Intense, freestyle rhymes my sixth sense
I invent, Recka been a bomb M.C. since
[Interlude: Raekwon]
Yo, what's, yo, what's
Come on man, why you stop man?
What's the problem?

Nothing but big gooses in here, kid...
[Raekwon]
Rock your ship, black, million dollar man march rap
Physically strapped, electrifying gats, flying at
Rap herbals with verbals, kingpin's swerve out
Styles 360 degrees, don't blur out
Pass the word out, we don't bring dirt out
Yo, swerving out, mass murder route, blaow
Get up and work now, ya'll niggas feel jerk now
Take your money back, fuck yours, I'm lookin' truck, still broke down
Pass the smoke out, fly steaming hat, choked down
Hailing from the throat down, six hundred dollar coke, baow!
Last quote now, the don, Lexy float now
Hope now, Atlanta big boat style, we float now
Twist the flow Nile, the bitch tore down
Get it right, the wrist roll down, fly sneaker nigga, low down
Go down, lady dry ya blower out, casarole role, roll out
The jack star, track, fold out
Bone out, pound and a half'll blown out
Half the bone out, halfway home, it's on now
[Chorus: Raekwon]
Aiyo, cats be telling on kids, now that's a lie, son
Cats be telling on kids, do or die, son
Cats that run with you, dumb out, puff blunts with you
Cats be telling on kids, now that ain't love son
Cats be feeling you, then what, be grilling you
Cats be fronting on kids, Lex, you live, son
[Raekwon]
Learn how to bust these, gemmed out, yo Killa lust these
Try not to trust these, I'm six Guyanese, dust these
Set up to fuck these, good luck, trees rolling out with rugbies
You love these, certified thugs, blowing up g's
We all that, commissioner don rap, with the arm at
Set up saloons, bring pawns where we want at
Reward that, Oscar Award, applaud that
We like Hardcastle and McCormack, set up the floor mat
Splash four hat, Similac cats, tour rap
Faggot-ville, where other reals won't ball at
React tours that, Hillfinger drawers, Wu hat
Relax do that, whoever boo trash, two at
Beige or blue hat, suede wally shoe, lashin' Clue at
White folks, come out your night clothes, sliding through that

Kidz from the Hood is more dangerous
Everybody vest up, all the shot callers with aim, stick
From three pound, automatic is nasty, raspberry color
My shit bloody, with mud on my New Balance
Goodness gracious, more lazers, watch my family
Had these niggas, these niggas got more Rae shit
Three sixty weight, put somethin' in the air
He didn't die, but he coped the hearing aid, son
New shit, New Balance click, true blue sixes burst
The nurses in the joint, who school ninja's
The next paragraph might excite you, enlighten you
To get up, get hype a little, bust rifles through him
I wrote it like that, to rock wigs, ox' kids
Boxes, cops is chasin' niggas to cribs
Vision the next verse is classy, ask me
How these young niggas get money, the tongue speaks so raspy, yo
[Why]
I'm here to teach these niggas how to, handle the pot, like
Scramble the rock, dog, I'm hurtin' the block, like
Dirty signed with The Roc, word to my pops
Front on my team and that thang-a-rang, my gang'll bang
My life is like a horror movie, so ya'll can hardly move me
Come through your block on a Harley, sprayin' a uzi
Got killas on a payroll, killas on the lay low
Niggas that'll kill when I say so
Turn rappers to Ma$e, four/fifth tear up half of your face
Chef, move, I got him, he laced, broad day
Jump out the whip, pop your bitch, all we do, is powerful tips
[Carlton Fisk]
Time waits for no man, the clock is tickin'
Still bubble crack, watch the little man from the kitchen
Guns in the closet, packs in the Ac' for pitching
Haters can't stop a prophet, march and start snitchin'
Rims spinnin', Loose Linx came expensive
No cars we movin' in, lease to rent it
Dangerous ground, guerilla nigga shakin' it down
Escape from N.Y., we paintin' the town
Actual fact, Carlton Fisk, the fugitive's back
Breakin' bread with made men, so look for the silence of mayhem
[La Banga]
Yo, I was down, I was up, now it's back to me, back down
These cutthroat niggas, had made me step up my cracks now
They ran with my secrets, I would tell them, they watch it
And they peep it, a lot of them niggas came from under me, and
Those be the ones most defective
To build a sick strategy on rapping method, give 'em E for effort
Gotta send 'em a message, without talkin' that shit could get hectic
Money first, and friendship is second
Superior's La, inferior's ya'll
Don't make me worry it, ya'll, cut friendship ain't necessary at all
Get down or lay down, I'm suggestin' a call
I got drugs and I'm gettin' them all
I still got a lot of problems on my chest, and I'm gettin' 'em off
I suppose that ya'll know that though
So when I get paid, escape a payback, like I owed that dough

Good lookin' Rae that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
(It's all good don't worry about it)
You feel what I'm sayin'? (Don't worry about it)
Yeah (Word up, let's go)
You know how we gotta come at this niggas, man
Yeah.. come on.. yo.
[Havoc]
Stuck, y'all like gum underneath my kicks
Better move little fucks when the heat I'll spit
The hammer clap like the ass on a meat-out chick
Dump clips like a trifflin' ass bitch to drop
If you short you're a chance in the box
But I ain't lettin' you play with the guns in the club, I'm boothin' the ox
Got my eyes on the ho's and I'm a peripheral
Got you cowards poppin' that Moe', my hand on the 'istol
Wild out, have a ball, you could drink 'til you 'url
Thought the Firewater was strong, the pound'll leave you curled
on the floor, like a new born baby, God
What you mean ""Is he dead?"", what type of shit is leakin' out of his head?
When you cowards see the drama and it come to a head
I'm hittin' Rae up on the jacket, it ain't much to be said
If it's on, go without sayin' somethin', deliverin'
Visa verca, this is Havoc, baby, we those niggas (we those niggas)
[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
All that money is us, now what's fuckin' wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them niggas
All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""
[Raekwon]
I chop meat out ya face, Daddy, gladly
Mad breeze on, rubberband currency and I splash ya visa
You know the code, yo caesar low straddlers
Front Streets, cracks all in the front seat spazzin'
Imperial wizards, Staten
Knife game off the chain and I'm with four hundred with wagons yo
Live wires, shoot darts for bread
Any map, I assist that, I'm holdin' it, all niggas dead
What? Battle for cake and fuck wizzes
We do it straight business, all mount ride, ain't no fake niggas
Reminisce, spit faces
Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list, Rae gave them niggas cake
Battle the gun, you're wildin'
I might levitatate well, I might take ya shit, push up, stylin' it
Oxes, reefers, police need us
The regime of Shaolin with Queens re-up
Fuckin' with the poisonous hand
Remember y'all, no commercial, I hurt you, yo go get ya mans
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
Eh yo select me, Gucci sneaker recipe
Not the S dot Carters, no disrespect but respect me
One of the top five gangstas alive
My element is just the Elliott Ness, niggas who hide
Yo I ran from some niggas that was police
These niggas heard about me bringin' marked money in, I had the whole East
I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest
Somethin' like the new haggler on the Ave., ham it up, pullin' haze
And all the young niggas praise me
It's like the talent of the Six Million Dollar Man, 'yana pace
Come on, banana squeeze, aim at these Caravans
Heard he had his man and that ugly Keish'
Comin' from a galaxy of hood, hard real people gettin' ki's
Fuck wit' the media, it's all good

Verse One: Raekwon
Fake niggaz throw shit in they drinks
Club nights we snatch linx politic, Africans and chinks
While World of Sport niggaz snort coke by the seconds
Niggaz projects filled with fiends injectin
Morphine, the God seen more CREAM, and upstate
Cousin Reek, almost got hit with fourteen
Chill Pah, the God'll be a Star when you come home
Light bones and let you rock my 3G stone
So, see cousin, yo I was workin, cats I'm jerkin
And uptown these niggaz actin like they hurtin
Keys twenty-four a brick
Columbians be on some bullshit, that's why Poppy got hit
Stay tuned, word up, I hope to see you in June
By the way, I seen your bitch, she was up in this cat's room
Skeyed up, weed the fuck up, to top it off
look beat up, with two crack fiends huggin your seed up
I took care of that, though, but don't worry bout it
I got your back though
Chorus: Raekwon
Yo why's my niggas always yellin that broke shit
Let's get money Son, now you wanna smoke shit
Chill God, yo the Son don't chill Allah
What's today's mathematic Son?  Knowledge God
Verse Two: Raekwon
Fly like cashmere, last year, my team caught bodies in Gravesmere
Hit a store owner named Mike Lavonia
Italiano, slanted-eyed bangin them fat Milano
Selling coke right out the bottle
Sometime, a nigga brought nines to test with minds
Crazy peace, buying keys in Greece
Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dope figures
Condo with his chick, rockin the gold vigor
Mafia flicks, tyin up tricks was his main hobby
Teachin his seed, Wu-Tang karate
Mixin drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rollin with spics
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Took sixteen shots in his fist to bank
And his pet piranha, he named him marijuana
Smokin ganja, callin his weed paisandra
Claimin New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like her-on
I can't front though, truck loads of indo
Soon to blow slow, his ass is out now, tally-hoe
Chorus 2X
*pause*
Chorus
Outro: Raekwon
Yeah uh huh, uh huh, Miami niggaz
Word up, show your love
Yeah y'all, yeah y'all, yeah
Word up, London, Europe, Africa
Word up, the fifty-two states, yeah
Catch me later, word up, yeah, yeah

Get the fuck up outta here man

And yo them niggaz got the big CREAM over there

Just chill man
[Raekwon] On the real let's go get this money fast Son
I know how we gotta do this kid
*shots fire*
[Ghostface] Scrungy-head motherfucker
Verse One: Raekwon the Chef
Lay on the crime scene, sippin fine wines
Pullin nines on, UFO's, takin they fly clothes
They eyes closed, we gettin loot
No doubt, check the word of mouth, unheard about
Guns go off and now a murder bout
I'm out
My raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent
in a maze and, styles blazin, Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in a daze and
rhymin, my nigga Lou Diamond will wrap it up
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Havin them poodles on the lockdown buyin me
Amarett-ahs, and chewables, stackin pharmecuetical
Rap niggaz on dust and wools
Yo, I told you, some kill rob and fold
The gold's untold, fuck it it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller
of the whole globe, god damn I got it sewn
And yo, whattup pop, pop the suitcase high
And we can talk, you can walk out the fuckin building
And get caught, save the fully inflatable
Rap relatable, drug relatable
Niggaz here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler goes to spot sellers
Guns and glocks go to niggaz who got props
on top, jail niggaz get mad bigger
And yo, mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to momma, this rap wonderama team got drama
Comma, plus smoke realize marijuana
Chef may resign to boat across the Farasana
Immaculate plus all my guns so accurate
They get CREAM and the cuisine in Queens
I told you, money stated with the night beams, and two rings
Crazy fat, gettin ready to do this shit
[Ghostface] Sniff mad shit man, what the fuck
*car peels and crashes*
Verse Two: Ghostface Killer
Who's the Knucklehead, wantin respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath
Here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask Chaz and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas, and place it in his face fast
The full blast
...
Then skate to the next state
Further upstate, I heard they got crazy weight
Bagged up by the gates, in crates like disco breaks
Yo look out for Jakes, give it all it takes
Let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo Blake, niggaz don't fink, rape his mate
if the bitch scream, for God's sake, grab the grey tape
It's by the plate, with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floatin in lakes
Drug related, paper talkin bout the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the Big C Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations Chef, let's celebrate and sip an eighth
Verse Three: U-God
The rap scar is on rap chrome
Put it on seal it on, we're silicone
Spark it on your Talkathon
This rap phenomenon, to word is bond to the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars tone, bar clones, war tones, raw tones
Blowin out the door, bones but
Your rap's fraudulent, float in these rap quarter inches
Reinforced with suspense, be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational
Fully operational, I got NIGGAZ here to play with you
You know the steez you know my whole program
Brothers from the No-Lands, all we want is the G's
guns and grams, livin fat like the Hoffa
Mafia, sippin eatin pastas
Layin in the house tellin the seeds about the sagas
Before we got Germanic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the belly put tones into the telly
Sucker tried to knock me out the box like skelly
I smoke the weed dreams I drop top two degrees
Honeydips spendin G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss, takin no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train, back of the iron horse
Yo man, knahmsayin?  Fuck it man

Why we keep rappin' in the slums?
Hibernate with big hammers, elephants hands

Tell the media we generation money
Both hands is clusty, but I rather be in Russia spendin' trust money
Feel the sleeves? Thats ostrich
Mutiple v's, my own company, with forty eight mobsters, yo
Rob niggas on the hurry, get busy, pull out them tranquilizer guns
Bye sleepy head, get jiggy

Of gettin' knifed down, I might pop you over

Civilize your whole life, fast, ya'll ain't fly, rover
Don't test me, pa, you're playin' with death

Word up, you know how we give it to 'em
Word up, what's the deal, though, nigga
Word up, one, aiyo

Aiyo, I said it, I meant it, I lived it
The legend rep, for all real niggas, on the set, don't ever go against him
Live for the action, a warrior
Wu taught me that, though
Now I go for self, Van Glorium
I've been carryin' on cats, I'm like Hitler on diesel

Oh shit! Fuck is my watch at?

(Nah, nigga, I ain't got ya shit)
Yo, son, my shit is gone
(Pah listen, I ain't got ya shit
Lex you sure you ain't leave it in the..)
[Raekwon]
I started buggin out, fell in the zone, half the bone lit
Passed off, rubbin on my ski hat - oh shit!
My blunt fell, my watch, you seen it?
Gleamin little young fella, he just had the stupidest look, weeded
Yo, I'm tired and stressed, hungry and I'm vexed
And I'm flippin cause these niggaz wanna play me for test
Shit fell off ya hand Lord? Stop it, I'm eyein niggaz in they faces
After that I'm goin at niggaz pockets
The watch, faggot yeah, y'all niggaz got my shit
""Yo Lex we family, I helped you cop yo' shit""
Then help me find my shit!
Eye-ballin every fake Frankie Lymon in the joint
Break out, find my shit!
Yeah, yo now I got robbed, I smell it
Mad bitches walkin' by the fella tryin' to crochet, bitch spell it!
Listen trick, be out, bounce
Blew an ounce off of weed in the bitch face, she pulled out two white owls
""Everybody back the fuck up, move!
Chef, you actin' like a loose cannon, Pah, with you and your dudes""
If my shit come up, cool
Matter of fact, clack-clack-clack-clack, niggas pulled out tools
[Chorus: Polite]
Yo yo yo yo turn the fuckin' lights off
Pass the illumin' Lord, tell the DJ turn the fuckin' music off
We got announcements, we want y'all to listen clear
We just lose about mansion in here
And yo eh yo if we don't get it back it's gon' be a problem
Then my niggas gon' react and that'll be a problem
Eighty-five thou' gone we got a fuckin' problem
Ain't nobody leavin' alive until we find 'em
[Ghostface Killah]
Excuse me, Miss, no I ain't havin' it
I smacked him with the four pound, bitch hit the ground
Then I stepped off, dropped out the shit
Equipped with the dipped courdouroy Bailey's with the cream stitch
Powerhouse biscuits that blow roofs off
Rae watch is missin', you take ya boots off
And take off those chaaaaaiiiiiiinnnns
The fat fuck thought I was playin' so I started sprayin
Chicks hit the floor, bottles broke
The owner slid through beefin', duke threw the toast to his throat
We brought the noise like we here to promote
My man don't get his shit in four or five minutes yo we're leavin' with the
vote
A gangsta's lotto, thirteen bodies and still climbin
Big shotties, bodied when they sniff body
We did our thing too we got to the Envy lobby
Our last four or five shots we see nobody
[Chorus]
[Polite]
Eh yo shit got real that night
Power grabbed him, 'Vine smacked him dead in his head
(Oh shit, nigga he got a magnum!)
Yo we all holdin', rollin
Grab a nigga, search him if he front, fuck it, blow him!
Watchin' niggas foldin
The bartender got a shotgun in his hand
Let off, the wheelchair nigga got him and ran
Surround the Don, full body armor automatically on
The faggots passed off the watch and gone
(yo y'all niggas ain't searchin' shit!)
Yo where the big mouth at? Niggas step up
Matter of fact nigga, lie the fuck up
Nigga tried to swing on G's but he a gentleman
Son, he dropped the dead arm but failed to see it
Two shot G's pealed his meat {*starts to fade out*}
Let's see, niggas tried to front like my niggas is weak
Corey pulled the truck up, C-4ed this bitch, blew it the fuck up!
Niggas'll use and niggas'll die in this mothafucka! {*explosion*}

Vision of break faces, gettin' money lay in the boats
Got big rifles, play the hood, ride Benz cycles
Y'all mens are psycho, Killah Hill 'ciples
More fly generics, money make moves, forget it
We got this locked since nineteen-seven
So many rods and weapons, ain't no more reppin's

They started jammin' in the park, just after dark
Two turntables and their DJ scratchin'
Words seemed to have an attraction when they rhymin'
Hip-hop caused the guns to start sparkin'
Temperature risin'
Drape a nigga up with the ratchet, less talkin'
Caught him on the 'nard, bomb like a G. hard
Explosion rocks the Promenade, I'm God
And he show and provin', 'knowledge how he movin'
Smift as the wisdom, move from my gate in a drunken state
I wrote this degree, adjust ya eyes in the light so you could see
Never fall victim, dictate the fate
Leave the bake for the snake
If he take than I take his head without question
In the one to fourteen check the Justice lesson

The Bad Boys wit' me ain't Will or Martin
Feel what I'm droppin', I spit the ill doctrine
Spot him deep in the Killah Hill poppin'
Two feet dug in the dirt, up to the skirt
Spectator on the sideline lovin' the work
And my team ain't ya' average, CREAM we handle it
Fiends seekin' packages, beams and banana clips
Festo! If you wit' me, let's go!
The nymphos love me, X-O, X-O
Boy listen hard, think twice before you get involved
We hold the weight like cons in the prison yard
They call the riot squad, we live and in charge
Y'all non-beleivers get reminded with scars

Fine wine hundred proof, spittin' mine at you

Gather round party goers as if your still livin,
Jump in the toy you copped, Turn up the system,
Let a fine line nigga design, I mean shine for the world to see,
This time I'm takin my time, I've been relaxed,
Tour, I took six months off, The games boring,
Really sick and tired of shit, Niggas is corny,
Why me yo, Last of the Mohicans, You sleepin,
I know I've been transparent, Catch the kid on the weekend,
Mad fresh, Nothin less, Come cruisin the S,
And let me build for my niggas who bless,
I know you stressed, Where the hood heros at, Shaperos need rest,
None of that one hit wonder shit, That niggas the best,

Purple tape come out the stove, I miss you Dirt,
While Wu still contimplatin our move, Bout my bacon,
Turn it up 5 paces, Niggas tell lies, Face it,
Rappers can't fuck with Shallah, He bought cars,
He's the first to put his finger up like Malcom and Martin,
Take it back yo, When I was broke, I was the face of rap,
Rhymin in a baseball cap, Coolin with my aces back then,
Fuck rhymin, We was fresh off the diamond,
Shake rock boulders, Them 9s, Airforces, Wines,
Dippin through liquor stores few times,
Slang get made, Represent, We like the few lions yep,
Now it's a new day big boy, These grey hairs shorty,
What you know about the wisdom, This is history shorty,
Now the gods back, Hard raps, As far as that Oz clap,
Don't cross niggas you don't know, Regardless slap,
Down niggas stop and get up all in his pockets,
Catch his ID, Call the cops kid,
And now we got papers on your little faggot ass.

Yo
Come here you oven head
Yo what's the word
Dred upstairs
Passing all packs escorted from Kinetta ear
Yo the nigga's name unknown
Kingston, had it sown
Never rocked the combs
His wig was big
Rob robs on the side , little lucky charm
Dred with jars , flooded graveyard
Brown clarks on
Playin feds in the shark bar (la la you ? ? star)
With another dred named Gov
Both diamond jimmed out
Rockin rentals , spittin phlegm out
Sucked his teeth , two fingers pointin down
What up bonna , passing marijuana to Tanya
CEO of Benny-Hanna , He fucked , sent her to Ghana
He's Benz nigga , rocked shorts , beige Tims nigga he real
Took us to Switzerland , dressed us all ill
Smoking ganja , rocked Anacondas , on next border Elantra
Sent it to his mama
Now that's a major move , the nigga love family
wouldn't hand me no drugs , showed me his jammi
Bulldog Stanley
Flexin on kinal , sit down , do it Chinese style
On graduation day he threw me a towel
He came through , heavy like fuck , suit flammable
Ill pair of gators he copped in Beirut
Had his man wit him , just stare , don't stand wit him
If assassination strike , he gotta make plans wit him
Roll a joint , keep him on point ?Don Troing poing coin?
Freaked it , members like that I wanna join
The next day I heard he got knocked , fucked me all up
We felt it on the block , let the seeds rock
Peep what the nigga got rocked for
Smuggling dust in Rushmore , four more he went to war for
Moral of the storo ,conspiracy smacked mortals
I'm outta here showin love like Zorro

You know God, I just been, youknowhatI'msayin?
Doin my regular thing man
So I'ma get back up with you though baby
KnowhatI'msayin?  You know you my nigga kid
I'ma always come through for you baby
Yo man, you gotta understand, this shit is real though man
All the time, word
Yo man, that's you man
Yo peace Rae, peace God!
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Whassup baby?  God damn, look at you man
Damn God, I got a shit out you man
Man, I done watched you man, since you was a little crumbsnatcher
A little weed-hopper running around here man
Look at you baby, you look good
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
Understand, I watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations
But you know something, like I used to always tell you baby
A good listener's a good learner
(G-O-D's my reality)
I see you listened VERY well, understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is coming baby
See sometime, it could be like, a rear view
YouknowhatI'msayin?  And people don't know when their blessing comes
But I watch you grow, man you is a very intelligent man
Man, I watched you when I used to sit down and you would
trick me out my money shootin dice, niggaz is you crazy?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
(G-O-D's my reality)
Crazy you crazy man
Yo Rae, you remember that shit man?
When we used to be down there in the hills and shit man?
(I'm elevating strong I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
And you'd catch it, from Old Man Freed
He'd be yelling ""You little slick ass""
Ha ha ha ha
Talk to me baby, knowhatI'msayin?
Ha ha ha ha
I've been through all them things, man I'm watchin you growin
But remember one thing Rae like I used to tell you
The child you was is making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from baby
You DAMN sure know that you don't know where you going
Can you see what I'm saying?
Know which way you travelling
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
You understand?  And follow that destiny, follow the light
And it'll set you free
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
Cause I've watched you baby
You my main man
Yeah
(We're elevating strong and we're going on to the highest degree)
Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and, gun shots start to click the block's duckin
Could it be, and would it be, that we was babies
Catchin, rabies, niggaz seem to act crazy
Day one, in my spot July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin up Devines hittin them with nines
I was toxie, from layin up in Roxie's all night
This nigga bust a shot, lick my man's wife
It was havoc I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though, then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin to war, you know we headed to the floor
He woulda, did it, for me fuck it, let's mosie
Schemin dough, with the P.L.O., wrapped on tight
Sayin in my mic ""Yo we gotta go""
My first impression was to add some lessons
Question, one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session?
He replied and rocked the green eye
And yo, he started, yellin ""Them niggaz sellin two for fives!""
But he's a goner and I got my corner
What, I'm feedin my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Yeah, Rae baby
Feedin my babies, Cash Rules for mortal daughters
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to ressurrect the dead)
I'll say it one time, and be ceratin that fake God does not exist
(Ohh, G-O-D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, has itself balanced the scale
of devine knowledge, and it was measured by the portion
of solid knowledge
No man, can judge for another
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness
See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man
For no man is good and bad at the same time
Either you good, or you bad

Chill, nigga, chill.
Get some rest, man, come on, man
Stop playin' wit' me, man
(ohhhhhhh ohhhhhhh ohhhhh)
[Chorus: Tekitha]
Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another
[Raekwon]
Broke the top of goose-down sheets, kissed her on the neck
Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet
Felt like a King who had a Queen want him
I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick
On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind
A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind
Sayin', ""Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge""
You stay three forths and I'ma wiz you
[Tekitha]
Months ago.. you came to me
Told me... love me forever
See.. time has passed.. and lonely days
Have rid his head now.. stormy weather
But out of the rain.. came some delight
I ain't ashamed.. I know that it's right
The way that I'm feelin'..
He touches me.. in ways I like
Says things you won't.. won't day or night
Givin' me healin.. I'm leavin'
cuz you wanted to know.. that is the reason
[Chorus]
[Tekitha]
The only set back in my state of grace
Is that.. the love is real.. for you and him
In different ways.. and.
You're out in space.. yes here on Earth it's fun to play
I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray
And he gives what I need.
Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please""
That's a waste of my breath
It's funny to me.. that you get upset
And I told you quite often
I'ma fill up the space.. did ya think I was talkin'
out the side of my neck..
You left me alone, what did you expect?
[Chorus]
[Raekwon]
I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid
I'm terrified, shorty was deep
I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab
Like a Count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo
She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke
We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float
We split real bread, we was large
We had our weddin' in the garage
And then she stopped reviewin' my bars
Hold up

Moving through the city getting thousands
Digging them wallets, slide in to Olive Garden, wilding
Fourty cal's and eagles, buying teeth, gleamy on the set
Fly to Union Square, we legal, pussy niggaz jet
The old code better blow to the death, get ya niggaz out the yard
No behind bars, we buying niggaz jets
It's just a movement that came right out of a blueprint
Two bents, this is how real we gotta roll, think Cuban hit
This is how a general remains, always be a soldier, don't tell
When real niggaz die in reign, while we come blow shit now
Moving in them fly roses, it's all old to us, dick, rubbing our noses
I should of bought my momma a plane, matter fact
Two helicopters and a motherfucking chain that stay built
Your son is your man, let him do what he provides for you
Buy you some land, ride for you
Jet to the highest estate, cake out and just bling on it

Had made backs, eight labs, his date was Miss Mass-

Jabbed her and shot her in the back, I can't stand the bird
Word to furs, I need big wizes
He looked at me, ""Huh, exactly, Chef go after big bitches""
Frozen burner henchman, flash the great
Lookin' nine on me, rhinestones, no, them shits is dime stones
Hold a million dollar pound, bust something, don't trust nothin'

The killas increase, he fell, but
Maybe a little bit, the Mediene Cartel will fail
Diego his horse, with George Young
Yo, will argue over large sales, hittin' Cuba with lumps, yeah
Call them niggas drug barons, eighty billion workers sniff
Gettin' lift ownin' Miami yo
Flips got bigger, makin' more trails
Set it out of nowhere when coppin' a jail, I'm eatin' fresh veal
Pa-Blow, the largest nigga involved
The arsenal will have sixty three hundred murders
Livin' in apartments, wild he violated flight a Bianca
Took two hundred niggas down but two men houndin' him
The fuckin' cockroches posin' the on six million dollars sold
We're eatin' enchilada, goat cheese pasta
Yeah we're drippin' it with more salsa
And then they rushed in, found him on the roof dead in his boxers
But it wasn't him.

Pit bull fights, niggaz is bustin the lights
Undercovers gettin killed for drugs - yo
Fiends is basin, runners is licensed to fight
Young gangstas chase sneakers and snubs - and yo
Elevator's broken, pissy stairwells and shells
Old men gossip with tales, you know?
Police burners with bodies on 'em, bury 'em
Worry for minutes then we fire them (blaow!)
I see firemen, ambulances, narcotic mansions
So melodic, rock chronic, pop tonic scramblin
See all these niggaz into gamblin - yo
Just give me square feet, uniquely I'm handlin niggaz
Done danced with niggaz, plus yo, threw niggaz in vans
Left him on trains, his veins got ham in 'em
Take a message, he ran, it was a quarter to four plan
He had me on the floor with my man
We both drugged out, scholars with grams
Tri-colored rocks, follow the hands, full sorrow in plans
Make one false move you blam
Eh yo take the globe right out of ya land
We broke out in Iran.
[Chorus: Polite]
Eh yo it's eight million stories in the city
Niggas actin' shifty, Ice Water back on the grizzly
Brand new handgun that hold about fifty
It's a new boss in town like Mauseberg Mickey
Eight million stories and six is from the hood
A real live hustler up to no good
They needed more yae-yo to ease they habit
They said we fell off, the streets don't believe you faggots!

Where all the wolves live, sub-machine guns and big beamers
Yo circle the crib, you see teamsters that try you again
Little niggas is blind, the nines fly out and slap a few men
That's mine, let up off 'em again
Take seventy more shots, the remedy, Wu through the fence
This bench God, lays in gents
Eh yo pop the head off right under the tents
This is more current events, pay attenti
The legend is here, as long as you know him he coffins ya men
What? Bulletproof pimps, big hammers, multiple flips
As long as it's bread, you know you was hit
Eh yo let that stack get rinsed
Play the back, sharp as a fuck, ownin' my own shit

Will block the shots, that's simple, I dented a tomb for style
A toast to the death of my foes, respect violence, the criminal codes
Hammer smack a nigga out his five senses
Leave him dumb, deaf and blind, I ride on rinses
Interest so tight, strobe lights follow my grace
Bang bullets by the gates, might hollow ya face
Me and Chef smark massive murder, kill 'em!
I scramble anywhere in Shaolin, right in Castalano buildin'
[Chorus 2X: Polite w/o ""Eh yo"" second time]
Eh yo real niggas get up, live niggas, what up?
We don't give a fiduck, you faggots'll get hit up
Q.B., what up? Y.O., what up?
Shaolin get up or get yo' ass hit up!
[Sheek Louch]
Eh yo I'm a motherfuckin' Nigga Wit an Attitude
Heavy gun play, cock back, niggas is screwed
Stomach wounds make it hard for you to swallow ya food
Throwin' Purple Tape off for me to get in the mood
Sheek Louch, who fuckin' wit' that kid?
I'm sick in the head, they need to make a throwback straight jacket
White tee on, a light G. on
These bitches you wife and the God try pee on
I don't care if it's a gram or brick
I'ma make it sell, get off my dick
Pump or the Desert E., take your pick
Money too long, the case won't stick
D-Block niggas fuck with Rae
Nigga act hard and get hit up in the middle of day
Tough guys and all that but I know that you pay
And I don't give a fuck, niggas better watch what they say
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
Body specialist, full cam F50 with vans
A pull up, do it to ya mans, yo scrams
If you take niggas ears, niggas ain't really queers
Listen, it's grown men in the town, niggas is their's
Fluck niggas, I cut niggas, stuck niggas
Come up, pluck niggas, pop niggas in chucks, it's business
You in this? We non-shoulder style, son, relentless
They four lettered me Chef, nigga get down
Drop you, piss on you, get this, it's official on you
Yo twist the clips hits, this was on you
I'm just a business head ridin' with visual
Don't force me to put out ya head
One for the money, two for the crime round up
Peep it, all major niggas holdin' they ground, get up
Let's form an army millenia, Ice Water!
From Q.B. to Y.O. with Shaolin, I'm feelin' you
[Chorus 2X]
[Break 4X: Raekwon singing]
We gon' ride for our team
My niggas'll kill you
[Outro: Polite *over break*]
For the team, nigga
My niggas kill you, nigga
Y'all niggas want war? Nigga pop up!
Yeah ride for ya motherfuckin' team, nigga
Death before dishonor, you heard me?
The motherfuckin' Lex Diamond Story
Y'all niggas better wake the fuck up!
Yeah, Ice Water Inc., you heard me?

Pain, time and glory, word, you heard?
Yeah, yeah.. my niggas'll kill you, nigga!

Fillin out tax reports

Fake goons with balloons shit it out

Superfriends equal foul niggas
Bar miss you'll flip yo
Aim the nozzle
With the head brace the bottle
Get your dang licked
Six thousand square feet

Kilo's comin out of water
Watch me slaughter
Take your daughter over yo

Well Fargo got Renaldos shit
Reclining chair

The whole block suck cock on a leap year
No remorse
Heavy plaque red and white

Bout the bitch smack five out of yours
Pens bleeding
Got my shit soft
Figure like Ike Frost
Icy chain
Cop and hangin on a horse
Lames laws
Got your name crossed
You cannot claim boss
Unless he kiss braid hair

Fly statistics lystics
Slang optimistic
Two bats a tie and a biscuit
Kissed it

Diamond on the wrist kid
Misfit
Bought it like a ten dollar outfit
Pop Shit get your house lit

Get your style shit
I announced it

Staring at my man Gordy Laury
The bitch bought'em on
She'll reward me
Flossed it, cost it, tossed it
The same Main Source shit
You at the ""BBQ"" eatin horse dick
Sneak up link up
Nigga tie your sneaker
You wink what
Speed it up
Caught you in that beated-up truck it was luck
Fuck page your uncle thirty bucks
Ran in your shit
Blew you with your hands in your nuts
Louis
Thats the same crew as those
Milliwakee brewers
Rocking Wu shoes with Kaoluas
Time for lotti
Bald Gotti here
Dont make me throw shots trough your body
Everybody out of here
Thats my word
God through Shakespeare 'ere
Take me there
Get your fastened
And take clear
Its so real we might face years
Cuddled up in HDM's
Chill baby on and a nigga here
You start screamin and your scared
And shorty came on last year
And lapped danced my man for a wack pair

My faculties remained clear
Pussy in a refrigerator back here

Take it off, sho' 'nough kid
Take it off
We gon' take it from the East to the West
to the North to the South
Show y'all what it's about
Don't make me throw no gun in your mouth
You know?
How long is your CREAM? This long?
Eh yo, his belt got karats in it
Swift description, E-320 nigga pitchin
Rock a raw dinosaur chain, hang to his thing
It's like, he pump isolated, still cashin in CREAM
Niggas in the hood hate him, drew a vase of him
Blaze 'em, he actin like Shallah raisin him
This is hydrogen, son ain't live as him
He like Maguyver, chin 4 spies with him
Roll relentless, desert that he hold is a gift wish
Shash the list, give his miss dick
Technique, operation: tech scream
Bet CREAM, them alligators jet like a vet swing
Nigga like Nicolas Cage with the gauge in your braids
2 cannons that'll spray, rockin banana suede
Suck this drunk alcohol dick
Fuck y'all niggas with hits
We bout to shit on y'all shit
[Triflyn]
Y'all brothas wanna call us out?
Name names, otherwise it'd be the best to shut the fuck up
Get pimp-smacked up, jacked up and macked up
You're scared and froze of bein exposed
I own Harlem, I bone Harlem, call me the mayor
It's my borough, you don't want no problems
I'm on now, you dead pop, all jokes aside
I ride the top, you glide the bottom
Pitfall, 5 foot 9, my dick, balls
Shit y'all, leave flat line to stick your's
We flip off basic and brace it
8 kills, 47 ways to taste it
Never understand what you never been told
You did your book bitin off of my scrolls
We hit man, Colombo, coats and hats to match
Bust off quick, and then, guns go back
[Superb]
I move like Arthur Ash against God
4 raquets, 8 balls and no practice
Every cypher's a heated discussion
The industry was like a beat that needed precussion
I brun the music, shit that make crews flip
State that I'm the illest, this is Q.U. shit
I used to heat-hole, now I'm takin over like the repo'
Bitches that roll, Cee-Lo that'll sniff a kilo'
We went from Frank's and greens to shanks and beans
Now we drive our Navigators to banks in Queen's
Y'all can't fuck around, your words ain't right
Every time I touch the mic, they say ""Perb ain't right""
But that's the truth though, d'oh, infact that's it
When they drop this shit, I'm gon' cop that shit
The new star, you want me? I'm at the juice bar
Y'all once hap' niggas, give me 2 stars
[Chip Banks]
I heard what y'all rappin about, but bring your stash out
You shouldn't throw rocks if you livin in glass house
Sneak your weak shit at us, on the low though
Where these cats come from, speakin about po'
He got cash to cop and I'm crashin {*car crashing*}
But half of y'all cats just catchin up to Rae' last year
Got guns in the jungle, call 'em Jurassic
The chrome, the steel, the 20-shot plastic
While y'all niggas cop jars, me and my niggas cop bars
Gettin head from rock stars
We blowin everything apart, I'm smashin the charts
How I see it? (Yo, how you see it?)
Chorus: Raekwon
Eh yo, what you wanna be when you grow up?
Yo, I wanna be a leader
Slow your speed up and stop tryin to be us
Say somethin always, got a future? Stay out the hallways
And get yourself right, a 100 more ways
[Rhyme Recca]
Fly like iceberg, nice with verbs, precise words
Bently swerve, hit the curb, jump out, cock back, spit out
Shut your block down, get out, criminal route
Gangsta shit, can't talk now, gun in your mouth
Cream Team killas, cacoon cats like caterpillars
Giant size gorillas, break niggas backs from the skrilla
Scratch, greenback track, Fed's berserk
That's my word, disrespect Recca, get what you deserve
Inferno, melt down mic's, millionaire in my afterlife
Broke bread with Christ on the last night
Apocalypse, sleep with 4-5th, 2 clips
Passport, cellphone with the removable micro-chip
Specialist, 40-karat Sicillian necklace
Matching bracelet, Cream Team crisp the basic

Nine before on them niggas that ball, yo
We takin over, prosperity up on the kids shoulders
Start namin out networks, yo, my niggas do the legworks
Got castles in Europe wit dreds work
Start sellin out smoke shops, roast ya niggas on the spot
Incredibly graph it out, like black tops
Crawl on 'em, my legacy and style billboard 'em
You small order try to serve us, born on 'em
Niggas stack like countries, trees and lunch money's
Son, keys, wallabies, a nigga throw the lunch meat
Half of ya niggas is dumb, not even knowin where it come from
Ya niggas dumb, filled wit ripe crumbs
Came to the session, glow florescent
Start lightin adolesence, teach these niggas outta depression
Hope ya feel me, feel me when the top of the charts is filthy

Hilarious, dope Carrey-is, various raps to flow master ya
Technition, verbalous, reppin, which words the murderous
Slang like slurs, the herbs is the journalist
Speak about new heights and frontiers
Play the long years, have kids in the stairs, stocks and shares
What, the shit, gravy when he made me
The beat had me kidnapped, locked in HTM in Haiti
Sky blue aircrafts, rafts, in Alaska eatin crabs
Three hundred and fifty thousand cash
Louie bags, take mines, take shines
Let me see how you accumulate lines, he hog it when he hate mine
This the imperialist, poison dark flow
Like a venerian kiss, who wanna go, yo, come up
We waitin impatience, it'll be here, right here
The belt layin in the spaceship

Yo, yo, the tailor made, king of New York, design ya walk
Blow the cape off, they won't let us in, spend the day off
I just homigly bless you, suggest decimals now
Divide 'em and rhyme, contain vegetables
Blow through projects and objects
Read 'em like concepts, get stomped to death, they be on next
Floatin, gloatin, hopin they be scopin
But I'm still out in the open, John Gotti style jokin
Suited out, gray flannel on the camel post suited out
Platinum reports, son, but mute it out
Still might upscale and rule the sale
Six hundred whale rock from bell, and still roll a big L
Fasionation tape like Matrix, opposite of gay flicks
Stay in the mix, wit flamin hits

Summer's dream inside
Of how I'm gonna get mine
I'm thinkin bou-owowow-out so many ways
Of how to conquer, these raihahahahahny days...
[You sang beautifully just now]
[  I sang for him, and he isn't here]
*birds craw and cackle*
It's going down man, word man
Sup black?
Niggaz is fuckin around my gate man
Word?
Fuck em... yo, I'ma murder somebody man
For real I ain't playin
Whatever whatever...
Chorus: Blue Raspberry
It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane
Insane...
Verse One: Ghostface Killer
The war is on, yo
On rainy dayz I sit back and count ways on
how to get rich son, show and prove, ask my blitz
Stood up late nights, build with my a-lias
We can pull a heist, snatch ice, or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes Leon, pesos made from scratch
but in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mock socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's, pack em in your square
and little macks milk, blast the year
That was Bill Bill, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base?  Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy Jake's, Starks is back
Niggaz want work, now I pull back off a G-Pack
Coke rocks, fled to co-ops livin gossip
Them big lip niggaz singin to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects overflooded with slow leaks
the fiends get, new faces get wrapped in sheets
I gotta get mine, like my old Earth, bless the cheese blind
Sippin on fine wine, the power of the blacks refined
(Raining) devine
Waiting on these raw teats takes too long
It's like waiting on babies, it makes me want to slay thee
But that's ungodly, so yo God, pardon me
I need it real quick, the dope flow like penmanship
Many heads get pistol-whipped, I blow spots like horse shit
So now, talk, shit, nigga, what??
Chorus: Blue Raspberry
It's raining, he's changing
My man is going insane
Insane...
Past sunlight, more gunfight
Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef
...time to get the feeling, word up
What brings rain hail snow and earthquakes
The beat breaks, cause all my niggaz to break son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once though, the mind stays infinite
Travel in the church, nine planets, in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu soon, and maintain
It's all real, starvin individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects, infested with rats cats and crack homes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake half real freedom-ville
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keepin my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, layin in mountains countin
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill Dunn, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up
Pay attention to Tims ten wins, Wu blends
Now I'm starin you, the true buckle up
Now who's a legend?
Chorus: Blue Raspberry, Raekwon the Chef
It's raining, he's changing             Word up Dunn
It's raining, he's changing             Peace to Philly, VA, these days

Insane                                  The sun moon and stars
Fly cars, word up y'all
No sunlight, more gun fights
I've lost him to the street life
Street life
No cash flow, no more dough
He's someone I don't even know
Someone I don't know
Rainy Dayz...

Gettin through those rainy dayz

Gettin through those rainy dayz

Revolution is a trick, be aware
Verse One: Raekwon
Yo, yo, yo
I run with rich rap cats who run corners
They run through alleys, navy blue Bally's at the grand finale
Still in all, currency catches the eye of the youth
on top, playin on three corners of the roof
So we accept that, jettin at nights
don't ever wet that, drop the G-pack how will I eat black
And brothers, flexin labels like cables
White Sables, pressin up, tryin to make a debut
Hard times, when the God rhyme, I maim the minds
because he playin mines close
We ain't related cuz he raided mine
They see me lampin up in 850's
With 360's, blowin like 160 sellin fifties
Due to the wicked, dice should never lie
Now that's a damn lie, provin on standby, man why?
The game, I mentally tear down the brain
Half of us'll feel the pain, big boy, let it rain
I guess my whole team is marvelous
Street life novelist, let it rain dunn, swallow this
Word up, so you know
When I take you there you just add on to this (let it rain dunn, swallow this)
Chorus: Raekwon (singing)
You know how to love me
Makes me feel so good (let it rain let it rain)

Makes me feel so good -- Flex my voices right, it's on knowhatI'msayin?

Guess down, the crazy new appar' just for the new year
Wavy hair plus, we get much cuz we on the air
Cristal whylin my medallion, stylin it's like city island
Relax kid, while shorty profilin
Until then, we got to bend with the wind
Plus build again, writin my friends sendin em linen tims
I'm tired of robberies, pornography
Throw a pair, Wally's on poach for live nigga pho-tography

You know how to love me
Makes me feel so good
Verse Three: Ghostface Killer
Yo, yo
Check out the handshake fake niggaz rockin the toupee
Frontin on me and Chef, yo it's dog day
Afternoon I'm blowin up your weak platoon
Leave you helpless, screamin from all types of wounds

Covertin concepts that will nerve-wreck in concert
Cuz I write, and blast and slash your whole level
I'm holy God I be challengin pros for gold medals
Whatever, still remain sturdy like a leather
On Friday's, get your fresh pay, from a better
represent, my lifestyle is in like Flynn
Mili-tinted God shit is very masculine
Mad tuff, Razor bust stuff with nuff said
Ex-dust said, now puttin heads to bed
Call me a legend, flexin with the style of old
Carryin loads of loot, mad rich buryin gold
Sabotage, thoughts of livin large any day now
The land to satisfy the whole garage
Back to the morrow, soon to make a novel
Born to be, sellin like Marvel Comic books for my survival
Beware, I'm hittin like a snare from the Delphonics
Crushin niggaz I be blowin like egg-onomics
Washed up, you're fuckin with a daily error
No fat, niggaz be jettin when they face terror
Check it out y'all, all the fly chicks, yeahhh

I ain't no joke, I used to let the mic smoke
Now I slam it when I'm done, give me my ten G coat
To perform another song, cuz I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up, the scene I wet
I like to stand in the crowd, and watch niggas wonder
Damn, then think about, then you wonder
Clan, they just rag shit, rip shit, bruise shit
Maybe that's the rap shit, I gotta prove shit
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
Now flip the beat up, convert it to a hip hop joint
Write a rhyme and graffiti in, every show you see me in
Deep concentration, swift like the beamer, kid
Go with the crowd, while my lyrics spit flames
I flow-tate the vowel, cuz it's all in my veins
Another remedy, fly niggas is enemy
Cuz I'm live as some rap niggas with energy
Now do it, cuz I'mma put the nine on pause
My sharks beaming, catch you on the side of the store
Call your bluff, make you stare in my face, ya team suck
Remember me? The one you got your ideas from
How soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up
When you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up
Bitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke
You should of wrote, because I ain't no joke

I was a fiend, before I was seventeen
I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen
It's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated
Peace to the streets, the bubblers, mark & dated
Cuz I grab the mic, now I say ""yes ya'll""
Ya'll yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball'
Come on, cool, cuz I'mma get on rep
Twist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex
Back to them crabs, ya'll niggas had ya'll laughs
And then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed
From back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump
Then this the opposite, and ask if another come
Cuz I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup
I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing
Cuz every line is laid in
Caught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction
Bags of pies, smell of bricks, kid
Vocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction
The mic is a draino, volcanos erupting
Lines overblowing, gradually glowing
Every thing is written in the cold, slick & coin'
Slide.. my thoughts'll glide
Forty-eight MAC's and knives
The invincible, microphone fiend, Raekwon
Spread the word, cuz it's on
B-E-R-E-A-L, a smooth operator with notorious crack sales

Cardier glasses dim
What's that? Gold around the rim
Hollywoodizin, without goin Hollywood
Polly for all, Cream Team playas in the hood
Stop that scrutenizin, naturize
See my paper rise, promotin it at Lakeshore Drive
Trickin at the shark bar, God
Make sure the collar greens got turkey bars par, we got you Allah
Rare start grappin the hair, playin Cuban Linx
Spinnin like the swivel chair, yea
No question
[Baby Thad]
The peeps flippin, actin like she wanted me to pipe her
And they got you jealous, claimin that you never liked her
Then I found out y'all was too many dykers
Now I'm hyper, beggin you to hook me with a cypher
See me in the tunnel and you trouble me
Get my dick hard dancin, sippin my bubbly
Yo, beat me in the head, talkin 'bout how you got a man
that can't get freaky as I wanna be
No talk, Giant Size in the game
Colt 45, appliance in the game
Tyra's in the game, huh?
Relyin on money, to make sure that my environment change
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
2:15 and I'm blasted, smack that ass kid
Light skin, what up? Stop splashin
Slang got niggas in the choke hold
Freakin their coats, got $64,000 on clothes, yo
Wu-Wear jackets and hats, relaxin, bets play that
Ping-pong champion cats, what?
Chantin out Walk Myers
Yo, the weather is nice, flex the Benz
with $10,000 in flyers
[Baby Thad]
The squellin I'm for in the six range things
Make the loyaliest cats, Flipmode do strange things
Switch like change lanes, chains, rings and glaciers
Stay phat in it
[Chip Banks]
Man, I can't stand them chicks, I dig for Vanson
Play a brother close to Puff is Branson
Ice work, gleamin I'm catchin them, glancin
I play 'em no mon', 'bout to bar dance 'em
White bitches with Banky like, ""You handsome""
Flyin to the hills, to fuck in the mansion
Only one way you spendin the night in here tonight
*singing* If your head is right
[Raekwon]
Dance turn into a romance
Dance turn into a romance
Get up, get down, move around, cover ground
Throw it on the brother now, you swore
I had your mother on the ground
High rollers that know us
Crisp pop, giftshop, hollas that rock Polo's
Here they hold they shoulders, yo
Lay it like a chain be on, we on Cream Team
Play on, with all grey on, flavor like crayon
[Chorus 3X]

A truck Acura, crazy, heavy tuck style, Dutch style
All my niggaz look rich, all the bitches fuck loud
Seeing a Benz and look sizzling, don't let it rain, daddy
That's when the reds get more busy
Hyper and shooting at snipers, bloodbaths, some, they laugh
Gleaming in some luxury labs, all the wally down, flicks we flash
Grabbing bitches blowing in whips, every blessing, flip up flags
I put that on my wallet, I'm great, kid with the Purple Tape
Claim names, the Louis Lex Diamonds and the makes
All the bank robbing niggaz pump aids, jewelry glass
Commission the mass, to stop the record, pa, switch plates, yo
Real niggaz get big, fake niggaz get hit
Talk about bitches won't come to your shit
I'm throwing on balley's, laying in denalli's
On my way to Cali, fuck niggaz I respect, gun playing the slip
[Chorus: Polite]
Real ain't real no more, yo these niggaz is fake
Ever stared in the eyes of a snake?
To all my real niggaz keeping it street, fuck running your mouth
If it's war, then we talk the heat
Hitting off, leaving bastards dead, watch his body collapse
And push his brains to the back of his head
And y'all niggaz gon' respect the God, and the word of the streets
You niggaz wanna see Lex go hard
[Raekwon]
I sing liver than the Ten', sitting in the V, choking my hat down
Everybody fly, folding bricks
Once my niggaz get on, it's on, I'm popping niggaz off top
This is my yacht, stay the fuck off
Ya'll ran with the Cuban, started changing names, nigga listen
I started it, you need to just pass me the chain
Don't give me that ""I respect your work"" bullshit
I shot the same game, shot niggaz in planes and stole niggaz wizzes
Yo, that's my ninjas, catching bodies a hobby
Sit back, doola hits, more, listen
Twisting, wrist glisten, slang lord, handle my position
Is to sit back, and kill all fake niggaz
And I sware my ear is the rear version
Don't got time to kill on every track, fuck rap, change the wheel
Kneel behind 'burbans, and burst one knee, this is me
All the kid ever wanted was more burners

Aiyyo,
Rollie what's up son Noodles had a problem
He called Lucky Hands lab saying niggas mobbed him
Max was on the outskirt trickin' in DC
Blaze had a shorty in his lab gettin' weed for free
That night I was in the cut alone zoned out
Suggest I rock a utility vest when I'm bonin' out
Yeah you know it, Bobby told me before
Keep the heat by the side of the door
Ready for military war
Numerous cats, niggas is uterus
Who this, claimin' that he loking for Louis Rich
Diamond a young king doing his thing
Big safes out in Beijing
Aqua green thing
One connect had turned on him
God, shit got realer than a fuck
Crackers up state want him
Marshalls came through the hood that night
Bagged my man Chaz 32 bags he copped flight
Now he upstate baggin' niggas
House and Air Maxs big ACs
Won the Oscar award for crabbing niggas
Now all y'all niggas get to laugh now
Who got the last laugh now

Little meek caught us
Couple of francs, peep the blue Taurus
What up tuck your chain they came for us
Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes
It was who I thought it was
2 pair of Clarks one pair of Lugz
Wit the hardbottom nigga wid the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there
Doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit
Spoken loud words all we want is his head
He did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now
Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit
Noodles caught the stair down
Now it came back to me yo
Handle it wise and brutally yo
Put down your tooly and talk like men
No shots rang yo, hittin' the ground like mangoes

Yo it's a new year, bitch, and I'm takin' over

Niggas, talkin' faces, soldier
If rap don't work, get back to that bakin' soda
On the strip tryin' to catch more cake than Oprah
I got clips that'll leave you with ya face on a poster
I talk slick and I'm sprayin' the toaster
Sparkin' shoot outs and start poppin' off shit the way I'm supposed to
You the type to go up North straight scrappin' a sore butt
And ain't nuttin' worse than gettin' shot as soon as you woke up
You got work? I'll be rapin' ya dolja
I'm takin' his pack and breakin' his back and makin' him throw up
Cuz the draft's like a bomb and I'm waitin' to blow up
I'll take cash on ya mom's and turn her frame into donuts

Lookin' stupid with a vest on, these bullets might draw on ya face

Cuz ya bitch said she love the way the dick talk all in the cake
I need this bank money, throw me the safe
All these killas involved, the cops'll fuck around and chalk the place
Yo they wonder why we hang with crooks

Green Araccis , unattached shit , 575 blue bals , blue bals
Bo Jacksons gray and black , ready to throw my hands flashin
Ewings, Barkleys , Lex use an entertainer , forget Air Cross Trainer
Free container , Polos , Mark 5s and the leases , the fly pieces
Shit be on the back mad features
Hoyas, caught ?? in the tonic , feeling bionic
Design it with my fly garments , what up

Drink to this nigga
Yo, what's your record company lord? (Gladiators)
Keep it straight.. straight up
Game time
[movie samples]
""I don't know what you doin' out there on the street""
""I'm gonna kick your ass!""
[Raekwon]
Wallabee encounters, yo we from New York we never bounce son
We carry cage ways, straight up and don't get down son
Supposed to have blow out and pound son
Ten rastas had masses, fly Nikes, splashes and Porsche glasses
Singles leather opponent, straight from the street baby
Polo jacket, baseball hat matchin' lookin' froze, dumb, unusual
I'm lyin', face the music boo, pendelum loops and swoops
Shells ain't nuttin' to conceal ya fool
I'm young but mostly swift from blunted
Think like chess, drink, note languages blessed
I'm from and era where niggas'll get caught for leathers
Shots are hollerin', hung knees up supportin' the weather
Who the fuck gots mines? Bringin' like Duran with Ross
Bet all y'all niggas are dyin' in cars
Fuckin' with me? It's like luxury
Flow like water in and out of doors, dare a nigga fuck wit' me
[Chorus x2: Polite doing reggae]
Eh, nah test this boy, spit fire
He got a sound like lightnin' and thunder
Eh, nah test this boy, spit fire
Honey bad sound boy test he get murdered
[Raekwon]
Yo, beat Gods, +Sneakers+ look decent and he hard
Feel my giants, sway down, big pieces on yo
The bringers I flooded with more dough
Feel my effect, Lex get busy, wheel his own check now blow
Mountains get bagged, I'd rather count and just grag
Slap on crabs, Jags in the snow
Feelin' leather Khuzis and Uzis
Movies that bein' produced like rubees
One of the illest gaters salute me yo
Drive borrowed connects
Bought out Manhatten wit' cheques
Man I miss you, bank's next
Finger paintin' low like one of the Saints
Jim down, all white minks lookin' like 10 thou'
Staten Island Gotti, gats, we ain't leavin' without it
Take this here, you need cops, you ain't 'bout to stay in there
Get popped and the violence in rare
I can take care of yours, you take care of there's
[Hook: Polite]
Word is out, other rappers usin' their clout
Your hands ain't dipped no more, you just pissin' me off
From a jurisdiction where niggas come up missin' rides, get housed right
Niggas even battle for bitches
And their game is to get yours, ride through the zors
You sure? Suggest you're wise to se what time it is Lord
The plane ain't the same, the game kinda weakened your name
What you better do is +Spit Flames+
Chorus x2
[Polite doing reggae]
We spit fire, yeah it's on and nah testin' up the wrist
Me nah have to touch in my wrist, son me have to push to waste
And all the boy spit fire, me lick a shot to retire
So them can not move no further
I spit fire, then me call Ghostface Killah
Tell him that me just start to murder
Me spit fire, then me call Raekwon the Chef
Tell the boy run for the lawyer
Don't test this fire
[Hook]
[Outro: Raekwon]
""The first thing what we gotta do man
is know what we gonna do with this +CREAM+ when we get it
I'm not tryna just be.. sitting on motherfuckin' 200 thou'

Storytellin rap Magellan I ain't tellin
Them niggaz ran in the spot for sellin
Word up, pushed up, man got mushed up
Seen him at a rap show actin like fat cat though
Glasses gold, shinin like a real big boy
This nigga had mega ice on Chips Ahoy!
Cat surrounded, this political brown kid
All out the wind yo, my man walked in
Pullin mints out son had mad clientele
Order me Cristal twice Kion, chill!
Watch them niggaz, aiyyo that clique's from outta state
They bubble weight in Far Rockaway with Blake Carrington
You know the kid with the most doe-getters
And terrors on fat shit clique they rock Lo sweaters
That's my man, that's my man too
Call him up on the strength of the Wu
And watch me game, yo grab the cell
I got a heist to pull off well
At the end of the week, I'm buyin you a L
Lexus nigga, I ain't talkin bout Hancock
No time for weed plus no time to get locked
That night, up in the staircase
Cousin had me laced out, skeed all outta my face
We gon' get dat cruchy chump for all of his lump
Don't try to front, you was sweatin this Hilfidiger
Guess who walked in - Abbott and his man from Farragut
Confront him wit the Ruger on his back, walk in black
Where's your man, where's the sky blue Land at?
Stop playin Wu in the back, smacked him wit the gat
(Yo, money said he be here in fifteen!)
Stop lyin, wait for the Millenia green to pull up
He got the Donna Karen shit on, two rings
Six carats a piece plus the chain swing
Like anchors on ships flooded wit all diamond chips
Back pockets: two clips - four-fifths wit rubber grips
Layin, two bottles of brass I was slayin
Meditatin, red dot be waitin for my payment
Heard the key in the lock, cocked the glock
Turn the lights out, dip behind the couch
Kion, gag his mouth
Infra-redded his head when he entered
But a soft Perry Ellis leather with Dorinda
A friend of, Kion's wife, Kenya, the bitch larger than life
Yo, shorty be fuckin mad Columbian niggaz
Fuck it, get on the floor meet the black Lex Luthor
Stripped fast, the bitch had on Claiborne drawers
Yo Rae, you about to scrape her, chill Ghost
Thought for a second, turned around
Threw the nine in his meatloaf
Yo, where's the cash and the stash that's mixed?
I don't know!
Shot his hand, he started screamin like a bitch!

Eh yo when you get some real paper it's like Vegas
Some of my people out here be like it
They call it casino a Friday, knowI'msayin?
Cuz everybody's gotta watch everybody else
For instance, since the fiends is lookin to beat the spot
The runners is watchin the fiends
Now the look-outs is watchin the runners
The runners are watchin the spot
While the spot is bein ran by the hustlers
The hustlers is bein watched by the dealers
(I'm tired of takin an eternity)
And while the dealers are bein watched by the stick-up kids
The stick-up kid watches the dealers
(These niggas is foolish)
The police is watchin the stick-up kid and the dealers
(It's like goin out and spendin all your money on it)
We watchin the police and the eye-in-the-sky is watchin us all kid
(Before you fuckin go buy a fuckin whip you'll go fuckin..
I don't even wanna talk, that's my word)

Show ya +War Face+ cat, gorilla rap, young Corleone, scrape that
Eight to ten bones lit, we own shit
Gettin high now, the mothafuckin wagon you was flaggin
Me and my man, black-down rappin
Wu garments, the renaisance blow tracks up
Collect stacks, pay tax, hear me on this
Bomb atomically, the Dutch Shultz with the tonic in me
Pah, rhymin ya base', Stat's the real shit back
Cuz y'all niggas got it twisted, let's take it back
When you couldn't wear that, holdin to hit somethin
Take full responsibility, ready to spit somethin
Just snatched you out ya fuckin sleep
You'se a fake wise guy with no personality
You'se a crab, Red Lobster style, no originality
Seen mine all gleemin with shines, all Benzes in a line
No Lorenzes hittin, reclined
All rich niggas play broke, the John Wu of this shit
Phone bowlin, dough back, stackin more
We travel here to the East, the gynocologist of freaks
Niggas scuffle in the streets
Hold ya weight boy, animosity'll get ya killed kid
Just like handlin a tit boy
All fly guys vs. my fly allies
Battle for pies, risk dies if the disc dies
Holy matrimony, paid to walk in the walkman hiss
Snatch mine, wear 'em like baggy pants
No commercial cuz this soul is strictly old
Fruit from the new to the old, better than gold
[Chorus: Raekwon]
What up kid? You're livin gigantic
Show 'em it's real, never plan it
Street Mic Mechanic
Take it back cuz it's much more bigger than this
Sicker than that, we represent ill, golden seal diplomats
What up kid? You're livin gigantic
Show 'em it's real, never plan it

Take it back cuz it's much more bigger than this
Sicker than that, we represent ill, niggas want the streets back

What up? Real ones ready to steal/kill dunns
Peace to Nixon, real John Blaze-in this shit son
Duff beat, autograph hat, sign my name in Greek
Gat freak, abstract mack, mad black three
Crack free addict, broke, threaten my niggas like Maverick
Only the signs, captured in the tablet
Engage in war, Pretty Ton', what?
Blaze the store, trap him in the cage, cock back the gauge
Producin waves, talented like Atlanta Braves
Made crazy for caves, rap Larry Daves
Catch up, come on let's match up, put this money up
Snatch up, meditate Cammy, hand me, throw the batch up
Track stash hatcher, suitcase money, submachine gun rap clapped ya

I'll be right here to stay, give me one day
Baby, baby, don't, run away, come see me
Some day, I'll be right, here today, just give me love, Rae.

To my hood, I'm always there for you
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, and I'm there
For all the underprivileged, yo we here
My life is all in your soul, daily, since nana left us
She took all of your blessings, cuz she been there
My life change, yo, could never though be without you, yo
It's strange when I want it to rain
On my best friend's grooming, we all had visions of you
We broke nights, God, knowing you cared
Peace, nigga, only for a minute and I'mma break out
Come back and kiss you on your feet, here
I love my hood, I love my niggaz, there, yo
The older we get, we understand, you might tear
[Chorus w/ ad-libs]
[Raekwon]
You keep the little young ones, happy, true
Graduations occured, you look so pretty and new
Look at the sky, all blue, all old people with you
Facilities mailing, jail brothers miss you
Wow, it gets crazy when I think about the money you made me
Slipped me away, but Jakes tried to rade me
Nighshifts, smokin' on spliffs, you kept yellin'
""Carry your fifth, the down the block niggaz is gay""
They keep police invadin' your space, we can't live
Plus, they gassin' the mayor, them niggaz wanna give you away
We won't have that, suburban people mad at the fact
That you be gettin' more company then them, they just be scared of that
""Hood"", look at your name, spell it backwards
Yo, ""Dooh"", that's what they yellin' in vain
You the realest, the most livest, flyest, you part of life
I gotta give you love, cuz you gave it God and life

Who ever said you ain't do right by me, they frontin', yo
They couldn't understand that we was a team
I used to come out, hear you words, talk to me, walk with me, brother
Cool, try to be succesful and dream
The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
Cuz she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees
You forget that, something to talk about
Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see
That's why I keep coming back to you, peace

Supposed to be blessin each other on our physical days and shit
Yaknowimsayin, it's like basically
I wanna hit my family wit like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dunn
Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stackin paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we runnin John dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry cuz it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up, do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she takin you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wisin up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred
The other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status, salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, ya moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum
Ready to haunt something, takes something of yours
Here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watchin how the big niggas rollin wit big cream, big schemes
Quick to flash ya gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be sayin ""Let em breathe""
The others wanna deceive, how we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We startin showin our asses, committing burgularies
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wonderin how the sword talk
Did he fall off? Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinnin on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sittin back on a better note
Yellin ""Peace god, I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable""
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good, won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood
Ha ha

I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, knawmean?
Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen to a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While travellin the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind, never ended
We now send it long winded, descended
Infital, Bobby Digital, Abbot of the Shaolin now
Wit knowledge and wisdom
The original sword style begin, birth of the Wu-Tang Clan

Couple rachets, snares, the razors and earmuffs
Walking joints, chirping niggas downstairs in the lobby converting
There's something next to live wires and goons
All in the sets hundreds to thousands, thousands to ms
Then tackle up the rims store, go and buy timbs
Hit the Popeyes, cops got eyes
We breezing through with nothing but fives
Puffing herb, we gon let the sun rise
They don't know niggas is slingering, what's the lingering?
Niggas ain't fiends, $400 jeans, cooling like it's England
Rather see me role in a hole, rocking state jeans and sneakers
Square sandwhich, juices and peaches
Not right now dick, this is our valve, we get down dick
None of that clown shit, we built it from a thou
See straight watchers, my niggas sleep, all of my unique poppers
Legends from the eighties came home, we got em eating poppers
Take money, eating steaks, being rude, feeding snakes
This is what get us all the planes and the eights
This is my land like Thailand, why?
Cuz I control it and I own it, But some say it's FBI land

Beautiful pounds, got the best doobies in town
Shoot it the fuck out, wash money, wipe the blood off of Benjamin's face
Defenders of the faith, measure the weight
Forever by itself, reaping pleasure from pain
We the best in the game, hit you in the chest and the brain
Now move weight homie and expand like Scarface
Leave you hanging from the chopper like Omar Suave
Ill Bill, suicidal live ayatollah, keeps it liver than Al Qaidia soldeirs
Sign in the name of Allah Jehovah
Portable wars, the blowjobs never stop
Freak bitches won't stop, snocker till their nose pop
Nose candy enthusiast
Bitches able to swallow an entire one liter bottle, abuser shit
We super gangsta, accurately cruising for bangers
Ya'll in the womb rappers, have to leave ya, remove you with hangers

I mean Brook-lan, a super crook don off the hook
He had the juks look, and he loves Benzes and gongs
Get wands, daddy, Yukon, grow up get on's daddy
Be sure, watch for, eat all that, daddy
Yeah, young'n's, supposed to marry
Don't play me close, kept the loot in his boats, he threw the toast at me
I wanted to be with him badly
Had me like a little nigga, runnin' with wolves, they all glow gladly
Heavenly, now he seventy, got rich representin' me
He won't throw me no cash, play pool, baby
I be like, ooh, no you didn't, baby, get drunk money
You'se a slick dude, baby, slip through, baby
Yeah, I'm on, makin' records now, I be gettin' money after you gone
He's a Don, slick Juan, Marijuan', Don Juan
Eatin' Caribbean food, feedin' me wrong
Breathe from the tongue, Chef you live
Make these niggas realize you gon' be number one
[Chorus: n/a (Raekwon)]
He's a high roller, he's a shot caller
He's a slick talker, he's a big baller
(Wise words he spoke to me, look how it's suppose to be)

[Intro: Raekwon]
Whattup gangstas, come on, come on
This is teflon right here, poisonous fly shit
Poltergeist back, add on nigga, live
What's the vertigo? Yo, aiyo, aiyo, aiyo
[Raekwon]
Chilling in the sneaker store, guess who walked in
Aretha, lord, Reebok queen, sneaker broad
Yo what up chick? Pussy dynamic, deeper than Titanic
Fly Hispanic, banded
Had me mapped out, iceberg down, saw the six
Then she broke wild, scopin' how the bitch get down
What up, I like that, give 'em regards
Sendin' messages to Gerard, who look like W.D. Faraud
Peace, how you be love, checkin' my feet like she seen Lugz
Ring gleamin' all on her mug
What up, wise guys, start laughin', pullin' outta pocket Platinum
Hand platinum, I stop laughin'
Rich niggas fuckin' had, figured it out
I won't fuck with her, warm blood, suck these nuts
Yeah, I'm out, spendin' off in a Benz truck
Valor look, richer than a fuck, what, wavy haircut
Met me at the light, wildin', made a right
Shorty violent in the boat, half smilin', with a gallon, aight?
Plus the queen of the tree head, pullin' over like a bean head
Fiendin' like a demon with green dreads
Jumped out, parked it, booth sparked it
Where your wifey at? Niggas like you, I spit lightly at
Quote my little cliche, instant replay
Could've sworn I saw a nine, had it tucked in her thong
Off convo, pointed at the condo, Lex let's go
I could've sworn I kept it real, but I'm a asshole
Hide in the empire, yellow liar took a glass full
Dick now, hotter than a lighter
[Chorus 2X: Raekwon]
Yo, whatever you do kid, just keep it real with yourself
Don't never ever pass off blue kid
Just better watch her, fuck around and be a nightmare
[Raekwon]
Yo, rainbow, glossy flossy necklace
Look perpetuos, ass is fat, butu look treacherous
Yo, where Gloria at? Monster ass restin' in Astoria
Black lawyer, she own a blow laundrymat
Yellin', I remember her, in December
Bitches maced me, stoled a half a million outta Macy's
Short light skin, haircut, hazel eyes
Nasal laced up, raised in caprini greens with Asia
Metallic blue G.S., dressed just bought a mama E.S.
Fuckin'n with some nigga, Louis Lex
He a rich nigga, call him a king, H12
Rock a Super Bowl rings, had a mean bilingual
Her uncle fuck Marsha, fake mobster
Tried to knock, that drinkin' cum bitch, blown an Oscar
De La Hoya hands, burn him like boiling water
If she dare take food in her mouth, spoon advance
Yellin', hit the mini-bar, Shallah looked laced
Spillin' Henny on, shorty just drive and throw Jimmy on
We rappin', ain't jack shit happen
Stop all this max, homey, back to my WAP, pretend mackin'
Chill, hit the jack for a sec, shorty holdin', wanna give me sex
Should I just, polly or flex
Yo, tell me more, yo, you heard of I-King
Drive a white thing, wife in the bing, doing life, a knight king
Yeah, I know the nigga, what's the verdict? So what he perverted?
Last word I heard, A.C.T. want him murdered
Hesitated, played it, grabbed my dick, shorty playa hated

[Ghf]     It's only like five percent out of a hundred
[Rae] RZA Chef Ghost and Nas niggaz is the prophet
[Ghf]     Do it to em baby
Verse One: Nas
Through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
to conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my Wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf I hold heat, nonchalantly
I'm grungy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
while, funny style niggaz roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Riker's Isle
Holdin weed inside they pussy with they minds on the
pretty things in life, props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggaz come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual
Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef
Perhaps bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin plates
In the building niggaz building, like little children starin
Them older niggaz aint carin
Sirens circlin fiends are lurkin in your baggage
oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork, crack cells bubble like Woolworth's
in the projects, richest niggaz rockin all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Tradin in they Lexus' GS's sendin messages
Two and two makes four, Cristal's crazily pour
Gun wars my crew phantom like swords
Verse Three: Ghostface Killer
With the green leathers, hunded pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jeolously Jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things, and it's wild like for war
like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks yo I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see Tupac
Got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
Shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops Bad Tony and the ball drop
In the Now, I'm bangin niggaz for slide time
Hurry up Duke I'm next, show em mine
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood, hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggaz slide through
like doors yo, you're starin in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin
New jacks surrenderin, come home not rememberin
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Lookin gay in the yard, and you got hurt
Flashbacks, of the day room, mop ringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed tryin to turn the dial
You told your boo you was whylin
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got drugs!""
Sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas and Rae got the best product on the block
[Rae] Strength my whole team is eatin off this type of shit
[Ghf] Word up, throw your hands up
[Rae] Good shit, nigga next time, no more whatever shit
[Ghf] Cock back the Mac an say whatever
[Rae] Keep your eyes open and your wallet in your front pocket

(Two) hold between me and you, these the rules, c'mon
(Three) yo, we got to stand together to take cream'n
(Four) without me and you the crew just could never be

Imaginative mental, blood flyin', the most hardest niggas cock they iron
Foul, live like a Lion, listen to the streets and your gun go off
Sorta like a show off, jungle way of livin', hittin' dro off
Lifestyle changes, niggas see that
They gettin' anxious just to throw one in your ski hat
Watch your language, yeah, you fresher than a million bucks
You got a new hustle, you hardly knew niggas would envy lust
They gettin' hungrier and niggas bust, they lit a bigger dutch
Fixin' them Calicos to dig your guts, detectives roam
Niggas come home and got a bigger dome, ready to zone on what a nigga own
Caught in the mischief, how can you live when it's a sickness
That sorrounds that projects and the glitches
Walkin' through the bushes at night, you gotta be sharp like a butcher knife
Subtly show up when the jooks is right and everything will have a major like
Whether it's Black or White nobody knows until they snatch your life
Wake up son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up!
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
The meat market pardon me, the heat market
Yo chill, we got it on lock, the nigga got to streets talkin'
I gotta eat and got the beast targeted
Relax, my Brothers on 'role, niggas got police barkin'
They want us killed, decease the sargent, blowin' each cartridge
We ill, realer in each market, feel them leather jacket, sleek ostrich
Unleash the arsonist, just popped the wig off of each hostage
Make it real and make his niece watch it
Yokin' Grandmothers up, we kill until his peeps squash it
Verse is somethin' mean regardless, a green jar of harvest
Just smoke, niggas got the green Garcia's, a terrifying team of heartless
Move on the Narcs's, we only on it for extreme profits
And anyway we dream darkness
I saw it through the Jean Paul Gotier mint green gleam optics
So wake up Son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
A message from Elijah's kids my eyes opened, got wise on the biz
Start risin' my wig seen everything I saw before
Had dreams behind a wall all I wanted was to balance my all
Yo make it through feedin' my kind readin' the lines
On how the dollar bill is shaped and designed taught from the eighties
Yo talk, build, and protect all Babies strong shelters with strong ladies
A nigga died, died amongst Daisies he did it for the babies
Thats peace, feed 'em if they gettin' lazy

Aiyo, soon as he hit the door, he seen me, I'm playin' the floor
Backward packs, Dutches by the drawer
Didn't want the nigga to grab me, yo
He threw my skirt up, my Glad bag, he touchin' my seeds
Goodness calm down, chump, you ain't the largest nigga
Holdin' that match bag, I still broke 'em off and my back was killin' me
Yeah, this niggas try'nna pose, frontin' with Laretta
In the crib with some hoes, yo...
He bought to fuck both of them though, call Cush and 'em up
Purple Haze just got rolled on, why the fuck my niggas know nothin?
Matter fact, I heard Thai Stick got stuck, they blew Black Gold on 'em
Plus your son's spoiled my days, yeah
The nigga robbin' everybody, yeah him and Keith, them niggas crazy, yeah
He just came home, he out in Ghana, packagin' shit
They ride inside of Ice Cream cones
Look at Northern, that nigga hazed out
He and some wack nigga Air Force, slain nigga, he ain't bathed
And got the nerve, yo, to look like Grady, God
They threw the brown paper bag on his face, the jail went crazy
Blamin' 'em, yo he was gettin' tortured
He had white niggas pissin' and shit, he left sores on 'em
Wow, what up with Maury, Maury chillin'
He in the fed joint, cousin got knocked, I heard he got millions
Tourin' with Yukon Gold, yo, they out in Europe
With the new accent, that shit is grown
Northern got his Lights sprayed out
He out in Texas, with some ugly ass African niggas, they blew his pipes out
When in the stash, grabbed Hash and 'em
He had a forty pound nigga named Brown, they poured gas on him
Yeah, yo, the crib got raided, God, Challish was there
He got tangled up, caught him and beared
Yo, under the pillow, White Widow, yo
She went to crack school, never came back, I heard she look old
Her and Cessamia, God, two twin crack monkeys, pa
Sleepin' in quesadias, Blueberry rollin' 'em
She crashed the ""Purple"" whip, Passion had it

Acapulco, Blow 'Dro, chillin', him and Satib'
Out in Geneva, in Cherry Gold's benzos
Corner Bud, he a real gangsta
Him and Skunk got drunk, they murdered a man with one lung
Now he on the run, yo, Con Bud, nigga got bodied
Had Jamaican niggas, yellin', ""He robbed me!"", yo
Look at all of 'em, Yard Weed and 'em
Bloods geesin' 'em, now he can't sell, he livin' with Trees
Afghani' bugged out, some Israel niggas rushed 'em
They kidnapped his little sister Pine Green
Word, it got deeper, word, they chopped Reefer
Caught 'em in the sock, some young nigga, they meat cleaved 'em
Yo, I got to blow, I'm embarrased
They threw Crystal Palace kid off the roof, with T.H.C.'s madness

Aiyo, I used to sniff ecst', carry gun
Smoke reefer, lamp with the illest team, son caught bad ones
Wild ones, caught a style, little bit of gift
Little bit of foul, never said vows, but he had ones
Fly sweats, hundred dollar kicks, run alotta vicks
Baseball heads chunky, villains look mad rich
Playin the block, scheemin', leaning for CREAM
That's the meaning, DT's laughing at black six, yo
So much coke in one bag, 'dro in the other black
Brothers won't share nothing, be runnin' the cabs
He ain't police, nigga just a nigga from the east
Redneck, heavy set light man, be ridin' the capri's
We block piranha's, shotguns, flash your armor
Regulate ground, on how get down, bound by honor
No clowns around us, visualize gowns and Prada's
Cats graduated, make it out the hood, and bounce on us

Live around killas, who more realer
Shoot through your after party, clap up your villlas
Sent through, ten or more, some with valors on
Four-fours on, I'm ready to hit up your whores, say 'war's coming'
Specialize in aiming, and we gang bang, slang change
Shoot through limosines, right through drink, he spanked you
Take the glass, break your ass, you was
Stepped in manuer shit, stank baked your ass
In for it, competition is nothing, I'm armed
Do you in like Jolly, stomp a seven to one
Fertilize thoughts, mad herbal in the air
Make the kid shoot this verbal clear
I'm honored by your support, thank daddy
Watch it could happen when we rapping
I be set, I be laughing, but it ain't about frontin'
Funds get large, or holding my composure, I be in the Testa Rosa
Blacked down, building just like the father
--instrumental break--

Yo, play the wall son, hold your ground
You know how I be gettin' out of town
Clothes get coped, close your shop
A hundred bored niggas, two bodyguards and a glock
Make sure nothing happen to the kid when I stop
Did east coast, west coast, we need to pull together
As long as you be real, and real with them real folks
Connect, make it happen, yo respect dons

Flawless, more powerful horses, the kid flow naucious
Everybody gettin' weeded, we all for this
Armored tank style, moving in ranks
Hundred that'll rock for me, still kill you, over your men bitch
Skiing in Alaska, half the man, half Casper
Runnin' with wolves, the bulls look nastier
Silencer, each is thee least, will kill on Easter
Ya'll gon' get it, wait til we get creased up
Nothin' but, rapid fire, livewire, brand new trees

Roof top nights, the booth, coked down
Air Force on since twenty two
Live niggas try to rhyme, but died
Off the strength of the name, on wack cocaine, niggas is high
Let the beat journey, we could all see clearly
Tweak through the earlobe, with peak of this shit, we seen years go
High times rhyming, so divine, lines that taste like spring water, shorty dope like a nine
Poison shot the lungs of young
Went through the barrel of sparrow, one who ain't hawk through the slum
Bums had no where, train style, one chain out

Heads clapped once I came in the door

When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and Honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name hon, hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle, just like glass in the sun
Never diss em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss em
Especially, when you're browsin, goin fishin
Your wasteline, bangin like a bassline
Physical form is well complexed
And yo, I love your outline, Boo
Your whole body is wild, wit your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strikeout, tell me what can really go wrong
You rockin' labels - Tommy Hil down to Claiborne
Show me some love hon, show me some love boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Aiyyo peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freak it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion, the shit got me open like dust
And yo, your stee is high potent, yo
We can go the distance, I put you under wings
From this convo we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked a hot Arabian desert, barefooted
I grabbed your hand, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it

And in our line of work, we need all the help we can get
Tony Wing's the name, he works for a drug ring in Central America
Who wants to kill him?
No information, say yes or no
One point five million
Alright, you get what you want -- money's no object
They're all clean, no serial numbers, untraceable
And there are explosive head bullets, your favorite
[Raekwon, Ghostface, (Method)]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo-yo, here come the cop man
Yo Starks come here, come here Sun
Come here for a minute!
Aiyyo aiyyo hold up hold up
Shit we gotta go to the store for more baking soda
Yo yo yo get your fuckin, yo this made of glass nig!
Get your big Adidas off my moms table man!
Get the fuck off it man.
Yo just chill man, pass the Cristal man.
Niggaz is greedy man, damn.
Big ass shits.
Yo man you ain't smoking none of that weed in here man.
Chill man.
Bobby Steels
Somebody go to the store man
Sup kid?

Represent kid.
(Tony Starks)
Universal frontier
(Original blood claat bad bwoys)
Chorus: Method Man
Who come to get you? None. They want guns!
I be the first to set off shit, last to run
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cuz he shine like one
Verse One: Method Man, a.k.a. Johnny Blaze
Check it
Scriptures hit the body like sawed off shotties
Like my hair notty and my nosepiece snotty
Fuck a nigga hottie, that whole pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mogabi, for real
Ain't nuttin fraudulent here, we pioneer
Commandeer a new frontier, this be the Wu yeah
Thirty-six chambers of fear, huh, you lost it
Information leakin out your faucets, hmmmmm
Time to forfeit your crown and leave the ground
There's a new sheriff in town holdin it down
It's the two holster, shit shot smoker
Wanted dead or alive, bounty on the poster
Wild in the West, a student of my culture
And life is the test, hold up
Let a nigga catch his breath, we still payin dues
And the last one is death, back to the essence
With that shit you stressin, this rap profession
Now peep Tical, the son of the Shaolin
Isle plus my style, Criminology pays
The last times and days, Johnny fuckin Blaze
Verse Two: Raekwon the Chef, a.k.a. Lou Diamonds
This goes for niggaz who know
Wu will grow like llello, lay low
Plus coolin in Barbados
Ricaans be givin me much shit, the dutch shit
Stay cool papi, seize it with enough shit
Back at the lab a, crack's bagged up
Yo niggaz act up, what blow up the workers if they hafta
Senoritas, fuckin up a storm buyin guards margaritas
Suckin his dick, up in the whip long
Designed for rhyme prime nigga jail time jiggas
Them niggaz up in Height figures bitin niggaz

Jakes beware black rap millionaires
Rock hairs leather goose bears blowin this year
One eight hundred gambino niggaz yeah
[Meth]
Wu roll together as one
I call my brother Sun cuz he shine like one
Verse Three: RZA, a.k.a. Bobby Steels
Solid gold crown is shinin
Solid gold, check it Sun yo
Solid gold crown be shinin and blindin like some diamonds
I be pioneerin the style in the cloud with silver linings
Double breasted, bullet proof vested, well protected
The heart the rib cage the chest and solar plexus
Castin stones, crackin two-hundred and six bones
And watch yo' ass get blown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with dim pones
The overfiend like noah bean green souls with a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard oh is it
The Rzarector come to pay your ass a visit
Local bio-chemical, universal giant, the black general
Lickin shots to Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happen millenium two thousand microchips two shots of penicillin
goes up your adrenalin son it's time for boutin
It's a mileage resemblin niggaz who like followin
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle
Verse Four: Master Killer
God steppin forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact
That I'm the Master, for what lurks, is an expert
That hurts the individual who tries to visual-ize under
Cuz I strike, like thunder
Niggaz couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respiratorial
Systems are fractured by the killa tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and glocks my
Clan is hoss and got mad moss for blocks so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of
The gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks pass the chrome
Watch a nigga get blown out his muthafuckin dome
piece, deceased, laid to rest
Chorus
Verse Five: Ghostface Killer, a.k.a. Tony Starks
Yo, aiyyo I got to serve them my way, move give me room
Holdin up your saloon, clean sweep, like a broom
Full moons make me howl like a wolf outta breath
Sold only new vocal cords I heard Genius on Gef
So step back, to the lab at, high velocity
My teammate, in here sells well like a pharmacy
Fuck Horado Pablos plan growas bravo
Goodfellas we know, best sellas become novels
The man rockin head bands, silk scarves and jams
Early 80's british rock, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with 8 million
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavillions
Them flower heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggaz get caught wit all that loot kid
That's jet money, undaground money
Submarines and rings too bad you fucked up dummies
Cosa cosa, come on...

Don't take it per-son-al.. it's only mu-sic
Holla at me.. yo! Yo!
Ice Water! Yo.. yo.
[P.C.]
Try me, P.C.'ll put a clip in a nigga
Fuck a hole, my bullets'll dig a ditch in a nigga
Listen, I've been reppin', only pack big weapons
One shot to the stomach, you missin' ya midsection
I'm off the wall, dog, I could off ya balls
Stick his ass to the rooftop, toss 'em off
Hit the Ave with the rooftop off the porch
I get money cuz it costs to floss, nigga you feelin' me?
And if not then fuck what you gotta deal with me
I've only been here for a minute but haters wanna get rid of me
P.C. creep with at least three heats
And a shotgun stashed underneath the backseats
[Stumic]
Niggas actin' like you don't feel a draft
You seen ya man? Tell him I'ma kill his ass
And I don't, wanna talk I want a mill in cash
I come through 'tards shittin', lookin' ill in the past
Cuz it's the, Ice Water, don't get it confused
And one false move'll cause me to spit at you dudes
It's Stumic, motherfucker and I'm pickin' ya food
And ain't no one out you know that my niggas'll do you
Let's spit on 'em, rush these niggas
and crush several fuckin', will leave a dent out ya liver
Only kid in the hood with a mustard ninja
Heard you broke down good, well I fucked ya sister
[Chorus 2X: Stumic]
Eh yo we Wyld in Da Club, style in the club
This is for my niggas gettin' down in the club
At the bar throwin' down rounds in the club
Talk slick and get the four pound in ya mug
[Break: Polite singing]
Yo I keep my gun on me, what the fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all touch my property somebody gon' die, uh-huh
This ain't no joke, it's for real
My niggas they totin' they steel
All it takes a phone call and they ready to ride
Get ready to die
[Polite]
Eh yo the cards are dealt, the words are spoken
Nigga, welcome to the Hell, the gates is open (uh-huh)
Gatekeeper, first degree murder through the speaker
Who deep enough to flow with the reaper?
Stuck in the middle, I spit a little riddle
Leavin' niggas crippled, my niggas ball 'em like Kerry Kittles
You niggas makin' it hard, it's really kinda simple
If a nigga gotta pull it out I'm puttin' it in ya temple
[Ultra]
Official I do this, rude maneuver
I use the Rugers to keep the bullets movin' through ya
Weak anatomy, fuck the small talk and flattery
Ya power is weak, to beef you need much more batteries
Keep it genetic, or dead it, Ice Water Inc. we said it
Whoever so-called did it or said it, promote it and spread it
Fake it or front it, get ambushed and confronted
With slugs in ya head, back, chest and stomach
Niggas don't want it or ask for it, so we give it to 'em
Dead in the club and let them things spit and rip through 'em dead in the club
Is you gon' fuck around and be the nigga dead in the club?
(Yeah? Uh-huh..)
[Chorus 2X]
[Raekwon]
Egyptian look, gazelles on, L's lit, this how it's goin' down
Ski mask, Chanel shit, move like a terrorist click
Nineteen eighties babies, worldwide, ya girl on our dick
All you know is Rae look good, he hood
Envision the flips, I make money like them niggas who take money
Fresh out the can, Duran look, Astro van
The ill Castro, rap Son of Sam
More Rugers, more bow and arrows
Still no losers, forty five dollars ahead
Go at niggas shootin' lyrical leads
Stop absorbin, break shit, knock that gay shit out ya head

Yo Fernando what happened?
Shit cooking up backwards
Light up a Backwood
Don't make me backtrack
Blew it dime it the llelo lay low
Saying in my mind
Fuck that papi gotta pay off

Yo Louis this ain't our product
This is Carlos family
Oh y'all wanna play me like a smoker
Coming out my ice choker
My man in the back, looking colder
Papi yo why y'all wanna jucks me
Yo listen B we got the best clientele since '83
Fuck it, pull out the pot let's cook it
Light the stove up
Julie go to the store get some flour
Sat back burning a big dutch
With the crisp 18 shot glock, stashed in my nuts
Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling
Now it start drizzling
Rainy day murder black won't miss him
Still I'm yelling this shit is business
But they still ain't gon' violate
What I stand for wid these drizzers
He took it off the stove run the water
Trying to work me yo
Knew I shouldn'ta hit the nigga's daughter
He mighta showed more love
Than went in the freezer
Broke the ice down, pour it in
We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew
Fly Khaluas is mad sliding Coronas through
Feeling like Castro's cousin
Gave them niggas all of my life
All of my paper all my judgement
It droppa only like an ounce worth
Should I just come out my shirt
Go berserk and let the Macks burst
Skate off body in the Bronx
Same shit Gotti was on
Shallah they gonna get your's play it calm
Seventeen five was the total plus the five,
Hundred for the cab driver that was rolling

Flakes try to tell me, ""Yo Dunn, nah chill
You can't come out, wylin out like that
Rhymes so vivid Dunn I see what you sayin""
But you gotta understand how I feel
The pain and the hardship it took to build
Years of frustration, some got killed
Others fell vic' to the gates of steel
Most try to instill sanity still
stuck on this rock where we don't belong
I wanna go home not sing this song
but I'm forced to perform speech napalm
Calm, surrounded by all types of harm
Dogg man fuck your screwface I watch hands
Watch your hands nigga, I see that, word up..
Word up, peep y'all cats movements
Laid back in the cut like what?
Pay attention.. check it out Dunn
I'm bein watched by snake eyes
Peep them shed skin plenty times
Surrounded by crash dummies and empty minds
Get your shit together Dunn, see between the lines
Stay awoke, to the ways of the wickedest kind
Infamous - cause of the way, I write rhymes
Plus my story's more foul than your newborn eatin swine
(Stupid) Catch a seat, it's about to get deep
like squeezin flouride on your brush for your teeth
or, takin your seed to get shots every week
We need to pay more attention to our surroundings
Busy wildin, all for the wrong cause
Put that same strength into somethin that'll pay off
Don't forget your soul's involved
That same energy you put out, comes right back it revolves
I smash you, Dunn only if I have to
I would hate to, but I'll be more than glad to
The positive and negative war has now begun
P helps you seperate both the sides
Let the truth arise, black devil don't hide
You can't hide from me, you might from the others
I've been employed to pull your ass out from the covers
You walk like you got hooves and talk like you 'sposed to
Trickin my brothers into followin you?  Yo

Teenage killers with Mack-10s
Best friends cut each other's throat and twist they own fan backwards

Ain't I that same nigga we was both on the train goin hard

Takin the phone in the bathroom, whisperin wit your girlfriends

Turned nigga's down, didn't go out all them nights for you

Catch you on the corner while I pass in my truck though

It ain't about that, it's about you givin out my dick
Or so it seems, I can only call it how I see it
Got hoes callin the crib, hangin up not speakin
Come on, what type of shit is that?
What, I'm sposed to sit back, stay up all night for you to get back?
Like the world revolves around P
So while you strolled in at 5 I was comin in at 3 3:30

Fuck it, that's how you wanna rock let's get dirty

Build with skill with technique ? computer A-DAT
My lyrical form is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought flow
Acrobat, sync the track, pump the track
Dance missions, clubs (close?) like spores react by

Strong visions, and hurrying more
Reflects on the dancefloor
Flow it up (blowing up?) and having mad people
showing up (Note)
Packing crowds, jam packed venues
Needles collapse, while atmospheres continues
Sprinkle that, winnin? like that, movin? like that, hittin? like that

Yeah, I'm on the energy source

Different astrology, my intellect's the power (devour?)

Change to another route

I leave cords of mikes hanging like spring leads
You would try so fast (do a track?), beyond the human eye
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E's and pepped up, you get scrapped up (Note)
Smacked up, backed up, your crew's all cracked up
Checking flow, pick choose, quick, you can't stick
My medical brain's a stranger's angles (My medical ? metaphor range is as strange as

You get tangled, twisting side effects us (twist inside affections?)

[I think it's time to discuss your ... ah ...
Philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavor]
Check it, yo!
I always hit the tape with a rough road style
You heard the psychdelic and ya came from miles
Keep my rhymes thick like a Danish brew
So you could call me black and tan when I'm a wreckin' a crew
I'm like Bill Lee whacking when he's in Tangiers
And now I'm out on the sole surviving with my Beatnik peers
Analog reel and a little distortion
Smokin' on somethin' s'you could say I'm scorchin'
I never been the type to rap up a well
Make a man burn his draft card like it was hell
Send ya up the river like you lookin' for Kurtz
I got the mugwump jism up in every verse
(Refrain 2x)
Bug powder dust a mugwump jism
And the wild boys runnin' into some trippin'
Led into control about the Big Brothah
Try like hard to not blow my cover
Who's that man in the windowpane
Got somethin' on his tongue and it's startin' to stain
Sho' nuff equip so wop n'get dancester
Butt bond my ladder and you'll get beat down
Hash bond style so I'm singin' day glow
Wakin' up the dead like serpent and the rainbow
Kick off the shoes and relax your feet
Now roll up your sleeves for this lyrical treat

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo, wordup Dunn
Man you know how I feel
Gotta be more to it than this, word up
*Doing an impression of Scarface*
This what it's all about Dunn? Uh?
Eating, drinking, fucking, sucking (Can't understand)
Whattup, I don't know baby
Nah man, it's not, it's not yo word up
I'm tellin you right now
I know this shit though, aiyyo
Disagreeable, foul energy, tryin to
absorb my energy, knowin it's the strength of me
Take a few to give me a edge
My green light shine bright, Kryptonite type
Fully operational, my physical cream
Put the bottles of smoke down, pick up a magazine
Popped it inside the AR-15
Put it aside, round up the regime
While you rely on religion, I hold a nine
on the mission, to pull fire on your opposition
Revelation was the vision of this
Crack the heavens, it's time to bring the business, shit
My story goes back to them lost Pyramids
I'm seeing things that you won't believe exists
He use a Lunar-tick, suspended in time Dunn
The secondary light got your mind
You rock the fatigues, to squab until ?popular? guns
But are you really prepared, for the things to come?
[KRS-One]
Check it out
True underground sound from the Boogie Down
Uptown Downtown gather round for the showdown, in they faces
Calling out these racists, at Rolling Stone
Spin Details and other places, KRS is The Source
Fuck these magazine leadin hip-hop off course
You'll print about Black Mayors, Black Senators
Why you ain't got no Black Editors?
Everytime I do an interview in Rolling Stone
They sendin me a writer that look like he's Home Alone
Ignorant, to the culture and the microphone
This has got to stop -- your whole spot
is blown sky high, battle why try?
My view is bird's eye, scopin with my third eye
You don't understand, why you're publically banned
until you recognize the writing skills of a black man
Black Editor, all of us ain't thuggin
Gossiping over who's homosexual
Some of us are Black Intellectuals, up in Harlem World
You can't get with me, so now in Midtown
you wanna stop and talk to me?
Bitch ass journalist, is this your fake hip-hop publication?
Look I'm burnin this
[Method Man]
How many didn't want to see it happen
Street moves, live from Staten, if life is a joke, nobody laughin
Hate to see a brother do good through legal action
So you sabotage and throw a Def in the Squad
Fo'-fo's blastin, keep the po-po flashin
these Dark Soul Assassins, Jake's hate the Gods with a passion
So I keep it movin in an orderly, fashion
Pedal to the floor -- peep the Jim Crow law, mind control theory
Y'all niggaz don't hear me, Generation Next
Droppin fast who's next, next to get wet
by the reign of the tech-knowledgy, follow me
Open up wide now, swallow me, every calorie
is reality the truth, the whole truth and
nothin but the truth, taste is the proof
These niggaz want the Juice, and in the crossfire
be the youth, who didn't learn to duck when they shoot
[KAM]
What kind of party is this, it's that political kind
Where America's best, most hypocritical minds
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind
And for the right dollar sign, do white collar crime
behind suits, and clean shaves
I confuse em and use em as tools and slaves
Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations --
I robs the damn nation
so I can live in luxury, you fucks with me
You marryin the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free
I tell the people what they wanna hear
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin
and start back doin dope, cussin and fuckin
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks
That's my style, my pol-i-tricks
Triple-Six convicts, lyin is automatic
in the government, Republican or Democratic
Fuck Freedom, Justice and Equality
Nigga just accept my apology and suck this trick-knowledgy

Yo what up, man!?!
Who the fuck is this?
Who the fuck it sound like, man?
What the fuck you calling so early for, man!?!
What the fuck time is it!?!
It's like 3 o'clock, man, thought you was coming to get me, man!?!
... shit, my bad son.
Please, man, come get me man, before I choke this bitch, man!
Hurry up son, man it's like 90 man, let's get some hoes or something.
What up, dun!?!
Same ol' shit.
No doubt, ain't nothing new... .
Let's take a little spin, dun, word up.
Yo... open my wings to a new day spread my lungs
Get laced, jump in the whip, stash the guns
Twist the key, shifted to D then flee
Before anything, get the daily dose of choke
We got the Benzo flooded with smoke on the float
My eye's burnin' from the dope killin' my throat
Lean my seat a taste, lumbar support
On the belt doin' 90 or more
debatin' on the latest rhyme wars
Where units don't count
But your rap pay add up to large amounts
Get my thrills puttin' other nigga's skills to sleep
Catch chills off'a infamous beats
Swing the trees doin' one-handed u'ees
Blowin' on the ouwee 'cause we can't have the medicine canoein'
There go the boys to the right, no days and nights like that
Ay yo dun, hold that down and turn it around
Dirty as fuck, thugs drugs and guns, d's and fatigues
T n T hopin' out of MPV's
Surprise all'a fuck out of me
Got rubber Glocks pointed at me
Ay yo twin, what the fuck... ..
[Twin]
They had us layed out on the ground holdin' us down
With gats to back of our heads was goin' down
?It wasn't us that held up that bitch you got.
Where's the proof, man!? Let me speak to my attorney.?
I know the routine, don't try to throw me
I been gettin' knocked since 12 and my moms tried to scold me
... but all that told me to get in more shit
ay yo P', (what up) you my co-d, we both get knocked
What you did with that half'a tree? (right in my sock.)
Yo, I hope these fuckin' dicks won't find the stash spot
Dun, you know how I get down!?!
Yo I'm ready to bounce
Do the 100 yard-dash and tear ass
If my other half was alive we woulda got killt
?Cuz dun woulda went for the guns and got ill
Plus I gots cracks on me, they foundt the cracks on me
Looked at'em, gave'em back to me
I could swore they was takin' us in
Then the lady in the car said, ?..that's not them.?
Picked us up, told me I could keep the drugs
They didn't give a fuck, they was only lookin' for guns
An' you ain't gotta tell us twice
We hopped in the car and slid off
On our way up-town for more of that funk
P' lit the tree back up
Got off the Tri-burrough, hit the Henry Huds'
?Fuckit, let's slide through the Rutgers.?
Roll the windows down cuz infamous mobb bumpers...
[Prodigy]
... Skip To My Lou had the crowd jumpin'
Took a walk through the park frontin'
Didn't even have to hurt nuttin'
Man I love it, ain't nothin' like summer in New York
Hear Infamous Thoughts, then the Dream Team music starts
Damn, we young black entrepeneurs
New York Pricks and Dicks can't stop our floss
We like organized crime, the fuckin' Mobb
I'm only twenty-six playin' wit' serious cards
Dead serious cash, luxurious labs
Learn to balance fame with pain, you CAN'T COMPLAIN
[Chinky sings X]
Jus' another day livin' in the hood...
Jus' another day around the way... .
Feelin' good today... oh no we can't complain
Jus' another day... livin' in New York... .
Dealin' with the jakes and the snakes... ..
Feelin' good today... .we hit'em up cuz we here to stay...

We some Queensbridge niggaz that ain't all about rap
We own streets, run websites, log on
to the one and only, InfamousStores.com
We load up the tour buses, to get these checks
We independent, we don't need your respect
We +Infamous Minded+, you've been blinded
It's Bars & Hooks nigga, we.. goin.. diamond!

Years we got crumbs, doin the supplyin

by these ghetto street pharmacist entrepeneurs
Who woulda thought?  The car I always wanted get bought
Sittin on ten times twos, rollin by you
It gets bigger, I remember bein broke
So the plan now is to get richer
Ain't gon' be no scufflin my nigga, I ain't gon' fight ya
I'ma pay the piper to snipe ya, it's real like that
Goin diamond make you feel like that
Cause I done been through the bullshit, dealt with the bullshit

Waiting for a girl who's got curlers in her hair
Waiting for a girl she has no money anywhere
We get buses everywhere
Waiting for a factory girl
Waiting for a girl and her knees are much too fat
Waiting for a girl who wears scarves instead of hats
Her zipper's broken down the back
Waiting for a factory girl
Waiting for a girl and she gets me into fights
Waiting for a girl we get drunk on friday night
She's a sight for sore eyes
Waiting for a factory girl
Waiting for a girl and she's got stains all down her dress
Waiting for a girl and my feet are getting wet
She ain't come out yet
Waiting for a factory girl

It's real.. check it out tho'
Respect the I-M-D
Fresh out the car in the R-A-double-P, E-R
P-E-double, when I speak it gets real
Flakes try to tell me, ""Yo Dunn, nah chill
You can't come out, wylin out like that
Rhymes so vivid Dunn I see what you sayin""
But you gotta understand how I feel
The pain and the hardship it took to build
Years of frustration, some got killed
Others fell vic' to the gates of steel
Most try to instill sanity still
stuck on this rock where we don't belong
I wanna go home not sing this song
but I'm forced to perform speech napalm
Calm, surrounded by all types of harm
Dogg man fuck your screwface I watch hands
Watch your hands nigga, I see that, word up..
Word up, peep y'all cats movements
Laid back in the cut like what?
Pay attention.. check it out Dunn
I'm bein watched by snake eyes
Peep them shed skin plenty times
Surrounded by crash dummies and empty minds
Get your shit together Dunn, see between the lines
Stay awoke, to the ways of the wickedest kind
Infamous - cause of the way, I write rhymes
Plus my story's more foul than your newborn eatin swine
(Stupid) Catch a seat, it's about to get deep
like squeezin flouride on your brush for your teeth
or, takin your seed to get shots every week
We need to pay more attention to our surroundings
Busy wildin, all for the wrong cause
Put that same strength into somethin that'll pay off
Don't forget your soul's involved
That same energy you put out, comes right back it revolves
I smash you, Dunn only if I have to
I would hate to, but I'll be more than glad to
The positive and negative war has now begun
P helps you seperate both the sides
Let the truth arise, black devil don't hide
You can't hide from me, you might from the others
I've been employed to pull your ass out from the covers
You walk like you got hooves and talk like you 'sposed to
Trickin my brothers into followin you?  Yo
Potential energy is easily made kinetic
I turn 'em all back where they belong, don't wet it
What? Set it..
Set it nigga, fuckin fake-ass motherfuckers
Take your mask off nigga what?  (what.. what..)

Whatever group or vest in line I put 'em all behind
Play MC Ultra as a warning sign of my skill, and what my mind deserves
I smell a grape in the duck preserves and
Who deserves the right to be king of the screen
And shout wack poetry what, are you buggin'
Germs that want to law me, quit it, before I heat your ear off

Sends niggaz on Amtrak with those for your body
It pays for thirty plane tickets if we got beef, huh
Hardly, you all know what that is
I grew up in the hoods and the projects wit dope fiends and crack heads
Teenage killers with Mack-10s
Best friends cut each other's throat and twist they own fan backwards
Maybe that'd live now I'm on some rap shit
Album sold out keeps me far from the big house
The hand guns from that bigger house
Cuz ain't nobody cuttin for me to enforce to hold it down like

Thats why
I keep things in proper prospective
And every album point y'all niggas in the right direction
There's  no protection, when I'm on the mike
You couldn't fold me
If you trained all your life
You's a chump, I'm a champ
You broke, I'm top dollar
Niggaz gotta whole lotta mouth
Thats no problem
Fake thugs lay down
Real killers dont yell it
Bring it don't sing it nigga
Use intelligence
Its evident you not, murder material
When you all alone, you pose guns in the mirror yo
Chinky, Rapper Noyd, Hav, G part 3, my nigga Bino and Nitty
Y'all feel me
Let me get deeper in the subject
Cause its gets me hard
Every nigga holding
Dont mean he gonn arc
Any nigga that show it
Need to disown it
Or get it tooken by another who deserve it
Listen, this is what it takes to survive today
Use your eyes, to my niggaz thats ride with me
And you see that nigga P, be the storm quiet
Im holding, so ease back
I stay infamous minded

They can look you in the eye and tell you shit..
They say because the teacher's racist..
Then go off blaming the fucking
Fuck all of these faggot's who think I care..
Too  greedy, that they can't even share..
What the fuck's your significance in life?
You have none..
You're just a dumbass fucking dyke..
And I fight in my rhymes for the

You don't even treat black's equal..
Sending troop's into Iraq, just so they can die..
In the end..
I aint see tear's, I just see all of these lie's..
When the truth's out..
You faggot's start to cry..
If I ever meet one of you fag's in my lifetime..
I'll kill you and put you in the hospital..
You thought I gave a fuck if you died?
Sike..
I'll pull up with the izuzu to ya fuckin room..
And take out your life support and life line..
No law's agaisnt cannible's eating childern like cantilopes..
Then mailing their body part's in the mail through envelopes..
How the fuck is america going to develop?
Bush sit's in his coke..
Looking like a faggot making up fake word's with your nasty
Probably end up like Bill Clinton, and deny the affair..
You just wait, because your  is coming..
November bitch, it's to start running..
You seeing them feed the childern commercials?
You don't even give a fuck..
You have your own daughter sucking your dick until it's purple.

Popped it inside the AR-15
Put it aside, round up the regime
While you rely on religion, I hold a nine

Thirty-thousand dollar chains that swing
Yo catch me in the street, poppin that bullshit
Catch a fat lip, hoes all over your shit
Bust guns like, nuts all over your bitch
Yo youse a woman, tell me what the fuck you tryin to do when
you're growlin all over the top, you get chewed when
I touch that shit, not only that on the concrete
We splash more niggaz than the wavepool did
Check out my new shit, we blood spill, you still ice grill
Mad cause your clique's shit is homo, the Mobb stay real
You steady playin the field
Nigga you sideline rhyme
Customers complain they can't feel
You cooked up a half-ass meal
It's time for me to catch burn on the wheels of steel
My shit fills, the appetite of the populace
We could do it via satellites and such
And show the world how that ass get bust
Ever since a little youth, I had this lust
to pick up the motherfuckin pen and just rush
like morphine beats, through the wires of the EPS plus
you get penalized, for tryin to rock with the utmost
Get branded, for bein weak the most, now be ghost
The fuck outta here, with that bullshit you tryin to share
with the planet, you need to be shot rappin
I got sickle cell I feel the pain all year, what's happenin
Fake thug wanna front like they contractin
Numbers on my head, Dunn please, I'm here waitin
You can't touch me, there's no fake love amongst me
There's no fake niggaz that's run with me
Somebody gave y'all the wrong info, I ain't the Kiko
You nympho, put me on to where you breathe at
You 'sposed to taught that bitch much better than that
I dwell, where the rest of my vets is at
From, some to 'Ville to BX and back
to the lab and the dungeon
My house of reresentatives stay starvin, beats thumpin
We unholy, cause there ain't a part missin

Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn; I'll never lead you astray
Take my word niggaz wanna hear how you think
It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win
that stay playin in they decks over and again
Speak your thoughts, put your all in it

Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape
A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst
Makes fake niggaz disperse, they never challenge what works

Balancin the weakness, is what I specialize in
Dunn you my nigga cause you keep me hype when I'm writin
Kept me on point in the night when it might go down
Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well
Kept me focused on what's real and nuttin else
I find it healthy, to conversate with myself
I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years)
It's that inner voice you shoulda took head to and shit
Coulda been home instead of bleedin
Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks

Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell
Remember last week's mission?  I told you bring the gun
(Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory
I'm the one you could come to for guidance
Bring you home alive when you wildin
Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray
Told you when it's time to put it away
and when the cops came, you was safe

Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin
Everytime we speak it's real, I know your intention's
to make sure we both safe and livin, and breathin
You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it

Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay
Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us
(What about the click?) Now if you die is they comin?
When you shot do they feel the bullet?
And when you broke can they fix it?  Aight then, you keep writin
and let me do the thinkin, I brought us this far without mistaken

Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin
Cautions I shoulda took head, lost in my weed, steady losin
Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed
Whores on they knees, fuckin with millionaires, killers and thieves
I fuck until there's no feelin where, I bust and I pee
I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep
I stay to myself, one deep, pray to my God cause he
say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness
Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferrari's
with two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right
See niggaz smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back
Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back
Why's it like that?  It's life black, this is the game
The way I see it both bitches and niggaz, is the same
I trust myself, I can't fuck myself
When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself
Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches
Beware of leaches, the vampires, my secret's
never follow, cause most niggaz is straight up cowards
Take care of my body's the temple my mind is the power

On the strength that I had to hurt something
Cuz my stomach hurtin
I'm a cool nigga, but don't let me start buggin

Respect the I.M.D. embroidery

We need D batteries for the theme music
Snatch the biscuits from out the lawn
Fuck a cab, lets take cracked-out Yolanda's Saab
We gave that bitch two wibbles
And skated off with her vehicle for that pillow
All outside the borough, dunn what happened to Queens
Like Supton(?) and 1-2-1, Farmers and 116th
The got us on the B-Q-E, just to get a taste of that greenery
We took our smoke out to Coney Island, posted up by the Himalaya
Pina Colada champales mixed with Dani'
That's St. Ide's in dunn lingo
Spillin it on the floor for our dead people
While I spark the sequel shit; my niggaz got lungs
When we smoke, that shit only go around once

A crackhead fuck spent his last bucks on six dimes
I'm one gram from big time, a spliff away from overdosin
My heart is broken, my man started smokin again
P, I heard the tunnel open again
I spoke to Flex he said he's gonna let both of us in
Its time to load up the autos and semis
I wish my niggas bank was in a physical form unlike
I got my uptown nikes thugged out and icy
Mad deep, jumpin out the Cocaine white Jeep
Through was strugglin, so I resume hustlin
Rap game or crack game my crew is still bubblin
Yo, three in the morning and the D's on the corna still
Seems we were born to kill, yo P meet me on the hill
So we can jet through Queens in SUV's
Show these motherfuckers how we rep this thang, ya know?

They can sentence me to life  but I won't go to jail

Look straight in my eyes, tell me what you see?
Is it that same nigga that you fell for from the door
Ain't I that same nigga we was both on the train goin hard
and then your shit surfaced
Takin the phone in the bathroom, whisperin wit your girlfriends
Try to play me on some jerk shit
Numbers underneath the sole of your lady Timb's
... oohh shit!!
[B.K.]
Kid, I kept it tight for you
Turned nigga's down, didn't go out all them nights for you
And I ain't even that type'a bitch
I heard about Jones Beach and Luke's Freak Fest
Nevertheless I still put my faith in you
You was my dog, so I stayed faithful
But I'll be god damned if I be some nigga dumb bitch
It's fucked up it gotta go down like this...
(Chorus:)
[P] Yo, have you ever had a bitch that'll pop guns for you?
[B] Type of nigga you'll do anything he ask to?
[P] Snake bitch turn around and backstab you?
[B] Crab nigga found out he fucked around too?
[P] Threw her cash, threw in the smash, that's boo

You was once my bunny, now you want to act funny
I'm that same nigga from the first day who dress bummy
Same grimy style nigga, I'm still hungry
I never lost my thirst for takin that money
I never lost my lust for chicks lovely
You met me on those terms, so that's how I'm runnin
I still walk up in the crib 5 in the mornin
... and still count my cash before I crash
What you thought, you had a dunny?  I ain't the one honey
You skim 20's out of my stacks of Benny's
You done found yourself a street life love, to death do us
Remember that shit, now everything's ass-backwards
We was more like Mickie and Mallory
You fouled out on me; found another man math in your belly bag, damn!
I wish you luck though, you sneaky bum hoe
Catch you on the corner while I pass in my truck though
[B.K.]
Yeah aight
First of all Fuck You, and everything you own nigga
You got a lotta nerve, nigga
I should throw a brick thrrough your shit, fuck your whips
It ain't about that, it's about you givin out my dick
Or so it seems, I can only call it how I see it
Got hoes callin the crib, hangin up not speakin
Come on, what type of shit is that?
What, I'm sposed to sit back, stay up all night for you to get back?
Like the world revolves around P
So while you strolled in at 5 I was comin in at 3 3:30
Niggas wanna play dirty
Fuck it, that's how you wanna rock let's get dirty
Yeah, condom wrappers in the back of the Azure
Talkin bout you let your mans get off, your G ain't strong
I'm gone, you ain't worth the tears
You lost the best thing you ever had in your life, a waste of my years

Memories play back like film
I flash back we was little niggas livin most real
1989's when we first met
We first clicked over convo' gettin twisted
In dunn grand earth crib cuttin outta school
Watchin cable it seemed like the other day
Through the eyes of a stranger we was kids
But in our own minds we was grown mens
Outside on the block we would play the bench
And y'all play the rock every chance y'all got
As I sat back and just watched hey, what can I say?
The same back then as I am today
I can recall me, Jemel and Jamal
In the room drinkin straight vodka with they moms
When I walk home with the big nefertiti charm
Back with the light blue camoflauge suit
God me and Hav' doin it hard, tryin to get on
We sampled songs on the box with record and pause
Killer B didnt even get his first firearm
And I was still holdin one shot derringers
[Hook: Prodigy]
Who would think anyone of us would cease to exist
Left with just thoughts of the past to reminisce
Sometimes I see a chick walkin past with ya kids
Or find an old flicka of some 1-2-5th
All the shit that we been through it boils to this?
Dun, I wish we could start it all over again
[Prodigy]
Ninety-five, we on top tourin the states
A lotta times we even took the click overseas
Came along way from the hallway
Sitting in the staircase with Bacardi
Bring the honeycomb speaker outside to bang
While we would share drinks with the other that came
Triple L stayed takin they cash in dice games
Killer Black grew to keep an ice grill, dunn was not playin
Yammy, the most Infamous told me one day
""Put the bogies down 'fore I pound you out P""
But it was all love, we was eash others dunns
We held each other down, borrowed each other guns
Its hard to believe that niggas so strong
could die so easily forever be gone
I could still feel the web of your palm, against mine
cause we did our hand shake all the time
Why it have to be your time to go and not mines?
Spilled tears contemplating to my delf cryin
All the laughs we shared and fights we had
All the nights we would get nice, damn
Plates of food we split in half
I dedicate the rest of my life to all my niggas that passed
[Hook]

Nobody can't take nuttin else from me man that's it

I'm from Iraq, home of the snakes
Niggaz ain't got love for the jakes; do whatever it takes
Climbin down terraces, and the fire escapes
Yo we move money, money move me
Yo I'm usually, livin it up (livin it up nigga what?)
Gettin my dick sucked
Bone a bitch in the butt, make her say what-what
[Prodigy]
Now gun talk, do you speak the same language?
For your sake, I hope so, let's rap a taste yo
My shit spit like a retard, and plus boss
I drool for the day me and you could face-off
It gets gangster, when my clique step in the room
We blow torches, and celebrate good fortune
This is for my dunns who rest in coffins
I wish y'all was, wish y'all was here
[Chorus]
[Noreaga]
Yo what the deally P?  Iraq, can buy out Q.B.
And you know we smash the industry, negatively
So fuck a good boy, I always been a foul hood boy
Yo as a youth I had ring-worms, and all that shit
A lil' dirt ball nigga, throwin dirt at ya clique
Cause me an Aknel nigga ain't packed no bags
We rather, be in the streets, sellin yellow mesc' tabs
Cause where we from, muh'fucker yo the game don't stops
Or we was, out thuggin yo we had chicken-pox
Me Mus', Maze, Outlaw, +Final Chapter+ brigades
It definitely get real, on stage
I ain't the Madd Rapper, but I'm mad at rap niggaz
They're sellin records yo, actin like they clap niggaz
Cause me and P. get money like L.S.G.
While them cats small change like a E.S.3.
Yo I'm still the same cat, that I used to be
Often, I'm on tour with my rosaries
Coastin, always hit 'em with the thug potion
Look at you now, now you just full emotion
Prankster height, my peoples like the gangster-type
Queens niggaz like to shoot, ain't afraid to fight
While y'all niggaz wear Pampers like the cradle type
Mainly hype, thugged-out, shined with light
[Chorus]

.. much more than you asked
So many years and tears, the blood and sweat that fell
Now it speak for itself
I be the same nigga.. (get rich nigga)
Uh-huh, get yours nigga, get yours nigga..
We take yours nigga..
Yo, yo I can see it Dunn, yo let's be it Dunn
and we can manifest all the cash we ever dreamed of
It's the cream I love, for the team I shove
all fakeness and everything else to far away from us
Ain't no discussin for the plush life
My niggaz go hard and knock y'all down to survive
In this jungle, wilderness, we was raised
by the wolves and the scavengers, instincts like a animal
But it toughened us, put a whole lot of thug in us
And it paid off, cause can't none of y'all fuck with us
Don't get it twist, I know, anyone can get touched
but uhh - my style of Dunn is too quick to bust
and too swift to just, talk in angles to
Let me straighten that shit out for you, peep it
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, the best kept secret
We killers, but chill Dunn (shhh) that's best kept secret
Let's not jump off the topic, we talkin bout cash
Fuckin with mines'll be, much more than your ass
So many years and tears and blood and sweat that fell
This dirt underneath my fingernails speak for itself
I be the same if I had billions
You couldn't understand my pain if you lived it
Give me the riches, and all of my Dunns'll be drivin
It's beautiful to see the click, live comfortable
{*Chorus: Prodigy and B.G.*}
[P]	To the Young Black Entrepeneurs
[B.G.]	Get rich, get money, get paper, get paid
Keep yourself laced, and get your ones
Get your Dunns out the slums
[P]	To the Young Black Entrepeneurs
[B.G.]	Get dollars, get cash, straight up don't get fucked
Get your bucks, and get big
Stash your first millions and live off the interest
[P]	To the Young Black Entrepeneurs
[P]	To the Young Black Entrepeneurs
[B.G.]
When I hit the block, pistol on my side, bundle of dope in my socks
Dime bags of powder, sack of twenty dollar rocks
I'ma hustler, I was taught be bout green
Therefore, I got to have it by all means
I be thuggin, B.G. was raised that way
Can't see me bein a hoe, you'll get played that way
If I'm broke, you got coke, unhands that yay
Be a man, don't break it off, gotta blast that K
Drama, I love that, I bring that shit
Dick get hard off that shoot-em-up and bang bang shit
I'm Mobb Deep, with this click that I'm with, believe that
Disrespect us if you want, we bang for feedback
Glock got a bad mouth, when it start it don't stop
Black talons go straight through the heart and close shop
I'ma guerilla, I run with jackers and gangsters
Convicted felons, and believe we armed and dangerous
It gets real, I'm prepared for whatever it come to
Let me catch ya with your drawers down, I'ma down you
Police will find you in a project dumpster
withcha dick cut off, stuffed in your mouth motherfucker
I don't care, about you or no nigga that you fuck with
Alla y'all can slip and get your head busted
B.Geezy love this, gangsta shit nigga
Whoever I beef with I creep and spank ya quick nigga

Naw, you can never feel my pain nigga
And you can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel my pain nigga
How do I start it
[Verse 1]
Nineteen seventy four, motherfucker I was born with pain
My moms and my pops pass it down to me
So don't talk to me about can I feel yours
Cause I ain't feelin you at all, your pain isn't pure
You cryin cause you broke from the projects
That's not pain, that's emotions, you a bitch
Im talkin bout permanent, physical sufferin
You know nothin about that
You just complain cause you stressed
Nigga, my pain's in the flesh
And through the years that pain became my friend; sedated
with morphine as a little kid
I built a tolerance for drugs, addicted to the medicine
Now hospital emergency treat me like a fiend
I rather die sometimes I wish a nigga O.D.
Beggin God for help, only to find
that I'm all by my God damn self
Ay you can never feel my pain nigga
Naw, can never feel my pain nigga
Can never feel my pain nigga
Never feel the pain nigga
You could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, never feel the pain nigga
[Verse 2]
And the females ask - P, why you always look mad?
Don't mind me if I may come off like that
But see, a nigga depressed, I need smoke
I need me a drink, I'm tryin to stop those
Experience life, through the shoes of me
What you find, is you can't do that, you ain't built for it
The impact I put on this earth
It's like nuttin that you ever seen or heard; so look listen
When I speak, sit up in your seat
Pay attention to the words, cause the story is deep
In and out of crisis, since before I could walk
It gave me strength though, nowadays I hardly talk
It made me cold-hearted, anti, I won't play sports
I barely joke or play games, take it how you want
My handicap took its toll on my sanity
My moms got me at the shrink at like 13
And doctors called the cops on me
Cause I be throwin IV poles and they ignore me
I gotta, try to calm down and breathe
I can only hold it but for so long; put me to sleep
Do I sound insane... if I do, then this here was written for you
Cause you could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, can never feel my pain nigga
Could never feel my pain nigga
Never feel the pain nigga
You could never feel the pain nigga
Naw, never feel the pain nigga

Across the world the message flies
Information, truth and lies
It's all yours and it`s all mine
You just have to find the time
We're all the same, we share the blame, we play the games
If it's yes or no the decision is easy, it's easy
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
This time the revolution will be computerised
You'll know it as you do it
In real time before your eyes
Slip between realities
There's more to this than anything that you or I can see
The world is mine, the world is yours and here's the cause
Zeroes and ones will take us there.
I've stared into the heart of it all
Seen the pictures on the wall
The beat of a heart
The oceans part and the patterns in my mind
This time, we've split the world once more
There's those that have and that don`t in information wars
Wer'e not alone ?cos all is known, and it`s everywhere
Zeroes and ones will take us there

Yeah, Guess who it is
Ayo Dre I think they in trouble
Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to 'em
Feels like a new day, listen
[ Verse 1 ] [ Busta ]
Now every time I come in I hit ya niggas with shit regardless
Uou get retarted,then you niggas aint got a clue.
On how the fuck I do what I do, and say what I say,
And spit what I spit, you aint never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that could ever convince
my villi turn the place into a mutha fuckin' zoo
Than I come in I spit cr crazy sh sh sh shit and
ma ma ma makin ni ni ni niggas do exactly what I want'em to
From my point of view instead of tryin to step up
you still tryin to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and fret and get schizophrenic
and let they emotions out and I doubt they could ever test my crew
Take a second check it I reckon my records are
better than whatever record you recorded that why your shit is through.
You fuckin idiot I dont think you get it im one of
the greatest ever period every syllable is true
[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
Now if you aint runnin you aint handicappin your vision
I think its simple and I think that its really plain to see
No matter how much you try no matter how much you make an effort
you niggas could never ever really fuck wit me.
Cause ill hurt you .. and I will learn you a thing or two
And ill hurt you.....and ill finish your career for you.....I'll
[ Verse 2 ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of
Bumblin fools who got me rumblin dudes all the way down the block.
Keep'em stumblin and jumblin over they words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin outta time sick and tired of all your
Ma ma mumblin ma ma mublin na na nigga I got it locked.
Every single time you put my shit in the cd playa and
Turn up the volume you bang your head with courtesy of knock I
Continue to crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga wit the glock
Than I watch you while I keep a fumblin while I got you
Ta tremblin for one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock
Before I start to do another thing that'll make you crown me
the king wit such a butterswing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds the summer bling
while im climbin and from a glimpse tell you bitch to get off my yot
[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
[ Verse 3 ] [ Eminem ]
Shit on the mic and doodle my doo doo
You do not have a fighting chance to move you are covered in my poo poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid
Dou dou dou dou dou dou ga ga ga goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have it watch
So you just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Excuse my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
You're probably wonderin why there's thunder and everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause busa bus and flipmode just tiptoed into the club
Then with shady quietly try not to start a riot with Doc
But since we already started we might as well have a party
So gather out everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you aint got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in your closet, throw somethin on and get to the club

Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp
C-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant
Yah yah, yah (AHH!)
My shit be so ginamic

Bring one mc, two mc, three mc.
Send any mc's. it doesn't matter to me.
Sterp up like a thief in the night.
No wins and I begin. my third eye is bright.
Here to shine. light skies the limit on d.l.
Who fell, yeah time will tell.
The leaders of the new.
The #1 crew blunts and brew for the hip-hop school.
Girls got my picture posters, pin-ups.
Wanna skin up (big up, big up).
It's a race against the clock, and I can't stop countdown,
Hear the sound see boogie brown..
(uptown saturday night) 125 we arrive so live from new york,
Word life. you know I can kick it.
At my show on the down low, you're sellin? wolf-tickets.
Ha ha, the trigger I'm tryin? to tell ya.
Now my nigga, I'm getting larger and bigger the factor
Here to cockalak! a crack that back like a chiropractor
Just the collective my perspective to be
Effective is the main objective.

Any violations won't be tolerated.
Let's not debate it if you hate it, 'cause I made it.
The loot, the boob tube, all that shit included,
In a matter of seconds you will be excluded.
Checka check it out.
East coast stomp in action for rich or for poor.
We created the fashion left (foot),
Right (foot), stomp (stomp).
Leaders of the new school do the east coast stomp.

Bring ?em in, bring em in
See the clock on the wall with one eye open.
Scarface to brawl to panic seized quarter cut.
Squeezed to ten gave quarter back five with a minute to win,

To backspin speakin? spic spans off spills of crack bins
So get your action. right locating jaws draw.
Bite mars is mourned warned rating.

[Busta Rhymes]
yo, it all began like, bust it
My nigga City bout to bounce on a trip
We met some niggas with alot of things they want em to flip
I told my nigga get the dough and keep the blau on your hip
Travel safe, you know that I'ma hold it down on the strip
Good lookin, word to mother son I give you my wit
But when I get back, I'ma bounce straight to your crib
On the strength, son slid until you to the Greyhound
Wit a burner in the knapsack, headed straight outta town
Now, three days pass I'm still on the strip
Doin hand to hand with twelve collapsible, stashable clips
With little magnets on the side of the clips we planted like a project
When police come we stick the clips in any metal object
Throwin a nigga on the walls and try to search me down
I laugh knowin that my stash'll never be found
Well anyway, on the third day, son came straight to the strip
Wit a new floss and shiny shoes on the whip
My nigga hit me with the latest, greatest
He told me get inside the whip so I can know just what the up to date is
He said he fuckin wit some Guyanese niggas how ill them niggas is
What kind of dough they get, and how they handle they biz
How they connect with Jamaician niggas who speak American
And how they chains swung a medallion iced out pelicans
And how they stay wit four pounders
And speak American to try to blend in
Like they aint obvious out of towners
Okay, I've never heard of workers gettin five G's pay
For trips that last for only 2-3 day
How these Guyanese niggas be eatin pasta but they love zucchini
Rockin valor tennis suits by Sergio Tecchini
Them type of cats that call you because you can't call 'em
Rockin baseball fitters with wild animal skins on 'em
How they rock silks and tailor made pants
And get a matching bally shoe for the silk to step in the dance
Washrags hangin from every one of our back pockets
>From every fine wine to champagne them niggas'll straight cop it
And set up shops in them neighborhoods that was residential
Rock laced whips while the workers'll floss the latest rentals
How they fuck with arrogant bitches who act pussy
And love to hustle wit niggas and stash coke up in they pussy
After all of that I wanted ones
The way my nigga was talkin so next trip I went to bounce with son
So now we out of town with Guyanese cats
Up in they gates bubbling packages and layin wit gats
Shit was slow until the main fiend was offed
Just like a thief in the night
And spread the word that we was back with the white
[Intermission]
""Ayo why don't you tell that crackhead to close the fuckin door
and shut the fuck up""
""Yeah man and clean the motherfucking spot up, smell like...""
""Break the fuckin breakdown in the working city... yo go get the plates
and the gym star""
""Yo light that up, lemme hit that, gimme a light, yeah man cut that""
""Fuck this shit""
[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah, see how we blowin pa
The lookout niggas holdin fort like they was watchtowers
Buggin on how we went through, a half a brick every couple of hours
So on and so on, shit is good and we eatin
First nigga to short a package will catch the most brutal beatin
The whole town, see we now own it
Carryin on and blemishing all in the hearts of the best moments
We stackin cheddar now and shit is all clear
And we was growin as workin niggas wit aspiring ideas
We love to floss and the feeling of pushing chrome shit
But in the grand scheme these niggas'll love to have they own shit
Now these niggas was really ready to swell up
We decided to separate from them niggas and make our shit develop
Off in to the wilderness of the wicked Husid
We set up shops and watched the games begin
So now we ballin like a motherfucker, money was sick
Gas on the cheddar and these bitches ridin the dick
Fuckin everything from the local McDonald's bitches with the biggest ass
To attorney bitches that'll beat a charge fast
We used to takin niggas' custies and leave they set up on tilt
And watch 'em angrily scheme on the shit that we built
Aint it funny how shit transpire in fact
Not too long after our ride we took the winner's stash, house was at
Some niggas tried to run a jook with things in they palm
Not a problem so immediately reach for the john
Right away the gun BUST! straight lifted a nigga
How we moved his organs with kickback, shifted a nigga
Wild shots fire, everybody scatter like rats
Leavin nothing but gunpowder and a trail of smoke in these gats
Now we got this faggot nigga blood on our hands
But fuck it, determined to fulfill the best of these plans
Shit was hot but we was nowhere near ready to fall
My son said he shot, but he wasn't bleeding at all
Word, I started buggin when my nigga said he feel cold
Then I looked up on the right side of his shirt and found a little hole
So as we continue to radically blaze the fifth
Flame the iron, not giving a fuck, y'all niggas wanna rip?
Well we deaded three out of the four niggas who tried to jook
One nigga slid and think he got off the hook
Now let me find out one out of them three niggas we bodied
Was one of them Guyanese niggas who buy drinks up for the party
He was the nigga to flood the table with champagnes
Stupid motherfucker tried to front, we had to leak his brain
Suddenly my nigga fell to the floor
And said his legs feel like them shits aint got no feelins no more
More the actin up the more the shit I felt in my gut
The shit was all over as soon as the director said CUT!
That's a wrap, good actin motherfuckers, good actin
That's the shit I'm talkin about
Y'all ready to watch the playback?
Fuck around, that shit'll be a box office smash motherfuckers
[applause]

I 8Off like the Assassin, now I'm blastin I'm takin over
Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, sinc the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O.

She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo
Hahahaaa!  I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
so my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless
Many niggaz wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm gettin phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST NIGGAZ SHIT
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and...
People always askin me, how your shit be sellin
For makin shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no tellin, when I was strikin had you swellin
Cruisin in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin
Yo FUCK THAT!  You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin
If you ain't makin noise you need to kill the fuckin yellin
Chorus One
Chorus Two
Verse Two: Rampage, Busta
Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city...
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
Your lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin five in The Source
I be saddleback biting motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggaz all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss
Aiyyo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.
Now I'm writin rhymes hittin shorties everyday
In the full runnin drinkin ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fellet
Now I'm knockin out niggaz from .. to .. touche!
Now I'm goin back around the way
I'm rippin shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye
Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggaz open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton
It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Fixx
Stickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggaz open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'
Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Everytime I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggaz look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music, fans understand
Making fat shit, I always love to lend a helping hand
Organized rhyme unit like the Poison Clan
While your ride is busted, I be your luxury Sedan
Number one nigga in the chain of command
Breakin fool in school like my nigga Geechie Dan
Aiyyyyyo, I see intruders on my scan
Singin at your funeral like Bobby Bluebland

Make you remember the torture like the frostbite that bit off your finger
This Means War, I said it before
Adrenaline rush, heart beat rapid, sweat wet up the floor
Try to threat and wanna battle me nigga
I'ma show you the major differnce between a dream and reality nigga
Yo, then I continuously hype up a nation
Huddle wit my niggas plan for tomorrow go into isolation
And analyze how many niggas gon lose
Tryin to squeeze they foot up in a pair of great man shoes
And analyze how we was needed to live
Carry out my dooney give the most thanks and be appreciative
Pass this to all my seeds after me
Represent and fight to be that everything my seeds want me to be
The economy has been at it's best, to all my niggas hungry
Let's keep weavin and magical methods of makin money
So I'ma rep at my fullest, you can't spark me
And fight the hardest in the grim current state of Anarchy...

Remember I was tryin' to get my drink in the slot
And you was same girl actin' all stinkin' the spot

A friend couldn't find her cause shorty left with the God

Yo me and my niggas and my clique be getting mad cream
Balling the club, now I'm drunk having a bad dream
This mothafucker tried to greet me with wealth
I never knew that I would see that day that I would meet the devil himself
This nigga was eagerly waiting to prove it
Astonishingly, already dancing to his own burial music
Well anyway, he plottin' to do it to me
In a certain kind of way, and started off directly popping shit to me
While he spoke a couple of fires would spark
While he sat in the shadow talking his shit we watch the sky getting dark (he said)
[Devil]
(?) Where it hurts
I'll leave you in a (?) straight up leaking in the back of a church
Let a ghosting crib and haunt you like a ghost in your home
Leaving you old and crippet like them ruins in Rome
Watch your body shrivel up and turn your asses to smoke
Fuck your flesh don't get yo blood sucked, the blood of ya foes
I be that nigga that'll torture your spouse
And leave a thousand body bags like truth.com in front of your house
[Busta]
Got me bugging on a whole notha level
Tell me how the fuck a nigga really end up having beef with the devil
Shit bomb the whole effect the nigga had on my dreaming
Body reacting mentally, going to war with the demon
Semi-chaotic like the typical storm
So embellished in the dream a nigga felt it in the physical form
The dream got my nose runny and shit
Eyes watery, shorty watching my body twitch funny and shit
Giving shorty sleeping with me the creeps
She bugging off how a nigga just sweating and breathing so hard in his sleep
Determined to conquer this nigga so let it begin
Absolutely focused on killing the demon within
So now we fight in the name of my brethren
And every blow connect during the fight you can hear the thunder roll into heaven,
Ain't hell a deep breath of fresh air
The devil's presence blows a cold draft leaving a scent of death in the air
While my mind was reassembling now
Simultaneous wifey watching a nigga body trembling now
Couldn't conquer me so now the devil wanted me dead
Stabbing a nigga with the same bone he ripped from his head
Yo its funny how the devils'll test us
But if fully select, niggas bless with something some'll raggle with impressions
Til I'm dead I'm always battling through
You can't believe you cut my main vein that all my blood be traveling through
Somebody gotta die, settle the score
Because it's me or this nigga, I'm fighting to the death, I'm ready for WAR

Been through the storm, through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
You see the luxuries in life, with the fortune and fame
Like them Cadillacs with sunroofs mayne
So many ways to make a dollar
Huh, sometimes I think about my father
You see my poppa was broke, and my momma was young
Tryin to blend in with them city folk
Every day landlord knockin down my do'
Wonderin where my next blessing is comin from
My momma and poppa, moved to the U.S. as Jamaicans
Struggled to get visas and green cards through immigration
Though my pop was po', stayed away from crime and malice
Hard living gave him hard hands and callous
As a young'n, peep how much they loved each other's space
His hard hands rubbin against the pretty skin of my mother's face
Dig for treasure 'til his hands looked like hands of a junkie
So coarse, slap a mule and take the life from a donkey
On the other hand, mommy was the type to work two jobs
Never enough money, that's why I got your whole crew robbed
Got older, developed ways of grippin the steel
Barely home for me to see her, or get a good cooked meal
Seek refuge in the alleged land of the free, lookin
Blendin in with city folk, down in Flatbush Brooklyn
Feel a little of my pain, follow and sing to it
Homey I seen it all, if you ain't knowin I been through it
In other words I

Got a little older, late teens, me and my crew would huddle
On the corner late nights, plottin to escape struggle
Nights got cold and still would hustle in the same place
In front of Pancho Delis, now the freeze up on a nigga face
1987 Reaganomics ever curious
to visit other cities, out of town kick was serious
Guayanese jeans bounce, put whatever slinger on
Whatever slinger came back, quickly brought me right along
Nigga ran away from home
Doin different wild shit, just to put a pair of Filas on, 'Didas on
Wreck is all for the good, gettin into shit
Like we innocent, actin older than should
Walk around broke in the hood, watchin all the rich niggaz
These younger thugs who try to choke and try to get niggaz
Thinkin 'bout my mom and pop, while I'm monopolizin
To hell with just gettin by and economizin
It's kinda hard bein humble in the belly of struggle
Doin things that probably get you in trouble
That's why we stay up on the block, gettin money while we keepin it safe
In front of churchgoers keepin the faith
Mom and pop be worryin for they son
Despite they struggle and their honest livin look and see just what I become
A scavenger, in brute pursuit to be happy, another young'n that's wildin
Across the line until somebody tryin to cap me - ohhhh shit
I been through the storm
Through the cold and rain
Everything's still the same
Can't control how I feel
Sometimes it's hard to keep it real
Woooooooooooooo-whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh

Ready for wylin? my niggas
Let's set it like we on an island my niggas
I'm with it (what what what what)
Yo
My clique startle bitches
With a remarkable sparkle
For my bitches with me (what what what what)
You know we stay dumb
And keep shop running
Just the like the 24-hour deli
The way y'all niggas be popping that shit you be talking
Y'all niggas don't mean nothing
But a 24-hour celly
To talk that funny shit
To someone you know
While I bag these bitches
And take them to 24-hour telly
Type of chickens to let me get in they belly
Little sexy thug bitches
Who want me to fuck them to makeveli
Then get with my niggas and smoke up a ounce
Crowd up in whatever amounts
Making bitches skip to my bounce
So whenever we be shining like diamond
Fresher than the fragrance of limon
When we strike
It's all in the timing
Corporate niggas ball on how we be stylin?
Fucking with huge contracts
With white beaters on
On the day of the signing
Making all my bitches check for this shit
My live niggas know the truth
That's why they always got respect for this shit
[chorus:]
Bust one for me, bladow!
All my niggas holding they gun with me, bladow!
And resting and stacking they ones with me, bladow!
My peeps who hang around where I'm from with me, bladow!
Who run with me, bladow!
Bust one for me, bladow!
My bitches that'll fuck till they cum with me, bladow!
Wylin? at me, having they fun with me, bladow!
In this club all they keep beating they drums with me, bladow!
In a slung with me, bladow!
Bust one for me, bladow!
And now we mash y'all
Harass y'all
Until the shit we doing pass y'all
You know we steadily, readily
Give it to niggas
And blow up the spot for niggas
Before we do the dash y'all
Yo
Ain't nothing wrong until we perform
Y'all niggas know we bout to blast y'all
Fast
Me and my niggas crash the party
If my niggas were shitters
Splash bitches before we flash y'all
Now what's up
All of my niggas salute
Where we get busy
Gimme me my loot
All way up in a box with a suit
Shit that I tell you will all be the truth
Stay on a live nigga recruit
And take y'all niggas back to the root
Tying my laces all up in my boot
All the bitches say that I'm cute
Blowing on it just like a flute
And now
Before we blind y'all
We shine and remind y'all
Should be gappy
Always one of a kind y'all
We constructing a new design y'all
Better keep up my niggas
Because you will get left behind y'all
Let us bust a bottle of wine now
And celebrate in the name of them niggas
That control the times now
Now watch it
As we just pick up the pace
You just might a hole in your face
My crew might take a whole of the space
Completely
Obligated just to keeping you dumming
And get the breaking all the shit up in club
Once you know that we coming

Floss like a bunch of young black millionaires
Makin ya run, me and my Dunn, stackin my ones
Floss a lil', invest up in a mutual fund
Blowin the horn, a sense of every day I was born
Never dream I see a nigga landscaping my lawn

Aiyyo, aiyyo, watchin my dough, sippin my Moe'
Slippin in slow, them pretty bitches sayin hello
Anyway go 'head and diss, play your Oil of Olay
Little honeydip within a little Cariola

Swear to only give you hot shit everyday

Stayin Alive, you know only the stronger survive
Holdin my heat, under my seat, whippin my five

Cuttin you up, the new shit, ruckin you up
Fuckin you up, my black hole, suckin you up
Back in the days, a nigga used to be ass out
Now a nigga holdin several money market accounts
Blaze the street, and then I would just like to announce
Feelin my groove, my jigga jigga makin you bounce

Step up in the club, take me to my reserved seat
Comin around, all of my niggaz surround me

But things like together forever to you my only one (only one)
It was special I can say it was another one

It's about two in the morning

But never the less here goes to show my potential
And even though our love was three-dimensional
One (me) two (you) three (your pops) now what am I to do
I had to transform into educated lad
Going around doing chores for your dad
Playing a duck, wearing sweaters and shoes
Chilling with pop just listen to the blues
And talking to your mom about a love for her daughter
Suggesting to me that I just oughta
Watch myself
(inch by inch)
Watch myself

So I did

It didn't do a damn thing
But a case to complain, so now I sing

Always misbehaving and mischeivous
Causing aggravation I'll never pause
Pushing out spit balls through plastic straws

For ligthing up the courtyard grass
(hey)
Teacher, teacher, go to the flesh

The teacher try to tell me I was pharoah
(no no no)
I'm not with detention no no with suspension
A child's wickeddy wild the calbridge hill styles
Teach us just a knowledge to go talk to my mommy
Now when she gets home, she's gonna wear out the body
I hate this relationship, the mom and teacher
When she reaches home hey yo she knows that I reached ya
Ok, of today I am the new school, pray
Between my momma, teacher, and my dad hey yo
(it's just another case of that old pta)
[charlie brown]
Aahhh
Yo teachers hate me the girls don't take me
Because I'm c brown
(class clown)
Gettin still aah sometimes I chill yo
Depending on the day and (how I feel)
Sometimes I leave an apple that's rotten and (brown)
No where to be found
Poll tax on sheets, five days a week
Arrive in the lunchroom, I gotta get some sleep
But I didn't do it
(you did it)
I'm suspended
(you was wit? it)
And now it's time to pay for the crime
That I never got caught like judge wapner
(bam! take on the court)
A room of teachers, parents, and preachers
A principal and one kid dress in sneakers
Case of brown versus the board
(order order)
Yo twelve, verse one is a slaughter
I pleaded my case
Aah
Face to face
Aah
It was a waste
And everyone was in place yo
He announced me guilty you have
(three hundred sixty four days)
Of detention to serve
(some nerve)
I felt this could be from (pissed)
The head of the board said ""case dismissed""
As I walk out the room I hear them say
Aahyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaaheeyaahee

Verse One: Greg Nice
Sometimes I feel like Bobby's World
Rocked the mic, before jheri curl
Single, mingle, no main girl
On the low, like Secret Squirrel
Uhh! It's time to Patti Duke
So shake whatcha mamma gave ya like Luke
It's Greg N-I always down to juice
Too much Hennesey make ya puke
Now I bust on indo dreams
Uhh, I don't be fuckin with keys
Rock the shell-top, or pin-striped Lee's
I could write a song make a hundred G's
You went back to high school, nuthin but a tease
Know I got stones, call me Mr. Please Please
Walkin down the street wit yo'
box in your hand... hot damn!
I never drove a Lex dog, never drove a Land
or a Testarossa, rather puff L's
and I sip on mimosa, bedroom wall

That's the way it's supposed to, makes ya hot
Much hotter than a toaster, style elevates
like a roller coaster

Verse Two: Busta Rhymes
Yo, the greatest unsolved mystery
of how I rotate your chicken golden rotissiere
Freak the cheesecake flow from here to Sicily
You really need to get offa my, hickory-dickory
The main attraction, even freaks the close caption
Snap break a piece off, a little small fraction
I still fulfill your dissatisfaction
I'm in the process, of completing a transaction
Huh, Carnegie Hall, like a opera singer nigga
Still doin the yes y'all, uhh!
Today we bust guns in the future we bustin lasers
Out of range in case you tried to reach me through my pager
I'm bout to blaze ya, with the flows that will amaze ya
Hot to death nigga, call me Smokin Joe Frazier
Seal up the box and present the closed casket
Busta Rhymes got the boombastic fruit basket
Bend your ass back, stretch you like elastic
More drastic when I be feelin fantastic, uhh!
Caught the chills stack the large bills barbeque on the grill
Me and my niggaz grant wills
Niggaz talkin shit but they ain't got no skills
Lookin like they full of shit your niggaz named you no frills
Don't let me catch you takin for granted
When my lyrical cause will leave y'all niggaz stranded
Distributed by, Warner Elektra and Atlantic
Niggaz thought they could fly, but really crash landed
Hah, when I'm in the place I'm up in your house
All y'all corny motherfuckers need to shut your mouth!

Verse 1:dinco d
They got my brother locked down in connecticut.
Confederate ""d¡± we can better it.
But yo, I'm illiterate to the little bits.
Until the fat pigs billys bent philly.
Scent when way I went rent make
Me think dip dy dip to the socialize
Of americal not america mer
Medler rich peddler ""hold up¡±
Which ways up whatever high
Heather by bush push push push in
The bush mop drop the pains.
In ink a document approximate
It's a quarter to cut throat headless
Hole bedless tall I figure factor.
Crack the smack police man better be
Strap step step yep it's a hit hit.
Run run, ha hon it's another father's
Saw son from behind caught up in time. but my mind and his mind make all
Mind equal, but it's a daily reminder.
Verse 2: busta rhymes
Escape from the killer tree, yes.
Everybody run and come follow me.
Sit back as I reach, and I come and attack.
Other forces trying to reveal my other
Sources, following my courses.
Fiding on the back of horse.
Trilly, trally, I dilly, dally my way.
Through the alley.
Remember that we will wreck from the east
All the way to cali.
To those that are hungry, come get a
Taste of this sound,
Hey people you know that we're
Gonna get on down.
This is your daily reminder, so
Remember as we move right to the center,
You know we gonna be your number one
Contender.
As I capture through the rapture.
Subliminally undercover, yes my dome is
Chrome on the front of my album cover.
As I mention, people follow the ways of imperfection,
Float like suspension, oozing out of a pimple like infection.!
Hip-hop resurrection, at the drop of a quarter,
Drop another rhyme with a new order.
Come follow me, come follow me man,
Doing everything that I can so we could live a little better
If we only could remember.
As we find the original 3-ring binder
Rewinder the time back to the original daily reminder.
Verse 3: charlie brown
May I say the rythm will flow and then
You will know that's it's ok.i'm rippin?
And rhymin? yes never the less everyday
Hysterical lyrical miracle l.o.ns., l.o.n.s.
Yes, yes, y'all y'all. yes yes, y'all y'all.
The boogie tie brown, the boogie tie brown,
My manifestation hits. the monitor milo always on the mix.
The capitalistic unrealistic move with tie.
Pitch in style step with tie rep and rec.
Flip to the vibe I bet girls river
Wet quiver yet don't sweat. of course
To the source just move with the force.
Oof course across what do you know
People they got feeling p! ros jos! froze
1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 coming stunning. 1 and million plus
We're raw wanna make ?em live side to the side is doom and
There'll be no more games like keepers or finders you're
Taking off your binders 'cause it's a daily reminder.
Day in. day out. (out)

I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Let me talk to you, when it feels like the sun ain't shining bright enough
It's like the devil's trying to work to give ??
And though I'm blessed, I still gotta handle of things I go through
It's good to have a friend, with another perspective to show you
Someone you know that knows you, and gives you motivation
Someone that you can go to, and vent your frustration
We always talk about our peeps, how we be everywhere
When you need 'em the most, are they really ever there?
See , every thing be all good when we be havin' fun
The difference is really needing a friend than having one
It's good when your peoples are there to help your problems
And help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
Look at hear, let me keep it at 100 and let me tell ya
How you hold me down is something I genuinely value
I got a clearer view, and being that you're always here for me I'll be here for you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
Well, how you been baby? But I'm sayin'
Even though we probably link up every now and then
With minimal convo, look it's real good to see you friend
Something that we allow that I don't even have to mention
Is whether or not you got me, that's something that I never question
Sometimes I feel that the people that I love don't appreciate me
And some hate to see the shit I've been going through lately
See you was here, when it started to haywire
You're still here, walkin with me going thru the fire
And I really love you for it, I know you all relate too
On everything that I believe and I appreciate it you
And just for that, it don't matter you can put that on my name
The way you rep me, let me be there just for you the same
Sometimes the pressure and the pain, it be wearin' me out
But I thank you for just bein' there and for hearin' me out
I got a clearer view, I thank God that you're here for me and I'm here for you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
I, look in your eye, and I see the pain in it
Life's a game, maybe the game did it
I know I changed, they say the fame did it
Life's changed, maybe the game did it
Two friends, now in two different places
And the mister catchin' planes, and you catching cases
Friendship, we never based it on position
No matter the game, we both shared the same vision
Decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
I would come to town and never get up, with you
Around then, things weren't so simple
I had my own issues that I was trying to get through
Outside chatter, messing with our mental
On the chase of ?? trust, you can't forget to
It's the real friends, that you've got to tend to
No matter how far, just know that I'm with you
I made a decision, despite all the things that we go thru
I'm going to take more time with you, and be a friend indeed
I made a decision, that everything will be alright
Going to stay strong and keep it tight, I'll be there indeed
I made a decision..

Huh huh-huh, huh huh WOOOH!!!
WOO-WOO-WOO-WOOH!!!
WOO WOO WOOOOH
Yeah, everybody, c'mon
Here we go party people WOOOH
Pull up in the whip, pop the trunk, feel it?
Fear for the will of baboon funk, ya hear it?
Me and my nigga Richie was itchy to meet some women
Met some chickens, they was actin so snobby and bitchy, fuck it
Pass me the sticky,
the chicky wanted to leave me with a kiss and a hickie
I ain't wit it but give me a quicky
I ain't in to doin the licky-licky
even though you be lookin so pretty,
I own all of my shit, never 50-50
Oodle noodles all 'dose fools never refuse
Accuse me for the bruise
Chick outta rattle and sound, better tighten the screws
Runnin and gunnin, kinda stunnin
the way we be comin around, slummin, wylin and dollin
My nigga Horace kick up a nigga like Chuck Norris
Got some other niggas lost way up in the forest
Hang you up in a harness, label me and all of my niggas the hardest
Fuck around, be the next  Formerly Known As  artist
Layed out with a goddess, pretty lilly Adonis
Besides all of that, niggas is 'nomous, I make you all a promise
The promise is that I'm so dominant and that I am so prominent
captured the whole of Asia as a continent
Oh shit, I be comin and tumblin down
rumblin, stumblin down
Freaky prophet with unusual musical sound
Bringin the ruckus, you motherfuckers be givin me pounds
So many sound, give me the camcorder and a city with plans
Me and my fam, hustle and tussle in makin this groove, me and my mans
How we gon' do this? (MAKE THEM MOVE)
Keepin it live (WHERE MY NIGGAS IS AT?)
Stackin my paper (PUT IT AWAT SAFE)
Straight buckwild, let me see your hands
What we gon' do? (DO IT TO DEATH)
What we gon' do? (WE GON' DO IT TO DEATH)
What we gon' do? (DO IT TO DEATH)
What we gon' do? (DO IT TO DEATH)
Yo! Pin or a needle, make you wobble or weeble
Niggas is feeble, back in the day I used to get money illegal
Get some ass, cop a room down at the Regal
Hit you wit so much drama make niggas always wait for the sequel
Yo there ain't no equal on how we be reppin for the people
Yo there really ain't no equal.....
Ask Hillary, met her down on Flatbush and Tillory
She killin me, got me crazy, wylin, actin straight grizzly
We never made it too far together,
I left her standin on Franklin and Willoughby
Another mystery to me
While she still on the corner kissin at me, hissin at me
Ignorin these bitches, they're angry, now they're riffin at me
Vital and critical, literal lyrical, make niggas pitiful
Go to the clinical, examine your physical
Frightening and enlightening at the same time
Get the goods and price them, and doin the heist again
You thinkin we would be nice again
We on a mission, we don't need none of your advice again
Hold me down BABY, pitter patter, you chitter chatter too much
I'ma splitter splatter your blidder bladder,
make you spill out your guts
How we gon' do this? (MAKE THEM MOVE)
Keepin it live (WHERE MY NIGGAS IS AT?)
Stackin my paper (PUT IT AWAT SAFE)
Straight buckwild, let me see your hands
What we gon' do? (DO IT TO DEATH)

With your similar features like Olivia Newton-John
Damn, OHH!  I make the whole place warm, then

Now, stay tuned to every Busta Rhymes, coming soon
I will King Kong on niggaz like guerilla monsoon, soon
Whoaahhh, what seems to be the whole analysis?

When I step in the place you should keep your mouth closed
Take your fat finger out your nose
You should just pay attention, and watch how I wild on records
Make you sing, ""The Lord is my shepherd!""
In the process I do away with all nonsense
Hit you with magic like my name was Pocahontas
The dread, gon' make you party til you dead
Niggaz quick to talk shit.. OOPS!  Upside your head
Put your head to bed -- let me do my thing -- nuff said
Shit so hot make your chickenhead do the spread
Tell me what you said -- I said I never leave you misled
While you bullshit, I'd rather get the lucci instead
Hah-huh-hah-hee-hah!  Flip until you fall
Whylin in your whip, til you crash into a brick wall
Through the nine-six, I be that nigga that be priceless
Always blowin up your spot, bringin more surprises
You, you know you really need to come clean
Let me do my thing, don't you even try to intervene
I will endanger your species like an ostrich
Hold you hostage, and crazy feed you swine sausage
HAH!  I be the number one chosen just to keep you open
Chill with your thoughts I got your brain frozen
Pay the prices made the needed sacrifices
To present the grand opening of Flipmode Enterprises
(in background: Watch me get down and just do my thing baby) *8X*

Just tell 'em they're number one (el capitan partner)
You're a champion (yeah, the Ali of my day, you know me)
Don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over!
(I can't hear ya, I'm way up here, what you say?)
Just tell 'em they're number one (it's over for who, numero uno partner)
You're a champion (ha ha ha, let's go Bust!)
Now, there's, nothin you can do to stop a nigga from within
With the hunger of a lion I secure another win (hey!)
So passionate, you might even misinterpret it as arrogant
I'm goin in (hey!)
I'ma make the world feel my pain
while I'm showin you my muscle and I hustle through the game
And even though they leave us in the hood like we ain't SHIT
We ain't got nothin but EVERYTHING to gain
Look, even if a muh'fucker try to pop me
I'm so BLESSED - do anything that you could do to stop me (STOP ME)
Now I'm climbin up the ladder and I'm jumpin at the top
You might wanna call me - ROCKY
See there's more of us - UGLY
You don't really wanna war with us - TRUST ME
So glorious, that we from the bottom
Still we victorious - HUG ME
Chorus
I see it in your eyes, it ain't hard to tell
They're watchin you (can't nobody ever stop what I'm doin)
They just tellin you lies, they want you to fail
They're plottin on you (and they can never stop my movement!)
Sooooo, don't believe 'em when they try to say it's over

Hey, see the websites lyin tryin to block my shine
Don't you know you never will stop my grind?
In a drop-top flyin like I don't got time
Got e'rybody surprised that I won't drop dimes
What's on yo' mind? Best get me off it
At least quit lyin if you must keep talkin
Go on with the nonsense, best keep walkin
Boy how you sue us, send the lawyers to the office
A lot of y'all got sprung like that shawty
Couple months off, I'll be right back shawty
With a brand new swag and a brand new .40
And a brand new ride, give a damn who saw it
Nation-wide news, nigga yeah you saw it
Shawty need a bodyguard for his bodyguard, don't he?
Tip fallin off sound kinda odd, don't it?
Y'all hate to see me ball? Take it up with God homie
Chorus
Any situation where you might get FED UP
Gotta stay focused, homie keep your head up
It don't really matter what the next one is doin
Homie gotta handle your business and then you better STEP UP
Live to the fullest for the dream you're pursuin
Ain't nothin in the work gon' really stop what you're doin (OHH!)
Go hard no matter what they be sayin
Nigga don't quit cause you know we gotta keep it movin (OHH!)
Take a look and see yourself in me
Cause it's all about we (WE)

FLIPMODE MOVEMENT - bounce in your truck to us
Y'ALL GET STUPID - don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away
Now I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal, ridin through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seein when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, struttin in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggaz on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggaz, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
And wh-while I'm stockin this bread, keep ah-stockin the lead
And leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head
Chorus
Ill Will, Flip-mooode!
I'm the enigma, there is none harder, smarter
Martyr, Godfather, my interest, your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster, catchy
Like sleepin under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murcielago, ghostin them narcos
Toast in the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect, mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist, Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn, no creepin on me whenever I'm bent
My mind spray, my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin, keep pushin them drops
Nas, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop
Chorus
Now I'm hot, and we runnin the block
Watch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot
DRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love totin the glock
Helps me feel safer when niggaz try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock
Niggaz know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head, kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel
Get Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril

Ground Music, Flip Mode, Aftermath, here we go
Back with the most venomous rap
It be the godfather of the club banger let me hear you clap
You can applause and from the very beginnin'
You can give me a standin' ovation while I'm bangin' your face in
With another banger I call it the cliffhanger
Watch me mangle and strangle this whole rap shit
(Come on)
You could see the way I make 'em mad sick
From down bottom the way I got 'em give me my cash quick
(Come on)
Log on you better grab onto somethin'
Because I'm 'bout to shake shit again and make 'em black bitch
(Come on)
Now you hear the shots ring off from bitches takin' everything off
Each other got 'em whylin' runnin' for cover
The King Kong, Big Foot gully with a scully
Bully of rap still ugly with the money runnin' the trap
Now they givin' me dap, as far as I'm concerned in this mu'f**ker
Like how I got 'em now they ready to snap

Hands in the ceilin', you know we only come to rattle the bulidin'
And break it on down just a little once again
Knowin' we holdin' the bank so let me keep the dice rollin'
And keep it traditional the way I keep my money fallin'
While you slackin' on yo' mackin', Duke, we always keep it goin'
Right to the left, do it to death, now watch me
Come through with a chisel that make the game sizzle
And I, pull out the skillet, prepare for the cookin'
How I'm whylin' niggas wonderin' when I'm gonna bring the hook in
Thugs ice grillin' every time they get to lookin'
Got 'em whylin' overseas all the way back to go Brooklyn
Now they ready to spaz 'cause we bring the best to them
Shit that shut it down on the regular
That's with the fly 80s' nigga that was whippin' in a Cressida
Fresher than, most of these niggas, killin' the rest of the
Fellas that was thinkin' that they as rushin' in and bustin' in
But the way we was doin', we was musclin' their hustlin'
So don't touch me nigga

Don't touch me nigga

You don't really want it my dude
I'm sayin' most my niggas is rude
And when we come we eat a nigga food
Back to the fact in the matter at hand
For me to come in control this whole shit, was only part of the plan
The other part of the plan is for you to understand
That nothin' could f**k with the kid, let me say it again
The Broad Back B, Busta Bus back to put out the trash
And just for the record, we got it on smash, now
How the f**k they even got the audacity
The fire marshall come and try to talk about capacity
Every time I'm in the spot, I hope you know it has to be
Extremely packed to shut it down, you'll probably cause a tragedy
Don't you know that when I'm in the place I change the mood again
I be whylin' wit raunchy bitches and a bunch of hooligans
Now don't get it f**ked up just because I flaunt it
Niggas think that they can test me, bring it if you really want it
See I be the type to always beat you to the punch faster
I keep a smile on my face, but carry the Bushmaster
So don't touch me nigga

Don't touch me nigga

Keep it goin'
You already know I said it word to mother
Shit is so hot you niggas think it's cold in the summer
Shh, calm the noise down let's get a little quiet
'Cause the neighbors call the police they know we cause riots
And they know that we'll have them thinkin' they dancin' with the devil
When they play the music turn the volume to the highest level
You got it right
Let's keep the bomb goin' like we lit a stick of dynamite
Bow you know you need to follow whenever you hear the God spit
(Aww shit)
You see me nigga back in the cockpit
Out to gettin' this money I give you all a stock tip
Perspire by a nigga till you see the sweat drop drip
So don't touch me nigga
(You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga

It's gettin' hot in this bitch

Hitting you off baby you do it like this yo
Crazy maybey a nigga look shadey
Admire the nigga and let me shine baby
Shine my nickel 380 yo it's all gravy
Never play me, follow orders you better obey me
Sisco and dance all in the discos
Crib show with alot of bitches from here to frisco
Yah-yay my nigga or yippe yai yo
Met a spanish chick I think her name is santiago
The way she blow I never been blowed before
Beyond a level where I could'nt take it no more
Put it on shorty then I bounce through the backdoor
She said hold on baby come here blaze it on the floor
Now I finish with that
Nigga give me my trap
Staking whole lot of money get me before I finish my rap
Think your shit don't stink
Drunk crossed eyed nigga
Walk crooked still spilling your drink
Jam on!
-busta rhymes chorus-
Everybody's on the line outside
Make you feel good make you come for the ride
Going do it to my people till your're satisfied
Cant do it like this no matter how much you try
I know you want to wild out come inside
>from the left to the right lets coincide
All night flipmode coming open wide
Wave your hand up in the air until your hands get tired
-rampage verse-
Now I'm on charge
The party's going down at the club mirage
Rampage I'm still large
Coming in the door with my flipmode squad
Vip pass flex on the blast
Honey's in the corner yo I got to think fast
Play my game right if I want some ass
If I want to spend some cash, moet all night
Dont look at me wrong man your pokets ain't tight
I got a rolly that'll shine all night
This is that jam that make you ballers want to fight
And all you pretty ladies just wild for the night
Put your bottles in the air from your left to your right
Its rampage you can call me legendary
I drink alize with a little cranberry
I clear my throat
Got the flyest mink coat
I told you before yo I'm going for broke
Gebose
-repeat chorus-
-lord have mercy verse-
Rotate the club
Locate the love
Pulsate with the squeeze ass
Double g cans fatigue shafts
Out your league math
Jeeps crash dent like bean bags
New york city rub squishy touch and theme tags
Not a dollar to loose
Man let me hollar at you
Never head wobble with fool
Tomorrow was cruel to flock on the moon
La la bye messaging your crew
Travel at high speeds
No id
God on the move
Pardon me duke
Nationwide thick base collide
The gritty groove, smash fifty-two
And levitate your side
Who want it?
Your back weak running like athletes
Get on it
Huh blaze the streets with no warning
Andale andale my people move for the montary
Jack cheese collapse streets now put the john away
Put the john away, put the john away
-repeat chorus 2x-
-busta rhymes-
Yeah flipmode raw deluxe hot shit
1998 1999 year 2000
Say what lord have mercy
Say what rampage the last nigga
Say what busta rhymes the lyrical
Say what say what say what

Type of nigga to torture your ass, stick some shit in your cutical
Wait a minute, let me talk to all my niggas at hand
Im'a hit all of my niggas, ya'll just follow the plan

Fuck the slouches, we keep it moving and no looking back
A lot of lost motherfuckers stuck on what they gonna be

To all my niggas, let them do your thing and get yours quick
whole plan, the whole shabang, nigga fuck the bullshit

we demand to stab you in the back and smile in your face
take all entire niggas off the face of the earth
and do away with all them niggas before i get to them first
so throw it, niggas dont get it and run right thru it

survival of the most fit for real niggas, no doubt!
get whats yours from out this fucker before your time run out X2
and get whats yours from out this fucker before your time run out
Welcome all you motherfuckers to a global event warning
Here has now come the dawn of the new millenium
The extinction level event
All my motherfuckers stay tuned!

Once you inhale smoke from my flow, CARBON MONOXIDE!
Use your imagination, let me take you higher
Rain hail snow earthquakes, Earth Wind   Fire
Yo, hit the dirt, get on the floor

You should just roll out the red carpet
All movin targets, I got you open like supermarkets

While niggaz is scared to death they breathe they last breath
Days of my Life goes on, word is bond

Chorus: Busta Rhymes
You can live true baby, you can live trife
Whatever way you chose you got to leave your life
Aiyyo you're running out of time, and you bout to cross
The finish line, the finish line
(repeat Chorus)
Verse One: Busta Rhymes
And, yo!  I can't afford to waste a second
Steppin with my eyes on niggaz checkin on my weapons
Every millisecond, motherfuckers say they true to this
But when they grab the microphone they shit sound like stupidness
*beatboxing* Hah, mad to pull another vicious scandal
I know that you can't handle when I flip from other angles now
Feel my hot wax, burning from my melting candles
You can't take the heat, so you switch from boots to wearing sandals
This is for example!  Shit will make a nigga curse
When worse comes to worse, you be the first to disperse now
We don't BELIEVE your man was living like that
Hoping to find that nigga see exactly where his heart was at
It's a damn shame how Son know your style, know your name
Watch how he pull your file, make you wish you never fuckin came NOW
Even the hardest motherfucker has his final day
So kill that shit you talkin, and be about your fuckin way
Chorus 2X
Verse Two: Busta Rhymes
Yo, everyday I see you on the block smoking
With a bunch of niggaz scoping on how they can split you WIDE open
You don't even know what's going on up in your circle
Awful murder niggaz itch to leave you black blue and purple
Ahh, your man came to put you on and tried to make you bleed
Hit you with some shit that left you flippin mad in disbelief
You just can't believe that niggaz that you smoke with is on it
And the way they rass they really got to bust yo' shit!
Thought your man was joking, paid no attention to the situation
Got with your crew and just continued smoking
Now your man sit and watch you panic
In any other situation you'd be fronting like you gigantic
I guess all that fronting is your main talent
It's apparent, he can see right through you like you transparent
Hah, aiyyo you need to watch your back you running out of time
Watch your step, cuz you only inches from the finish line
Chorus 2X
Verse Three: Busta Rhymes
Now, there's about a million motherfuckers on your trail
Quick to bust your shit for every single time your words failed
I'm watchin all the moves you makin fuck the speculatin
Super-bitch nigga you just be fakin if I'm not mistakin
Every move you fake you dig your grave a little deeper
Come around me with that shit I'ma flip it to my brother's keeper
Listen to this: overstress my emphasis
I insist to fix and bring the noise as long as I exist
Now you walk around the streets with all that shit you speak
And step inside the club just to receive the illest ass beating
HOO! Take a look around you get no type of sympathy
Impatiently, I sit and watch you die in your own iniquity
Hah, now you out dead and stinkin, and your eyes are no longer blinkin
Time caught up quick, with your little BITCH way of thinkin
Ahh, watch you diminish, while your niggaz have to put a finish
On your misleading false image
Chorus 5X
Word is bond, bond is life
You shall be willing to give your life
Before your words shall fail
All those who out there frontin, misleading they peoples
Actin other than they really are
It will catch up to you player, word is bond
So that's, specifically, to all those fake motherfuckers
Living out here on that bullshit
Trying to act like they know what the fuck's going on

From all the mess, hardcoreness from all the stress
Gotsta get this flawless flow from off my chest
Whose impossible folding impossible flow
Ain't a thing in the world that ain't culpable so so

Type shape real live niggas appreciate
To the utmost I pack toast, keep the gat closed
Run niggas to the island I pack most
After the gun burst quench my blood thirst
We will be leavin' you much worse so one hearse
Yo, now we embellish fuck the jealous
And they mark on niggas now what you gon' tell us
Skydiver, short circuit just like a live wire
And give it the niggas because we got the FIRE!

All my people in the place (Iyyiiiyyiiiiyyiiiiyyiiiii)
Just put your hands up in the air
And while we blow the spot and keep it hot
You got that FIRE!

It's Flipmode Squad that keeps on right your rightest place
We got that FIRE!

Aiyyo
Rock until I'm gone
Till the party's over and he start turnin' the lights on
Type of shit, right inside your whole crew be on
Be the bullshit, so keep movin' on
No I ain't havin' it
Why you grabbin' it, my flow is immaculate
Passionate when it comes to the fire that you have to get
Then I tackle it and kill like we Jackal and Jaffolit
Rob niggas and give it to the church so they can raffle it
Now you can distinguish how
Afro-English flowin' broke in English
Witness how we stay hot and how we keep us goslin'
Women flawsin' blow the spot often
(WHAT) niggas say (WHAT) you need to calculate
Re-evaluate the shit off so we retaliate
Marinate, when I give the hustle and carry weight
And bust up niggas like you would have the Bleat Estate
It's the niggas like y'all I hits for only when it counts
Black on the set and make motherfuckers bounce
Connected the raw types of shit
To make your bitch bug and make niggas pull out cake
Hey I think it's whack yo, I stack dough, and pack a rap show
And then let all of my niggas in the back door
And let the spot short circuit just like a live wire
And give it the niggas because we got the FIRE!

Until they start takin my people to the precint

Sometimes I might even forget crew, my X-5 bulletproof, I turbo boost, and
blast right through in the ceiling and in the roof
Comin through, hittin you, and knockin other suckas tooth's

Release the heat, we lettin loose to the extreme
Me and the Iceburg X-5, bounce from the scene
Recline my seat, rock to the beat
Lyrical artist, microphone scarred up in the heat
Blowin up the spot that we hittin, know what I mean?
Got you hopin we keepin you people up like caffeine
Fly guillotine, seeing everything on my little computer screen
From here to Philippines
Keep it movin, we never run out of gasoline
Gas me, your arson, but lookin kerosene
Me and my 5 be runnin the mission you never seen
Hot shit, makin ya suckas forever fein

Hit you with an overdose of more rhyme amphetamine
Got you eye bloodshot you need visine

Taking you to the other terrain, we mash strictly for the cream
Here to kill your whole scene and your motherfuckin team
Little 'Mal, the raw dawg, I know you heard of me
You probably know some bitch niggaz who wanna murder me
Busta Reggie Murray Ramp and Mercy's all we need for disaster
For me the microphone master
Look, I crash ya, bash ya skull
Fucky with Mally G if you're trying to take a fall
Niggaz talk about killin and never get to it
Fuck the yappin, be true to it, do it
Steady scream about your East and your West side
But you ain't in it when it comes to the homicide
Niggaz better get up off that bullshit quick
Caught up in the limelight gettin way too slick
See em at the shows bout to rock they shit off
Gettin they peeps fucked up cause they block is soft
As for terror, I sever the best of MC's
Look, little Mally G trippin off these indo trees
About to murder label's jerkin but mercy us
Def Squad niggaz prophesize like the Perseus
Droppin degrees to zero with flatlines
Kill your whole entourage off with just one rhyme
One rhyme... one rhyme... just one rhyme
I don't give a fuck I kill em with just one rhyme
Woo, hah, heh, yahah, you wish that you could get with this
Terrorist, lyricist, for your era it's
My time to shine and I'm still payin dues
And I'ma be famous on either rap or the news, motherfucker
I only tell you nothin but the real it's
tight up in the struggle tryin to get this fuckin meal, why?
Niggaz act shifty so I shift a long
three tri three chrome, it's the same ol song
I seen the shades and the suedes from afar Pah
But hold up do you know who I are?
The M-A-Double, you want trouble you got it the spot is on
You blot it I got it then shot it it's hot up in your dome
Peace with the chrome piece that I pack
Remember fuck around and catch a Mack to your back
Verse Two: Redman
Who the fuck I be I, you cannot see I
Flabbergasted, blasted, my Magnum P.I.
Oops I lie, I got a cannon bout the size of Grand Canyon
I'm prime time, giving MC's Knots Landing
Duck, heavens to fuckin Merkatroid
I drop noise that employs the unbelievable
Recline like receding hairline, crime speaks fine
with a nine pull line blind keep mines up my sleeve until
you start to quiver, metabolism splits rivers
I rock so many broads I leave your entourage tender
Like bartenders mix liquor
I serve you over the rocks, I feed you to my flock, now time to click triggers
Manslaughter in alphabetical order for four quarters
raw water turn sons to grandaughters
Ah ha ha ha ha!  I bring trouble where, you sleep
So I double dare to bust you in your bubble bear, coat
Antidotes cause gunsmoke in Tokyo
MC's dosey do your mics up in this rodeo
My star roast em up by the thousands, millions, quadrillions
Shuttin down national state buildings with high ceilings
Funk Doc to the spot freeze
Creepin on MC's like Vietnamese in army fatigues
Def Squad representer
Hit yo' ass up from the bottom when you enter
Verse Three: Keith Murray
Hey yo once a crack head, always a tack head
You have no craftibility all that shit you talk is dead
As sex drugs and violence, balance the scales of reality
Y'all don't want no parts of Keith Murray
I'm nicety and sheisty, I get that ass iced deliciously
Niggaz ain't shit to me (word up)
You stupid niggaz always got somethin smart to say
And probably can't even spell TWA
My crew is like police pull up and park anywhere (ERRRRR)
Jump out and get it on right then and there (whassup whassup??)
Niggaz is pussy and ways and actions show it
Most of y'all niggaz dead, and don't even know it
And Def Squad L.O.D. for life (word up, yeah fuck your life)
Act trife I'll let my dog cold fuck your wife
Interlude: Announcer
Aiyyo, you just heard the sounds of Mally G
Redman, Keith Murray, bringin the ruckus, the Def Squad
Next up is the Flipmode Squad, this is Howard Cossell
First up to the ring Rampage the Last Boy Scout
Lord Have Mercy For, and the In-fer-mous
Busta Rhymes
Verse Four: Rampage
Two one two, I'm living life as a rugged MC
When I step up in your jam yo I'm V.I.P.
Niggaz and bitches be eyein me
I'm spontaneous, I'm wreckin brothers out the frame
Because I'm dangerous
I'm well known like Keith Murray and my boy Reggie Noble
Chickenheads get gassed, so they call me on my mobile *beeping*
I'm great distance like AT T
I stroke like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Yo I Fades Them All like my man Mally G
Whip a nigga ass for free
And makin sure he see visions of me
Rampage the talk of the town
The stalker of New York that fucks up the underground (no doubt)
I'm comin thorough like a pack of Life Savers
Ask Marley Marl who's the real Future Flavors
My technique I freak seven days a week
I'm undefeated, you can see my Quantum Leap
I'm hittin brothers where it hurt, lyrical expert
Those who got no publishing they need to get jerked (no doubt)
a hundred percent, I gets down what I invent
Rap artists be dying to a certain extent
Sometimes they use the underground to make a comeback
That shit is wack, fade away and never come back
Verse Five: Lord Have Mercy
For now and forever, it's the, evil that men do
Mental, my inner center Winter
Frosted froze crews inventor, inventor
Invader, evacuate I collapse your major
Straights and lose minds
You're splits two times, for intruders, for these losers
My maneuvers, drop like lugers
Illegal, maybe Lethal, like Gibson's
Splittin blessings, with three Weapons
Lay in the cut like C-Sections, infestin the nine-six
For you mindless, niggaz I smack spineless
Or lay back like recliners, as inject jewels
As flesh, moves, when in vaginas, oooh, oooh ooh ooh
Corrupt your minors, like New York City's finest
lineups, on LSD fine fust, in your sinus
Crush like chinas, opiuMC grinders
My dust, these rhymers I hijack like airliners
The infiltrator, creator, I'm sinful
Papers stay viscous like religious cults
Leaders that drop scriptures, and rock clips or assault heaters
My Flipmode niggaz, we're like Afghanistan guerillas
Verse Six: Busta Rhymes
If you want more information look listen and read
While I sit back and I roll another fat bag of weed
We about to take control of your set like cruise control speed
Satisfy my lyrical semen, plants my Johnny Apple-seed
Mental slave grip on your brain like white people
My music will dominate the population like black people
Utilize my efforts to execersize my inner thoughts
I capitalize on my many and various styles of all sorts
Hold down the forts smokin drinkin mad quarts
For sports talk to chickenheads in botty lik shorts
Let's get the cream so that we can move up in this fortress
Bounce to art galleries and purchase exotic portraits
Here we go again, another phenomenon when I get on
Busta Rhymes and my nigga named Stretch Armstrong
We represent the ultimate unit for the nine-season
Flipmode Squad will bust your shit for even the wrong reasons
Chaotic sample make a nigga wanna get down
Till they come through like the ATF and shut your shit down
Alcohol tobacco and firearms is how we movin
Raw rapid fire flows while the music keeps you niggaz groovin
I don't know who the fuck you really think you foolin
You're so far from up to par and your shit needs improvin
From your conversation the way you come across your shit is off
Malfunctionin my nigga you about to feel the real force
Lay you on your face while I beat you up your head with the holy cross
Exotic niggaz blastin off to the Land of the Lost
If you can't see this
I recommend some school for the blind by Helen Keller
Big ups to Lord Have Mercy, Rampage and the Cella Dwellas
Redman and the Rockafellas
Big ups to Mally G, Keith Murray sunny days and bad weathers
But still we travel the world like National Lampoon
It's Busta Rhymes for the whole entire ninety-six SO STAY TUNED!!!
Hahahahahahahahah
Flipmode  COMPLETELY getting inside that ass
Def Squad, respek

Attention please, attention please
Can I have everybody's attention please
So humorous, we laugh at all ay'all
The alliance has now been officially formed
Ruff Ryder, Flipmode, 2000, it's now official baby
It's another headbanger
Swizz Beats:
Swizz Beats, who hits on your streets every six weeks
I be on the MP so much that my wrist's weak
Ain't shit sweet, pile 'em in here
All my thugs in the clubs start wildin' in here
Now put your bottles in the air, then light your dutches
Me and Busta keep it tight like liposucion
Niggas that don't like me get the knife for frontin'
Cause one night in the club gets your life on crutches
You got that whodie, I'll cock that forty
Flyin' in the 5 with the top back on it
Stop that shorty, I know you love me
Probably sample one of my beats then owe me money
Plus you don't know me money, so stop the rumors
Before you need the janitors to come mop the room up
Ryde or Die Volume two, smash the charts
Now put your hands in the air for the black Mozart, OH!
Chorus:  Busta Rhymes
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it
(Ohhhh), Now come on
(Screeeam), Jump baby come on
Get your hands up, (What!), now all my ladies do it
Get your hands up, (What!)
Now let me walk you through it
Busta Rhymes:
Y'all niggas try to front, I'll send my crew on a hunt
Bunch of scheming ass niggas smoking gats and blunts
Busta Rhymes, Flipmode represent
For the Ruff Ryder, and my nigga Swizz
And we gonna be here to present
Y'all niggas with some other shit to bang in the street
And block the fuck out, bang the fuckin' floor with your feet
Before we bang y'all niggas all with the heat
Feed y'all niggas more gutters like a mutherfuckin' all you can eat
And make you bounce how poncho will play the congo
And bang on the bongo, free to bounce on the bongo
From New York to Colorado, so just follow
I'm living for today and livin' tomorrow
Open up your mouth, I got somethin' big for you to swallow
Blow you through the chest with a hollow
Like the foul shit you waste and transpired right infront the impalo
Yo, the general Busta Busta shock and memorable
You know we precious like minerals, and deadly like burials
Chorus
Swizz Beats:
Listen, Flipmode and Ruff Ryders bang out hits
S-W-I two Z's bang out clips
Bang out chicks, for fun we bang out whips
Y'all go to war with revolvers that bang out flicks
Now find me on two-fifth in the summer when it starts
And iced up, nice cut, new pair of Jordans
Thinkin' of extortin, nigga your life ain't important
Your camp hotter than ours?, the fuck y'all snortin'
My thugs bang out bricks, swing, mix, throw dem grams
Hash smokers, hopin' more and out of soda cans
(Yo Swizz, I heard you stole), Whoa! listen man
Mindin' my business will make you a missin' man
See the wrist and hand?, got plaques on the wall
And a fifth in hand, I'll put your back on the wall
Nigga don't ask me no more about nuttin' you hear
Just scream and shout and just wild in here
Chorus: 3x
New York, they ain't ready for it
A-T-L, they ain't ready for it
Oh, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it
Whoa, Oh, Oh, they ain't ready for it
My ladies
Millenium
Guns bustin' plenty of them, y'all hear that

It's the musical felon, the black John Lennon
who keep the gat between the brief and the denim
The way the world is headed, I can see how it's endin'
but I'm gonna get this paper from now to armageddon
My mental's too strict, my squad is too thick,
I fucked up and slipped but I quickly caught a grip
Since my man put me on, (""Eh-heh."") I took another route
I'm wreckin' shows you know from here to over South
Them mothafuckas know exactly talkin' about
Spliff Star, see me on MTV
Fuck that! I'm comin' to gain on Soul Train
Now I'm gettin' paid like that nigga Damon Wayans
Fuck that! No more stress on the brain!
Fuck that! No more sellin' cocaine!
I'm out there, I'm out there on the radio
Catch me in the video doin' my thing
Still smokin' crucial bang
Just came off my P-O (""Yo!"")
I'm in my basement writin' 'nough flow
That's right, my fuckin' brain's open
Got you jealous niggas on the sides slopin'
Smell the weed I'm totin'
It's stink like skunks, I'm beatin' down you punks
Now shut the fuck up! (""'K up! 'K up! 'K up..."")

While we continuosly stay sculpturing bombs
Love, unconditional greetings with opening arms
And for my worthy niggas i'm a die tyrin for ya'll
With the blessing of an angel tear cryin' for ya'll
Back to the foundation, takin you, wander back where it all started
With a whole new beginning and a brand new hunger
Starving to where my skin was suffocating my ribs
Now we got bitches interior decorating my crib
Touch the love I got like you holdin my heart in my hand
And watch my manifest that shit was all a part of the plan
The fashion that I choose to deal with this shit
Sometimes it's so hard to describe the passion that I feel for this shit
How many struggles I survived just to eat this meal
Never thought ya'll maybe thinkin' that it could be this real

Too late for turning back my nigga cause we takin' it there

Strictly raw shit is what niggas be seeking me for

C'mon, yes! and ya'll off to the next step for sure
Rep and make you wanna accept more
Niggas analyze the jewel that I reveal in a rhyme
I'm like something that has evolved about a million times
Peep the display with all the new features
The way we really doin it, these mu-fuckas probably wouldn't believe it
Flipmode Squad by all means I pledge of allegiance
With the great feeling of people like the comin' of Jesus
While a lot of other niggas don't be telling you nothing
That be the same bullshit that's always pushin' my buttons
Godly is how we rep this undeniable force
You like a weak preacher, sware, you smack dead on a cross
Smack ya fingers for tryin' to put your hands in the sauce
Sometimes i think that it would be best if you run
And do yourself a favor, cause you got your whole life ahead of you son!
A whole new thang starting for me
Smell so much ass in a spot, the beat got the world fartin' for me
When I spit you know I always love to gun a shit hard
While you loving, hating niggas trying to tarnish the God
I know some dudes that would love to bring the hatred to ya'll
While I continue to bless you with shit that's is sacred to ya'll
Even if I had to bend you in place
I always put it down and rep my niggas from the most genuine place
From my street corner niggaz to my live niggas everywhere
Too late for turning back, we takin' it there

Overall niggas need to get up off the wall
If they wanna brawl missy give me a call
Yo, not at all everytime I raid the rift
Before we bust yo? ass better plead the 5th
Shut your mouth you niggas talk to much in my house
Me and missy lets get this money thats what I'm talkin about

My palms release the bomb
Reviving the alarm

Dont want you darkin shades, there's to much smoke up in your eye
Keep it swingin listen to all of my bells ringin

Move you off the block
The unorthodox general
Flash flood when a crowd
Patriotic for the intrepid style and wreck more kids than pedophiles
Niggaaaaaaa, for ever trapped in danger
Emaciate when I take my razor
Sharp heards that scare herds
Niggaaaaa, I'm from the wicked city
When chickens twist trees and dick tease
Breast feed, Betsy's with asthmatic chest wheeze
Lord Have, cardiac arrest freeze
Please, bastard handicap crews that stay soft
It's mayor, Adolf
School your army, ya squad weak
Remove four camps when I say
Pumpin arms like nor plants
I conquer and hold
Home sweet home down with monster control
Still they in the cut like runnin the coal
And still we must bring the ruckus to all you motherfuckers
Automatically, assault and battery
We battle thieves that get tragically slap to sleep to relax the beef
Collapse like weak cancerous lungs
Scatter, we numb
Blind feelin nap with jarred villain that alarm buildings
Con scrimmage, woke up a lot of children
Dirty-ass Vietnam village
I finish and outsuns
Then fold, like Mr. Malcolm at the venetian blinds
By all means necessary I reach for mine and
lift golden showers from roof tops
And give orders, rugged pound acre
Drown violators in buckets of piss water
[Chorus] - repeat 3X

Busta rhymes comin through get down (get out, get out)
What the deal now (get out of here)
Yeah, yeah
(verse 1)
Are you ready to get on? (who, me? )
I cause such a reaction makin all my people go (ooh-wee!)
Just like a group of happy children
Yo it's such a feelin
To see all of my live ballers (carry on now)
Oh see how I be gettin so passionate
I get a real eagle and I bust my shit off by accident
The God bless glory
Success story
Whiteboy better but a stash up in my armrest for me
The way I blow shit up it's like a bomb threat for me
I gotta blast and demolish everything before me
I throw your shit in the back now
You're wack now
And ain't no kind of turnin back now
So relentless
I won't even let you fools finish a freakin sentence
Call for my people like a school attendance
And then I strike with a triflin vengeance
Reppin like a winner
And do away with every last one of you wack niggas

So (get out)
If you's a fake just (get out)

The one world alliance
Flipmode the most reliant for the thorough guidance
On how to get most of this money like a secret science
Only the live soldiers allowed there's nothin you can do
Frontin with your crew while you talkin to corny chickens too
Nevertheless address the cheddar for the treasure chest
So bless the spot before the thugs close chest
One time
I hope y'all know just what the motherfuck your dealin with
Got so much platinum for this beat you thought I was a silversmith
We phat now so look at how we brought it back now
We made it possible for streets to hold a stat now
And become the wealthiest, healthiest
And bring the fire that will reach about 1000 degrees celsius
Hold on, bank this money, better roll on
Or sing a broke folk song I'll be for so long
Paid with a big brim hat just like a lampshade with bells
Wylin in the truck, the choice to roll with me
We be them new millennium prime time niggas
Walk the fine line niggas, sippin fine wine niggas
Now, if you cross the line we fuck around and blind niggas
With so much press it's like we did the illest crime niggas
What? you know I'm like a loco man, noble man
Turned global man, rippin bicoastal like a postal man
And when we come you know we came to get it
And what you need to do is bounce if you ain't rollin with it!
(chorus)
So (get out)
If you be frontin just (get out)
You need to just (get out of here)
Police you tryin to close the club (get out)
You really should (get out)

Layin in them Tahoes we own the projo's
Three for tenement we in the lobby with the big
(da dun dun dun) Don't move cause I'm a representative
Live for the street, ask, you die in the war
'member that -- blast that three atcha -- hide in the wall
We gangsta, republicans with them big things, big rings
Get your head shot off, daddy you don't believe chains
Loose cameras, big hammers, Station Wagon, blue Phantoms
Smokin the block up, y'all witness the zoo gamblers
We ain't takin no shorts, its just the early 80's
That made me, now I sit paid and then maybe
Nothing but my Lords and raps, these bags of dope
Under the mattress and I clack like a slave key
Wash your squad up, I roll double refuse to rock
Closed up my door up and murked you on the job (aww)
Gettin money like back in the days
niggaz get like shower posse in a spec of the drug games
Slayin niggaz, steady sprayin niggaz, till the task forces roll up
In unmarked vehicles and will be layin niggaz
Streched out, focus, see you come back triple
When we O.T. cut it with bakin soda, acquire now
Strategize, gettin paper like the chivey Jamacians
And them George Chain niggaz, might we set up a goal?
We got guns tucked in our waistlines, wit raps
Hangin from our back pockets miraculous money nigga
Can't stop at Sherlock - Home can go's
Medallions so big wit strings you could turn 'em into banjos
Phenomenal property, drug money, scram wrap em
A hundred EX - golden like a hundred graham crackers
Sidewindin niggaz tryna infiltrate blindside
A nigga hit you wit the eight, three in the club
Dumbin out, drunk in fronta the airbrush
Backdrop ones out, five dollars for bitches wit the guns out
Juggle for a couple days close shop thinkin,
To you the bubble until the strip is hotter than a microwave
Don't stop, travel all my spare time and keep niggaz wit us
To push shit like George Jefferson Airline
No fro niggaz better go chill, 'fore this gun
Goes up your nose like coke sniffin up your nose dude
Ay yo, snoop me kid, coop me in the red room booth
And eatin Fruit Loops its all for the loot boo
Designated hammer that'll lay ya up scrambling
Blant ninjas get 'em more popped up, and start blowin niggaz magnums up
Caught me in the mix wit some rich soldiers, that reaction
Is a key action, black sent forty doja's up
We hunt 'em like big plans, my big mans and them
Slick as the shit breaks from outtas you, rip dip, then quakes them
See I was always good at science, in the class I was hopin
Ask 'em for the chemistry temperature now I'm cookin the coke up
Used to sit and watch them older niggaz for hours
And did acknowledge to how cold water quickly harden the powder
Took your turn into somethin big to accredit (uhh)
But ya needs connect shit up from South America
Money calculations, told B.I.G. I sit up on it still
Holdin old hundred dollar bills, wit small faces

This is a Flipmode Squad
Jim Carrey collabo
Now what?
[Busta]
Ugh, hallelujah
Kids hear this come on
While I'm lacing and tryna prepare this
For y'all, oh well I got a story to tell
About a dude I met once, miserable as hell
How grouchy he was
And how slouchy he was
And when he talked, you'd smell his breath
And how lousy it was
And if you daydreamed, he'd give you pinch
Now let me tell you about Mr. Grinch
Every holiday season while we was young, growing up
Everything be cool when Mr. Grinch show up
Always plottin' and schemin' to ruin everybody's holiday season
And never had a justifiable reason
[Jim Carrey]
Yo B I had my reason
They call me The Grinch
I tried to live the given
But it was making me winch
I see happy kids whitless
""Merry Christmas"" they shouted
I stole the gifts
And there was nothing anyone could do about it
[Chorus]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus, (uh) you're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch
(Busta Rhymes, Jim Carrey, Mr. Grinch)
Mister Grinch
[Busta]
He was an angry little dude with a horrible attitude
And he'll show you some gratitude
If you let him ruin your mood
Everybody knew about him from here to Baton Rouge
He remind me of the crazy lost cousin of Mr. Scrooge
Word to mother
[Jim Carrey]
Yes, it's my favorite day
You let me take all your gifts
And just yell my name!!
(MR. GRINCH)
After that I'll be on my way
Just to return and successfully ruin your day
[Busta]
Okay for the record
What the hell made you like that?
So grouchy and grimy
How everything about you is whack
Ay yo I know you all can tell
From all the talk from his mouth
You better set some big traps
Around the gifts in your house
State of the art surveillance
Just to give it a boost
You sleep with one eye open
With a couple wild dogs running loose, now
He's definitely not the dude you can trust
He be bouncing with all your goods
And leave you biting the dust
[Chorus]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch
[Busta]
Grinch come around safe guard your things
You better safe guard your money
Safe guard your bling
You gotta safe guard your crib
Safe guard your g's
You gotta safe guard the stash and the car keys
You gotta listen up to what we talking about
Yeah it was better when the Grinch was never coming around her
Time after time again
Never mind he already took the liqour out your Heineken
He already quick to try again
To steal the gifts another way
And give you all a different style again
Why you stackin' and you trying to swell
You best believe Mr. Grinch schemin, dude stay coneiving ass
Ay yo he stay schemin' when you thinkin' he not
Looking over your shoulder
Peepin' everything you got
(He, he, he Busta Rhymes I will get you too)
Relax duke you need to chill
Something seriously wrong with you

You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mister Grinch, Mister Grinch
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel

In The Source stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loudmouths, pray to God hopin' no one's listenin'
See 50 comin' for me I'ma guard my, my position
No one'll pay attention to me, please Gotti
Here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so invincible
Now all a sudden I'm a fuckin' mad man who screams like I'm Pac
But I'm not, enemies, Hennessy
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip get me off this trip, someone stop this train

Still let me sip on Hennessy, can I sip some more?
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckas thinkin' they can stop 50, they losin' it
Lil' nigga named Ja think he live like me
Talkin' about he left the hospital took nine like me
You livin' fantasies nigga, I been checkin' deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wonderin' why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talkin', bitch, close yo mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggaz ball to let these bitch niggaz beat me

FLIPMODE SQUAD
Mutha fucker
What y'all niggas want
Yeah you know we always gonna give it to you
HARDCORE
[Spliff Starr]
I double drop kick niggas
Run around evict niggas
Give it to you full blown
Like HIV sick niggas
Act like you know B
I watch you die slowly
Tapped action
Like Charles Dick to Kobe
Was a blood spilling
Smack a faggot from the village
Steam boil cabbage
And hurt your momma feelings
Run you off the court
Defeat you at your sport
Spit, pop, and twist niggas
Like Moet corks
[Baby Sham]
What now
Hardcore sounds
We snatch crowns
Too much mouth
You lay down
We clear crowds
Send a large threat
What you expect
For me to get rich nigga
And blow off my set
Never that
I'ma rep Flipmode
Till the sky's black
Turn to macks
And hear how we murdered this track
Do you feel me dogs
Six blocks
Ninety-six buildings
Brick walls
Still push rock
Cause I'm the source
[Rah Digga]
Now
Make noise one time for the tight little swinger
Posing in flicks sticking up my middle finger
Everybody trying to get they little shine these days
Make a bitch cold flip back to my grimy ways
Ball in my court, those who lack sport
Tear they ass to the roof without the black thought
Coming on the scene thinking you the Don Juan
Type crimes have you pissing all in your Sean Don
[Busta Rhymes]
HERE WE GO NOW
Now what the fuck y'all niggas want
And how we blow
And give you all exactly what you want
SEE FLIPMODE IS THE SQUAD
Whatever niggas wanna try
We smash you in your face
And make it black around your eye
WE 'BOUT TO WRECK IT NO DOUBT
I'm 'bout to hit y'all with some shit that make you
BUG THE FUCK OUT
And make y'all niggas get real arrogant and
THUG THE FUCK OUT
And everytime we in the spot
We always smash shit and make y'all niggas
BUST A SLUG OUT
[Chorus]
[Busta Rhymes]
Here we go again
Y'all niggas know we have to give it to you

Now feel this banger while it's running through you

C'mon, yea, check it
[Verse One]
I said my solo jump off, been boomin since nine-six
My solo jump off, been boomin since nine-six
Hittin trippin the circuit breaker, flickin the light switch
The kid like is he known for givin you wild hits
I keep my name on the way on top of the now list
Bangin on every level, droppin the now shit
It's like the feelin after watchin a couple of (?) flick
And once you hear the kid, you'll be knowin the sound sick
Spaz in the club, watchin the crowd flip
That's when I knew the crown was up for whoever the crown fit
Nowadays while I go bag me a fine bitch
Bitch watchin my pocket, seein we wild rich
Shorty hopin we smellin nothin like foul fish
While you swingin ass at the devil, claimin you righteous
A lot of haters I'm knowin you like this
While you floss unnecessarily, sippin on wild Crist'
[Chorus]
I say LADIES, my MERCEDES
Hold fo' in the back, two if you fat
Feel it all in your gut, your neck and your back
When you step up in the club I know you know how to act
Hey SOLDIERS, get your floss on
Va-let in the lot, park the Yukon
Shorty shakin her waist, and rippin her thong
Now all my people are muggin and singin the song, I'm sayin
[Verse Two]
Shit still boomin in two-thousand and three
My shit still boomin in two-thousand and three
And we don't give a fuck about who you claimin to be
My jewels blind bitches where they ain't able to see
These fools try to talk just a little much to a G
They say the wrong shit, they head just might end upside of a tree
Clear my thoughts just a little, pass me a cup of tea
Takin different constant boats, from the land to the sea
I got my paper see, I ain't doin nuttin for free
Unless it's for the hood, it might cost you a small fee
Niggaz all in the street, whylin whippin the V
Clever from New York to Chicago back to the D
Check it, take it back like when I was flippin a ki
Bonin chicks, holdin titties like they was Pamela Lee
You know I mastered the art and got it down to a tee
And keep it goin add enough spice, we holdin the recipe
Big paper we makin, all of my crew agree
Stack more and bust up a bottle of Hennessy
In case you niggaz ain't even knowin my pedigree
Invested in resorts for the niggaz who go and ski
If you ain't know the streets is belongin to me
I get my people from the hood and then take 'em all on a spree shoppin
While you niggaz is busy coppin the pleas
We busy blowin frontin like you ain't knowin my stee'
[Chorus]
Yea, snap yo' fingers, c'mon
[heavy breathing]
Here we go now, yea
C'mon

Greetings, earthlings
We have now taken over your radioooo.....
(B-Real)
Goin' straight through the hole
You ain't got no game
I'm breakin' ya out the frame
Coming through like a train
Looking to take over the world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this
Get out the lane, i'm comin' through
And if you don't wanna move then i'm comin' right through you
(Coolio)
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust
Now you're whole crew is dust
Comin' through my area, i'ma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the
ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?
Chorus:
(B-Real)
We want it all (want it all!)
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor!)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore!)
In the game we take you to war (war!)
You ain't seen nothin' like this before
(all)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
(Method Man)
Insane like a runaway train i'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange
Make room, manaical monster in the game
And I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you
The Monstar again, i'm tellin' you
Pass me the rock, now i'm headed to the basket
Get up out my way is what you better do
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct
You better ask it
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift?
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer
Danger, you're dealin' with offical hoop-bangers
With hang time like a coat hanger
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk
(LL Cool J)
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is gettin' money
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies  (Uhh!)
Every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (Uhhh!)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money?
Or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (Uhh!)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I gettin' lyrical?
Daddy, I think so
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow
Chorus
(Busta Rhymes)
Yo, god bless!!
Pick up your chest
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I  bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game
You and your team just need to back off!!
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock!!
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' y'all to bring the livestock
Throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars
Who do they be?
They be the Monstars!!!!!!

Niggaz in they trucks creepin
With a fresh box of ecstasy pills for these bitches

Yeah, team select, please collect, G's connect
Thieves nigga direct the trees to the SmokeFest
Wanna take a toke? YES! The newest zone I'm in
I'm like Smithsonian nigga, fuck it call me Napoleon
Wave the torch, cut the head off the Leviathan
The terminology I'm rhymin in cause a frenzy up in Ireland
Hit ya, I'm gon get ya
And drop the bomb scripture at your barmitzvah
Yo, map shit out, blast through the speakers
With a wifebeater on, Bushe below, a new pair of sneakers
Street niggaz hang on the sidewalk, that's where I learned my fly talk
Pimp-strut, and how to skywalk
Moderatin how we establish the whole conglomerate
The way we honor it, you'll never conquer it
See how we wreck, has a global effect, on even Polish people
Young and restless down to the old and feeble
Peep them, Czechoslovakian to Yugoslavian niggaz
Be all into my bounce so don't be botherin niggaz
So NOW you should feel the whole cathedralish bounce
Put one in your stomach leave you in a fetalish crouch, nigga
My vernacular is spectacular
Strategic plans'll have you lookin wacker than a postal office massacre
Is that so? Make moves just like a fatso
Bounce in a minivan Astro after my gat BLOW!

Aiyyo, get up, get up, get dough (get dough nigga)
Roll up, light up, and smoke that 'dro (smoke 'dro now)

Yeah, my whole entire mindstate deeper
than astronomy and mathematics like Galileo
Smash you niggaz like mashed potato
Back when niggaz used to rock Ballys and Clarks
I used to watch, little niggaz shouldn't hustle nickel crack in the park
Barrels spray the brighter flame in the dark
Blood spill stain on the street, that's how niggaz be leavin they mark
Fuckin with diplomats who love Bailey's
Monopolize and quickly get other money fuckin with Israelis
So solid how we be symbolic
to a handful of niggaz that be all schemin on the same wallet
Them type niggaz that be conspirin and kidnappin
Shit happens! Gun clap for you in a GIFT wrappin
You should follow how the style switch up
Like a group of religious niggaz schemin to kill they arch-bishop
You big pussy nigga actin all hard
Call me atheist, because I don't believe in you God
It's like a grand feast celebratin the bounce of the century
I tote the recipe quick for any type of discrepancy
Busta Rhymes the great renaissance artist and architect
Like how a Felipe (?) portrait is so hard to get
We got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat
Yo, we got the obscure shit for the street
Nevertheless we split your head and your chest, now rock to the beat

motherfuckers is, niggas live long enough to look back and shit and
laugh and shit, y'knawmean?
[verse 2]
young and learnin shit that started is thick
started inquiring alot, started using my dick
like I knew it all but I wasn't really knowin and shit
buggin when my pubic hairs started growin and shit
now hold up, a young nigga now a couple years pass
searchin desperate to experience my first piece of ass
now, gettin into mischief and caught my first arrest
started smoking weed and started totin on them cigarettes
eyes bloodshot like I was starin at a highbeam
nigga only twelve so why he lookin like he nineteen?
1, 2
the fast life baby, young with an old soul
from the past life baby
a young nigga wanted things and wanted money quick
ambitious on the Amtrak, wit a quarter brick
my nigga, 1, 2
it got hot in the streets
my nigga campaign the cops who started walkin the beat, my nigga
trouble causin too much problems just me and my brother
made mommy a grandma and shacked up with my babymother
now it a seed, I was always ready to clap shit
strugglin, so then I start fuckin 'round with this rap shit
moved to Long Island and got up with a few niggas
believin we could show the world we was the Leaders Of the New niggas
a crew of niggas that was hot like an infirmary
blazin til they started actin like bitches internally
so now, Flipmode is how we own it fo' sho
tried to fuck with niggas but I couldn't do it no more
fo rilla, 1, 2
and then I got with some niggas
always wit it to multiply the gross and double the figgas
and then I, hit with bombs and hold a stack in my palms
whippin Bentleys, floss icy shit and take care of moms
give the local little old man a job as my chaeuffeur
hold it down for all my niggas til the movement is over
it's kinda beautiful
[CHORUS repeats to end]
[over chorus]
yeah, y'knawmean?
how we have acquired so much
where we can look back and, and actually laugh and lavish
in the, in the, in the moment
as we prime in life
look at how we, we struggled all this way and went through the bullshit
motherfuckin, little obstacles
situations they try to set up for niggas to fuckin fall off
and lose they hard earned shit, y'knowmean?
I holds it down for my niggas though
give my last to my niggas
all the niggas that was wit me through the whole shit
love y'all niggas, word
my Flipmode niggas, man

Chorus
See the ass? Touch me right there
Wanna touch my nookie baby? Touch me right there
Make me lose my mind baby? Touch me right there
Party over here, ain't shit over there!
See how I'm drillin 'em baby?
It's Bus-a-Bus back bitch, I'm killin 'em crazy
We off the Relaxic, I'm spillin the gravy
Got every club packed thick, creating a frenzy
To be the latest greatest for all you niggaz from gazing
Bugatti off white tan, interior pastry
See my swagger sharp like that, these niggaz amaze me
As a matter a fact just salute me and praise me
Enough of that
We be up in the club, niggaz sportin them minks
Tipsy in the club, nigga buyin 'em drinks
Walk around lookin like our shit don't stink
Ice by my neck so bright, watch 'em blink
Okay, now I got me a clear view
I like it when you get up and I'm lovin ya hairdo
The way you cross ya legs, ass spread in the chair you
The way ya clothes skimpy, so it's easy to tear through
Appreciate my presence, while I shine wit' a barrel
I came up wit' cut diamonds, obscure in a rare blue
Shorty ain't checkin for you, step to the way I do
Super senile, I ain't the one to compare to
Now she was sayin...

Come on give it to me
We got some shit for that ass
Come on give it to me
We got some shit for that ass
Come on give it to me
We got some shit for that ass girl
Bounce back, brand new on the scene what?
Took a little minute, I'm back with the re-up
Switched it up a little bit, back with a clean cut
Shorty's lost her head, see all the koochies I cream up
I love the way she in all over the girls when I'm teaming up
It's gettin hotter in this bitch, windows are steaming up
Amazed by the pinky, neck, and wrist be gleaming up
How I dominate the scene, how a nigga be cleaning up
I see you liking everything, you see me and you
You frowning on your girl, like you ain't willing to share boo
The hotel ain't far, meet me there and if you
Ya girl looking like she wit' it, she can come/cum in too
You get impatient Ma, show you just how the kid move
I'm bangin in the truck, and let her watch in the rearview
See we don't really care about the niggaz who came through
over there 'cause over here, see I'ma show ya how we do
So check it baby...
Chorus
See it don't matter what ya doin over there
See we gets it poppin, that's how we do it over here
That's if we toss bottles, that's how we do it over here
Check it, floss models, that's how we do it over here
Listen, rare throttles, that's how we do it over here

To provide us all with that bass
Especially after you finish cookin' that bass
I always been a hungry nigga
The type to set a whole entire country into a frenzy hold up
Whatever niggas wanna do, niggas wanna try
Fuck it, I'm better than the best of them
King Kong and Godzilla mixed up together
While I'm blessing them
It's wrong for niggas to mix us together
Cus I'm better than every fucking body
You should remember that I never been lesser
Always fresher I'm upgrade and bitch constantly mutilating foes
And outshining their favorite
Probably boost the ratings while I'm changing and rearranging the climate
I'm the fucking pilot
Silence, I'm so amazing and so spectacular
The way I sparkle like fireworks then I cause a massacre
And make you feel how the fire hurts
See the dungeon dragon has returned RAWRRR, look
Then I come one after the other then BLAOWW, before the hook
Then I see how the people's amazed and astonished by what I do
Cause I see how the heater just blaze and I tarnish up other dudes
Then I see what I feed to make niggas just WOWW when I'm coming through
Indeed I plant a seed that'll make 'em DROWNN when they get the news
That yes I am the best and unless you could replace
Cause I only deal with facts and the truth is in your face
I got bass (coke)
Every line is (dope)
The type of shit that make 'em feign and had 'em thirsty to (smoke)
I got a funky fresh (car)
And a funky fresh (broad)
I'm a funky fresh (star)
And I'm up to (par)
You see the trunk got bass
Yeah the pots got bass
All the niggas on the block they be dealin' that bass
You see the trunk got bass
I flood the hood with the bass
I'm bringin' the sprinklers out
Even when there's a drought
I got bass
I got bass
I got bass
I got bass
This should be soundin' like a thousand mosquitoes buzzing like hmhmmmhmmhmhmhm
I got you niggas buggin' like fucking zombies is coming
And dumbing and losing it
Got a fucking army that's gunnin' and running for rulership
I'm in a fucking party with something that's stunning' and cute as shit
I don't play with none of you dummies
Who the fuck is you foolin' with
Then I count and sum up my money
Niggas know how I do this shit
Then I bounce and I run through the country
Then I come with a slew of hits that'll massacre the planet
Obliviating the earth
And diabolically smashing everything for whatever it's worth
It's Busta Rhymes godfather beast boy emperor
This rap shit coming to get the bread
Gimmie my cash, quick so that I can be malice
You niggas now running telling do it
So I can reblanket the town with the epidemic
I got a flow that cause cancers
Better call up the paramedics
And it'll complicate blood circulation in diabetics
A lot of hateful niggas try to put my pockets on diuretics
But NAHH we don't allow them things
You and your mans can get it as you complicate the flow
To full drive when I feed my pushers then
Spit a dart like natives livin' in bushes
I got bass (coke)
Every line is (dope)
The type of shit that make 'em feign and had 'em thirsty to (smoke)
I got a funky fresh (car)

Yo bus, me and spliff, we got heaters
Everything's allright, lets get drink up inside of cheetah's

Tried to stick me for five bricks but his broads the schemer

Deeper and deeper
Nigga's vision start to black out, straight grim reaper
Still lookin for that nigga peter

Thaaaaaaat I, could fiiiind (excuse me miss)
Someone, so special (can I have a word wit'chu baby)
Miss can I get a second to speak and quietly mention
That I am so into who you are, can I get your attention
My observations of you creates conversations for you
And if you got a little time, I got the patience for you
Okay? Good, you giving me the time to talk?
While I figure it out and sort what I'm trying to say, let's walk
Just trying to keep it gutter, respectfully I won't stutter
Don't you agree, we look better when we walk with each other?
I've seen you many times, yes I've encountered many dimes
I'm feeling something special with us, it's just one of the many signs
I think that we have to look forward to our go-through
Any war with you regardless what it is I'm trying to score with you
Sometimes I think and wonder especially through rain and thunder
If I'd ever find the one to ride when I'm on top or under
Until we reach the end, ma with love as I be your friend
Oh; here you can take my number, I hope we can speak again
Chorus
No matter how mister, no doubt I'll die wit'cha
Until the end of life, lay down on the ground wit'cha
I'll give my life to you; I hope it all comes true
Ready to start for you, I give all my heart to you
And when together I hope we never fall apart you know
Now that it feels so good; our thoughts are understood
I'd like to learn from ya, but I'm 'bout to turn from ya
It's been about a week and I ain't even heard from ya
Is it something at all or did I just bump in and fall
And even though you did I see how you was reluctant to call
But it's nothing to crawl before we walk (OOH) listen
And it's nothing to stall before we talk - look
To tell the truth I'm happy I found you and that I can be around you
And thus I'm digging you, I ain't just trying to pound you
I'm only trying to crown you and wife you and wedding gown you
Regardless what I'm with, shorty seem like she always down to
just spend a little time and then CLICK, you know that kind of chemistry
The recipe to then SIP, and a little bit of wine
Mami I like your kind that light the fireworks and bombs up
The type of chick I wanna talk about when I call my moms up
Until the love is empty I credit the one who sent me
The most BEAUTIFULLEST woman and she riding with me
Chorus
(I'll do it all) I'll do it all wit'cha, go through any door wit'cha
It doesn't matter I will, go against the law wit'cha
Just know you live through me; your love is all I need
If you ain't know you make me, no one's ever shown you baby
Your dedication and commitment got me going crazy
Your love so real to me; and that's all that I, can see
This is a thing I wanna feel forever, and I ain't going nowhere
Cause you mean so much to me
No matter how my people try to doubt ya, I know the truth about ya
It doesn't matter to me
Baby I love you and I always told ya, I'm always here to hold ya
Cause you do so much for me
No matter how they try they can't deceive us, nothing can come between us
Cause you mean so much to me
Listen; trust me and I will trust you, I ain't into trying to fuss boo
Deeper than any lust, I'm only trying to mindfuck you
That's probably why and maybe I can nickname you my baby
Now that you made me a man you're officially now my lady
Despite the stormy weather I cherish your love forever
And nourish everything we have 'til we grow old together
I'll never trick you, mislead or try to be shaky wit'chu
I only wanna make all the rest of my babies wit'chu

Yeah, Guess who it is
Ayo Dre I think they in trouble
Scott Storch why you have to do it like this to 'em
Feels like a new day, listen
[ Verse 1 ] [ Busta ]
Now every time I come in I hit ya niggas with shit regardless
Uou get retarted,then you niggas aint got a clue.
On how the fuck I do what I do, and say what I say,
And spit what I spit, you aint never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that could ever convince
my villi turn the place into a mutha fuckin' zoo
Than I come in I spit cr crazy sh sh sh shit and
ma ma ma makin ni ni ni niggas do exactly what I want'em to
From my point of view instead of tryin to step up
you still tryin to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and fret and get schizophrenic
and let they emotions out and I doubt they could ever test my crew
Take a second check it I reckon my records are
better than whatever record you recorded that why your shit is through.
You fuckin idiot I dont think you get it im one of
the greatest ever period every syllable is true
[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
Now if you aint runnin you aint handicappin your vision
I think its simple and I think that its really plain to see
No matter how much you try no matter how much you make an effort
you niggas could never ever really fuck wit me.
Cause ill hurt you .. and I will learn you a thing or two
And ill hurt you.....and ill finish your career for you.....I'll
[ Verse 2 ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of
Bumblin fools who got me rumblin dudes all the way down the block.
Keep'em stumblin and jumblin over they words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin outta time sick and tired of all your
Ma ma mumblin ma ma mublin na na nigga I got it locked.
Every single time you put my shit in the cd playa and
Turn up the volume you bang your head with courtesy of knock I
Continue to crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga wit the glock
Than I watch you while I keep a fumblin while I got you
Ta tremblin for one of my niggas bust your head wit a rock
Before I start to do another thing that'll make you crown me
the king wit such a butterswing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brother bring all my diamonds the summer bling
while im climbin and from a glimpse tell you bitch to get off my yot
[ Chorus ] [ Busta Rhymes ]
[ Verse 3 ] [ Eminem ]
Shit on the mic and doodle my doo doo
You do not have a fighting chance to move you are covered in my poo poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid
Dou dou dou dou dou dou ga ga ga goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you?
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have it watch
So you just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Excuse my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
You're probably wonderin why there's thunder and everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause busa bus and flipmode just tiptoed into the club
Then with shady quietly try not to start a riot with Doc
But since we already started we might as well have a party
So gather out everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you aint got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in your closet, throw somethin on and get to the club

My rhymes profess life like the birds and the bees
Make Funk-Master Flex say yo I'm feeling these
Flows make you shit in your drawrs.  Change your dungarees
Smoking trees, getting cottonmouth, wild munchees
Bowed down the block eating food at Luigi's
Constipated... too much extra cheese
Well anyway, while I was cooling down at Luigi's
I met some Siamese twins from overseas.. Lebanese
Let's begin with the friends from New Orleans
They had a fifth friend.  She was straight Black-Portuguese
Pretty palm-olive-soaped skin, AloeVeralese
She looked like the type of chick you only see in fantasies
The type of chick you would KILL for to get between the knees
Yo.  I made time to chill with Miss Portuguese
Would you believe, the bitch tried to steal my fucking house keys
And rob me for my G's
Had to show this crazy braud, I mastered my Degree's and my Ph.D's
Got your face on camera; motherfucker say cheese
You better get with your friends quick, before I start to squeeze
Getting caught up in that freaky gold-digger Jamborees
Chorus:
I caught that ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word
That ill vibe Tip [word Bust?] yo yo word
Cause when I'm in the place you know my shit be absurd.
[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]
[That ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]
[So when I hold the Mic you know my shit be absurd]
[I caught that ill vibe Bust] Word Tip? [yo yo word]
Verse Two: Q-Tip
I got weight on my shoulders in the form of this beat
Ain't nothing sweet, on the street, for good these I compete
Come off complete
And you need to get back in your stance
We enhance and we're playing the whole world circumstance
So do good in your hood even though you puff life
Positive to comply
Don't screw up facing that crowd
Progress don't fall back.  We can't have that
I'll hold your hand Black
We can't wind up with scratch
I put my best foot forward, when I play in life
Cause this world as I live it, chill's like a double edged knife
In the jam we regulate, cause we organize
Logic-a-ly thinking when along's enterprise
Alot of brothers from the ghetto got the gift of gab
Peace to the West Coast and the East, we's fam
Need I make mention that the crew we've got
Make things get hot, like the FoFo shot.  Blauw!
No we don't premote no guns, but don't turn that cheek
In the world that we live calmness is viewed as weak
So, we got to stay awake for all these lizards and snakes
Some of them come as friends; some of them come as Jakes
We decipher all the force and build rounds with our friends
Why's that?
So we can live right until time ends
Yo why's that?
I estimate, so we can get these ends
Yo true that?
Busta and Tip, you know we make minds bend

If you ain't from the ghetto, don't COME to the fucking ghetto
But I'm gonna let one of our most immaculate tour guides
take us ALL through the ghetto - my nigga Rick James!
When I was a young boy, growing up in the ghetto!
Hangin out on corners, singin with the fellas
Lookin for the cute chicks, trying to find me big fun
Lookin for some trouble, or anyone who'll give me some
I was young and crazy! (In the ghetto)
Didn't know what my life would be (In the ghetto)
I was dumb and oh so lazy (In the ghetto)
Something had a spell on me (In the ghetto)
You all know what I'm talking 'bout (Talking 'bout ghetto life)
(Talking 'bout ghetto life)
You all know what I'm singin 'bout (Talking 'bout ghetto life)
Ghetto life (Talking 'bout ghetto life)
(In the ghetto) Sure we be Taking them chances
While we search for the answers we be smoking them cancer sticks
Police provoking motherfuckers we dancing
And we be dodging them bullets they be poppin off at us, shit
But yet we always romance the street
And fall in love with the hood 'til somebody come blast the heat
Always up to no good, so all of my fam could eat
See in the hood we hungry - hey nigga we playing for keeps
My soldiers on the block get on it
It be good if you flaunt it, we will take if we want it
See niggas from the ghetto got a different state of mind
With a different kind of hustle and we iller with the grind
And develop our muscle 'til we sicker with the shine
In the struggle, thus our money come quicker doing crime
I see the way we rep the hood, gotta love me
You can take me out the ghetto, but you can't take it from me
Gotta love it

Hustle hard, try to get money quick (In the ghetto)
That's where I got my name from
I learned to get money and I got all my game from (In the ghetto)
That's where you eat with a bunch of the wolves
And get to hustling as hard as you could (In the ghetto)
Until your cake stacking shit'll get good
Throw a block party for the whole hood (In the ghetto)
With them burnout cellys
Talk crazy, sell drugs in front of Pancho Deli
Crackhead chicks still smoke with babies in they belly
And them piss in elevators 'til the lobby all smelly (In the ghetto)
That's where I keep my ratchets
Get my instincts and survival tactics
Ain't nuttin like the hood nigga, I don't care
You surviving in the ghetto you can make it anywhere
Gotta love it
Chorus
To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
Down South niggas - rep your ghetto
To my East coast niggas - rep your ghetto
West coast niggas - rep your ghetto
Midwest niggas - rep your ghetto
To my Dirty South niggas - rep your ghetto
(In the ghetto) Even though they act rude
You'll always find a good chick to hold a brick for they dude
Behind the bullshit, me and my clique on the move
We honor the code of the street, and live by the rules (In the ghetto)
Is where, all of the hood's at
Find the most crooks and they sell the most drugs at
Where you find beautiful women and rugrats
And some of the most powerful people, I love that!

The Surgeon General.. of the Flipmode Squad..
has determined.. that the sounds you about to hear..
can be devestatin.. to your ear.. to your mind..
to your body.. to your souuuuuuuuuuuuuullll!
[Chorus: Flipmode + Meka]
You better, pack up your bags, better get out of town
Cause when the God come you know he gon' be puttin it down
Everything we do be blowin, better get on the ground
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)
He keeps it wicked by creatin the sound
That make the people wanna spaz 'til they give him the crown
Fuck around you'll turn up missin just to never be found
It ain't safe no more, it ain't safe no more (nigga)
[Verse One]
Bodies'll turn up missin, I promise you need to listen
Abolish the need for bitchin, I polish and shine and glisten
Demolishin while I'm whistlin, astonished while you're witnessed
Hardest to smash another artist son, regardless if it is
a nigga who think he the greatest son I'll lock him in the fridge
And hang him from both of his ankles when we drop him from the bridge
Blockin your paper really stoppin that dude from gettin his
Poppin the safe and splurgin, havin the crew up in the crib
Block 'til these niggaz havin 'em rockin gargle with a bib
Shittin and fartin, spittin and vomitin all in the crib
Fallin into shock from the bullets we shot up in they ribs
Hot up the block and blew up the spot and got up out the mix
Tried it a couple stops and spotted the Squad up in they whips
Plotted and then I signed on the dotted line and made a wish
Return us even the hardest makin you garbage niggaz sit
The smartest now you a target only the heartless niggaz win
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
You can't believe can you, I'm callin my dog Nathaniel
And ballin with all my mans you'll be blowin and all will hand you
Accordingly or disorderly bullets are sure to bang you
considerably my 9 milli hit you at any angle
Shootin, shootin, shootin - high, low, verticle or horizontal
And if you were makin plans I do think you gon' have to cancel
Sorry I had to ask you, save it I have to blast you
Takin a chance to laugh from you makin the masses gas you
So now you thinkin that you tough and that we can't get at you
Change up your mind and leave you stiffer than a massive statue
Tired of talkin need to use all your precautionary measures
Washin off the blood haulin the water force of steady weather
You can handle it or you can't, it be only gettin better
Like a candle, we burn your chandles and make you feel the pressure
Cockin it back, articulatin the flow just like a lecture
Break it down and rebuildin the flow, now peep the architecture
[Chorus]
It ain't safe.. in the current state.. of our democracy
Terrorism.. motherfuckers bombin New York.. shit is crazy
It ain't safe no more!
All these rappin niggaz goin at other rappin niggaz heads
Shit is crazy! But most importantly..
The most unsafe thing.. is that.. niggaz ain't seein, the God comin
Watch where you walk!

The master blueprint, one survival for all man
I self Lord am
So divide with me and my woman co aside it's one mind
Bear witness, one respect, one culture, one way of thinking, one
vision,
making the one decision, the one way of living
Common destiny amongst all
One understanding amongst me and my woman
So that we can't fall
And keep moving forward based on actual fact
Yes you'all my beautiful Mother Earth
Respect it to the max
Can't mix up or tamper with it no more
We're on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure
And whats mine is yours, specially if we move in the same direction
Just for one common cause
Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live

The way she cherish me
Fulfil my every appetite
With a good degree?
Or the ways to inspire or encourage me
The right amount to nourish me
Secure enough so I don't have to ask her where my loving went
When times is hopeless
Sometimes I had to focus on the priceless moments
When my wisdom by,? went by unnoticed
Cos you're my everything
And what is mine is yours
Moving in the same direction for one common cause

One little kiss now
As one

So let us all love, live now
Ask my son right, he bears witness to you
Being the foundation you can come home and watch the babies too
The one way we agree on how to follow tradition
This one family coming first
Play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
The mother struggle
That I see, thats why my love is for you
You always hold it down for me, so I'm a hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food that come through
Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole living condition
True indeed
I know you symbolise the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities
Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours
Moving in the same direction, just for one common cause
Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live
Just one
Come together as one
As one

Phenomenal swing like the ass on a black chick
Fat dick to all of y'all niggas with whack clicks
Hoping they whip paper like a classic
Low budget black flick
Last victim that I caught was fucking my last chick
She hit me off, nearly made me bust through my plastic
Took the loot that she had stashed in her panty elastic
She got from out my denim, little venom was fast, kid
Try to swindle a nigga by giving me putang
A new thang, chick wanted to fuck me to Wu-Tang
Thug chicks started criticizing my new slang
Started hitting the pussy the song from the wusang
Watch these rap niggas get all inside your guts man
My nuts hang
Shorty stay abusing the love thang
Gotta camouflage my stash and loot like I'm Bruce Wayne
After my money gotta kick the bitch up like Liu Kang
Aiyyo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Oh yeah
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what we asking for
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Now what you asking for
Just give it to me raw
Okay
Shorty took me on a ride like a cyclone
In my zone
Strutting with an ass and a fly tone
Hold shorty like how I be holding my microphone
We thug romancing to the jazzy sound of a xylophone
Ass backwards I'ma stick you more than a cactus
Lay my thug willy actress across the mattress
Knock it off the earth axis and broken glasses
Continue when she make me bust blackberry molasses
Pussy made me feel like I was drugged up on morphine
My movie screen ass stacking more than we've all seen
Yo, chick 'bout to make me wile on her real hard
A real fraud, fuck I ever fucked with this ill broad
Chick still after my loot, she like, ""What, son?""
Don't act dumb scheming on a robbery outcome
Come out from wherever you are and be outdone
Acting like you about something
And you ain't about none
Come on son
Thought the chicken head was a little rude
The wrong move making me whip it out like live dude
Fuck that trick tried to get at my hard-earned stack
Too many times
Gotta put my foot in her ass crack
June for all of my niggas you know shit is all real
A chicken head to fuck your mans and cut him a side deal
Of all your prized possessions if you let her get yours
Bitch we keep it raunchy everything will remain raw
Ay Yo
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
Oh yes
I come to give you a little of what you asking for
Oh what you asking for
So what you asking for
Just give it to me raw

When people askin ""what's up""
That's when I pull up, finish what I've done
Jump in the car, flip the God and roll a blunt (yee!)
You can't see, your boy's from Miami
Ears like Sammy Sosa, bitch we're takin over
Bags underneath my eyes, I ain't sleep in days
I'm in the bushes with a K, your semi's gonna spray
Eat mangos and grapes, as your body decay
Bunny holes and yay, you had us in ninth grade
Hey what can I say, alligator suflay
Pele and Moet on the dawn of day
We went from dead broke, to makin big millas
Wife beater chinchillas, life can't get no realer, nigga
[Chorus - Busta Rhymes] + (Female voice)
(Keep doin it baby)
Mystikal, Violator, c'mon
(Keep doin it baby)
Dirtbag, Violator, c'mon
(Keep doin it baby)
Busta-Bus, Violator
Y'all must know how to make 'em
Here we go, yeah, baba bap
[Verse 3 - Busta Rhymes]
This shit ain't over motherfucker, just wait a second
God of this rap, it's only right that I end the record
""Violator"" nigga, with my knife I'll cut you up
Violate ""Violator"" nigga, we fuck you up
Don't you ever think or even try to confront on a tread
Flipmode, Violator, known for just bustin your head
Huh, watch the way we drop it, we ready and able
In others words, your whole rap roster whack, give me your label
Whenever, whatever, whoever be thinkin they better
Test ""Violator"" man to merge five labels together
Flow sick, so quick and it gives me the pleasure
Got a lotta shit, flow switched like a change of the weather
Throw on my high vein cause my rhyme clean
The cop seen now you a big ride to came
Well let me hal-swing, sing along, do your thing now
Feel my sting, crown Busta-bus king now
[Chorus - Busta Rhymes] + (Female voice)
(Keep doin it baby)
I'ma keep doin it baby
(Keep doin it baby)
We gon' keep doin it baby
(Keep doin it baby)
Check it, I'ma keep doin it baby
(Keep doin it baby)
[Outro - Male voice]
Violator 3!
DJ countin the door down and the big dog pitbull
Terror Squad, shitonniggaz.com
Let's go! (uh oh)
Chris Lighty, I see you man
Busta Rhymes, Mystikal, Dirtbag (c'mon)
It's a Cool & Dre epidemic
Who wanna test, c'mon
Who wanna test, Violator 3

Aiyo, where my niggas at?
Fuck, my niggas is at?
Where my Leaders Of The New School niggas is at?
Yo, aiyo C Brown, C Brown where the fuck you at, dun?
Aiyo Milo, Milo and the dance, where the fuck you at, nigga?
Aiyo aiyo Dinco, where you at, son?
Where the fuck my Leaders niggas is at, man?
Fuck man, I'm ready to grab my niggas
Them niggas need to go to blow or sometin
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Runnin faster than the speed of a bullet)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
(Has more rhymes than any other DJ that has craps)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Able to leap sucker MC's in a single bound)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Look at the jam of the mic)
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along (It's the L-the O-the N-the S)
Verse 1: Dinco, Milo
Three in this to grass it up like me
Besides TNT, see an N and BG
My visionary which is skippin on my D-O-G
I guess it was a S-O-S from G-O-D
Chaos has arisen interteller space souls (SOULS!)
Cellular, good ridance, like keypads wit ol' bass
Third planet states while the rest of the world waits (WAITS!)
Joy to the world, meaning hell, snow and earthquakes
Participates, modulates
If comets were round plates, bitten names gates
For only those that ???? relates, case after case (CASE!)
Dinco's on the next space
Movin strategically in the Solar System's waste (RAHHH!)
Size 25, the lymph still be in place (HAHHH!)
Stretch and extending, for flexin is impending
It's not mind-bending or *?refriending?* to keep remembering (HMMM!)
Cos everybody's people gonna die, or believe (WOO-HOO!)
we dispense necessity, to shout and receive
KEEP IT MOVIN' ALONG
People in the party, are you really feelin?
We ain't seein eye-to-eye so you ain't really seein (SEE!)
I be hippin all type of niggas, sayin fuck that nigga Blow
When they see me in the party, they better act like they know
YO, we connectin dots that makes spots hot
Uhh, to the beat'cha (Y'ALL!), ah ya don't stop (STOP!)
Notice, how many groups can formulate then lose focus
With a lot of hocus pocus, concepts that sound bogus
I'm seein the world and all its different kind of poses (WOO!)
Crush you like roaches, that's keepin the crowd movin (HAA!)
Mr and the dancers, who said ""Culture consumin?""
Never face, he ????? ????? and strength
Cos I can terminate, like a dirty hypodermic needle
My vision's clearer than the sights on an eagle
Stop them bustin high, bring the head back to my table
Don't front, circle circle, dot dot, you catch your speed, not
Feel that, cos this type of vibe sounds done
(Far from the...., to the doe-run-run-run to the doe-run-run)
(YES!) Yes to the beat-boys and your ass accepted
Exclusive, L-O-N-S bringin the ruckus, wild aggressive
Chorus:
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Verse 2: Charlie Brown, Busta Rhymes
Now don't get me wrong, CHILL!!!
Let me out, no question, no doubt
????? god is a drought
I've come to wet the party like a tropical depression
????? mixed with scherm for this musical session
(STOP!) stressin, testin, second-guessin, who's 'fessin?
Life is a lesson in disguise like a blessin
Blinkin, kickin, better back up chickens
The guns stun split, I keep it real, front *?worm?* (*?WORM!?*)
Cos I'm like a ???? hands therapeutic
Measurements, square, feet, and cubic
We're all makin pennies off a record, so who needs the paper? (WHO?)
The man in Manhatten lampin in the skyscrapers
How much can a nigga take before he break fool?
I tell ya cool, with the New School
And the tool to examine my unorthodox pattern
>From Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
and don't forget Uranus, Neptune and Pluto
Flow deeper than the lava inside a volcano, bro
(Never snitch, never dominate
I'll be wild, smokin drowsy)
Fuckin up my economics, is it rather ironic
Sippin gin, juice and tonic
Like Shawn Kemp with some hemp, super sound and sonic
Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp
C-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant
Yah yah, yah (AHH!)
My shit be so ginamic
and I'ma take 4 steps and cross the whole Titanic
Better believe I (KEEP!) movin (OVER!) people ?????
You know my crew funk, bringin in full flaga'
Bringin it back like I'm fresh out the box, pair of broke ass 69ers
(IS THERE NUTTIN NEW?) All in the house so open up your blinders
Yo, I be the Moses takin poses
When the wine flows so beautiful like a large bouquet of roses
Chorus:
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin'
Verse 3: Busta Rhymes
Keep it movin now
No need to try to stop it, we gon' wreck shit anyhow
Your, limitations is somethin I never will allow
When we bake the cake, I be that nigga that brings the icing
Disregard your whole identity and revoke your driver's licence
You know I blast in your ass real fast
Got your bladder burning, desperate for a bathroom pass
My ????? like a Busta Rhymes statue made of grass
C'mon, hypnotise some ass, shit so hot, better jump in the water, nigga
(SPLASH!)
Breakin fools at parties like a ruckus sound class
Make a philly down the back and mix the weed with more hash
I will wash away your pain like Draino
Erupting like the angriest volcano, or the wickedest whirlwind and tornado
We stay up in the streets, cruisin, me and my whole crew, gotta.......
Chorus:
Keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin'
Outro:
This one goes out
to the three brothers that I love the most, in memory of this song
My man Ratto, my man Big Joe, my nigga Love
Them niggas rest, most comfortable
Peace, L-O-N-S, forever

Now my pockets got muscles like Lou Farigno
Got the hot shit
Big up my nigga Premo
Stack loot with my nigga Dino and Enno (Julio)
Spliff and my other nigga Chico
Uno dos tres quatro cinco (Gimme five)
Count from ten all the way back to zero
Set it off rep. from here to Puerto Rico
Run in the bitches makes me black and Filipino
Trick in the hide or on the niko
Caught the round trip to Santo Domingo
My nigga Spliff criminal like Max Remo
Thug think he loud then show me your hero
Nigga tried to play me on the dealo
Tried to short me couple gram on the D-Low
Thought we didn't know better oh yeah we know
Stepping them niggas for what its gon be yo
Niggas spend money and fuck a preshow
Your name was shorty who whip in a little Geo
Dare and look niggas get left by the sea show
Lock up a nigga and sabotage the keyhole

Should've made the club crowd a little thicker
Nigga in a club fronting like a killer
You ain't eating my nigga you lookin thinner
Now you a sinner a partier beginner
You better off if dance to who got the keys to my beamer
You a killer but you never pulled a trigger
How that calculate money yo how you figure
Yo, another homerun hitter my nigga
Yo we ain't over hit you with a refiller
We keep it moving never label me a quitter
Flipmode baby you could call me flipper
She wildin we wildin along with her
My nigga put me on told me she a stripper
Fronting like he don't really wanna be with her
He told me handle my business cause he already did her
He says she used to be Lucy babysitter
Fuck a sloppy second hit the highest bidder for realla
Keep the champagne in the chiller
Keep it cold while I hit you with another wig-splitter

A lot of you niggaz don't plan on the day when you'd have to see me
You see - I'm that nigga that you should really be afraid of
I dig graves for niggaz like you
We gon' get more acquainted at a time when you least expect it
Chorus
Do you ever think (do you ever think)
What life would be (what life would be)
Where you will go (where will you go)
After you die (after you die)
You fucked up nigga!
You know that when that time comes and nobody is checkin
And everything you had is gone in the split of a second
That's when it starts hittin the fan and it gets real in this bitch
Just face the fact your shit's a wrap and you gotta deal with the shit
Despite I talk about it, I ain't makin fun of them niggaz
I give thanks cause I've been blessed and I ain't one of them niggaz
Can't imagine how difficult it is, I know you suspect
that shit around you is lookin dumb, it's gettin hard to accept it
Alone in the mirror, you look at yourself and you smile
Disregarding the fact your running's been done for a while
Refuse to acknowledge the truth like the mind of a child
Continue frontin, like it's nothin while you live in denial
While all your people around you start to leave you in the same place
You overexert the little you have left to save face
You tryin to hide your expression from lookin worried
on what to do when your career is buried
Chorus
Niggaz ain't GIVIN a fuck about your flows no more
You ain't the star you were, fuckin the same hoes no more
Promoters ain't payin and bookin you for shows no more
You ain't whippin the Range, you ain't whippin a Rolls no more
Reality starts to settle in, you're sweatin every wake up
You're broke and now you gotta return your jewelry to Jacob
You run around and you front like you're still on fire
But nobody believes you; and now you live as a liar
You're onnly lyin to yourself cause it's evident in the proof
As your world continues to crumble, come to terms with the truth
You're still holdin on to them days when everything was about you
But niggaz don't even remember you enough to just shout you
I remember when you did your thing without a doubt tastefully
The problem was you didn't know when to bow out gracefully
Once told, never burn out, it's best to fade away
Preserve your value so that you can live to see a greater day
People see you and it's bugged that you mean nothin
You doin shit and front to prove to people you mean somethin
It happens in the vicious when the truth starts to settle in
You step to the door of the club and see that you ain't gettin in
Forgettin you a man first, chasin the fame
Got to remember, morals and principles, reppin your name proper
but most niggaz don't, and they whole life hurried
What do you do when your career is buried
Chorus
Okay
I told you we was gonna get more acquainted
at a time when you least expect it nigga
I'm here to lay you to rest once and for all
You've been dead a long time but you refuse to accept that shit
But it's okay
Nigga shut the FUCK UP AND GET IN THE BOX NIGGA! (WAIT!! Please!)
It was custom built for all niggaz like you
You just don't wanna accept when it's time to hang it up
(Stop! BITCH!) See you in the afterlife nigga (Wait! HELP!!!)
WHEVER THE FUCK THAT IS!! (SOMEBODY HELP!!)
(I CAN'T BREATHE, NIGGA!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT NIGGA!)
(OPEN THIS SHIT!! )

Flick my little hazard light on
Better pull over and get on the lawn
Yo, move the barricade, and let my niggas park on the block
Make a grand entry up in the spot
You know we only here to take all of the food out the pot
It's only right cause niggas know we be taking they slack

From the streets to the alley, from the Eastern Cali and up
I'm talking dope, all of my niggas, all of my bitches
Give you something that'll split you up
And leave you with stitches
Looking pathetic, I hit y'all niggas with the kinetic
Make you respect it, and beat you in the head till you get it
Take off my jacket, hope you can match it
When the DJ go scratch up the bounce
I hope you could catch it
So what
Now let's get high, and let's get drunk
You feel that bounce, then turn it up
You light your L, and blaze it up
Get in the game, and change it up
Come in the spot, and flame it up
Let's get this dough, and live it up
Let's get this dough, and live it up
Let's get this dough, and live it up

You bouncing from the club, step on the gas
And just bounce bounce bounce, yeah
Then shorty come with you to the nearest short stay
Get up on top of that and just

If you pushing down the Belt Parkway
The Grand Central, the Long Island Expressway
The Cross Island Expressway
Southern state, Northern state, Parkway
You know 95 South, Brooklyn Expressway, you know
However way y'all traveling

You N'ah mean

Verse One: Rampage the Last Boy Scout, Busta Rhymes
I 8Off like the Assassin, now I'm blastin I'm takin over
Stick you for your blue Range Rover
I told ya, Rampage a real live soldier
Been in the game, sinc the age of thirteen
A microphone fiend, so I'm goin to see my P.O.
It's August the 1st, so I guess I'm a Leo
My P.O., look like Vanessa Del Rio
She pulled my rap sheet, just like, Neo Geo
Hahahaaa!  I always roam through the forest
Just like a brontosaurus, born in the month of May
so my sign is Taurus, kick you in your face
like my fuckin name was Chuck Norris, make you sing my chorus
Rock to the beat and then, turn into a walrus
You remain nameless, my victory remains flawless
Acting like you wild, but I know you really harmless
While your time is coming, I make the fat shit regardless
Many niggaz wanna know when the Ramp return
Yo I'm gettin phone calls from that nigga Howard Stern
He wants to know about my Flip Mode click
The way we get down and BUST NIGGAZ SHIT
LP after LP, we make G's
I run up in your ganks den take you for your keys
I'm not lying or joking, you get broken
Dead in Flatbush, back to Roanoake and...
People always askin me, how your shit be sellin
For makin shit guaranteed to bust your fuckin melon
Police throwed me up on charges like I was a felon
There was no tellin, when I was strikin had you swellin
Cruisin in my Lands, watch the police how they be gellin
Lock you up for days and got a nigga ass smellin
Yo FUCK THAT!  You best believe there ain't no time for dwellin
If you ain't makin noise you need to kill the fuckin yellin
Chorus One
Chorus Two
Verse Two: Rampage, Busta
Yo, yo, yo I run up in your set like a New York city...
I can't slip, I beat you down with my vice grip
Your lost, that means you way off course
No remorse, I'm gettin five in The Source
I be saddleback biting motherfuckers like a horse
Turn and toss, niggaz all up in my applesauce
Watch me reinforce, my shit feel good like intercourse
Ever since I was a shorty rockin Hugo Boss
Aiyyo bust it Bust (why) you just made my day
If you didn't put me on I'd be locked like O.J.
Now I'm writin rhymes hittin shorties everyday
In the full runnin drinkin ice Tanqueray
I don't eat pork I take a fish fellet
Now I'm knockin out niggaz from .. to .. touche!
Now I'm goin back around the way
I'm rippin shit, like my name was Marvin Gaye
Yo, now I'm back with more Bionic like my name was Colt Seavers
Got you niggaz open like a bunch of wide receivers
Time is on the meter, go clean your act up in the cleaners
Chickenhead, give me some of your chicken fajitas
Yo I beg your pardon, I write my rhymes way past the margins
Squeeze the Charmin, peace to one million men marchin
When you talk shit you really don't know what you startin
Now your shit is done like a fuckin empty milk carton
It's on for the nine-six, mad shows at the Ritz
Now we got you open like Fixx
Stickin to your stomach like Quaker Oat Grits
Fisherman hat with my brand new kicks
On the low, I still rock my Girbauds
See the show, I got my nickel plated fo'-fo'
All my rough niggaz open the do'
Cause Boy Scout brings the ruckus and I'm still hardco'
Yo, when I walk streets you know my blade's a little sharper
Fuck Peter Parker, I cross you like a magic marker
Everytime I hit I always hit a little harder
Blazing to the point where niggaz look a little darker
Catching suntans from my music,

Got no time to be fuckin with them wonderama niggaz
Let me loosen up your bra-strap mama nigga
LISTEN UP! Look how we be rippin up and got the party pickin up

Spit that venom; pretty thick bitches walk by
If you let 'em pussy printin through they denim
Take her for a ride 'round the block, let her enjoy the whip
Drop her off, let her walk the strip
Ain't it funny how nature work?
Make bitches wanna bounce on a nigga 'til they make it hurt, c'mon

Plus I'm not really had it with situations like these

For every girl every boy
I know they overly joyed
So fast I hear the wind whistling
Faster than a missle then

Strive to put an end to all this reckless drinving
I don't mean to bore you but

The one strategy, the one universal plan
The master blueprint, one survival for all man
I self Lord am
So divide with me and my woman co aside it's one mind
Bear witness, one respect, one culture, one way of thinking, one vision,
making the one decision, the one way of living
Common destiny amongst all
One understanding amongst me and my woman
So that we can't fall
And keep moving forward based on actual fact
Yes you'all my beautiful Mother Earth
Respect it to the max
Can't mix up or tamper with it no more
We're on the highest form of emotion, holy sacred and pure
And whats mine is yours, specially if we move in the same direction
Just for one common cause
Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live

Uh huh, uh huh, yes
So that you see?
Right
Hey you'all, you'all
I know my womans love for me
The way she cherish me
Fulfil my every appetite
With a good degree?
Or the ways to inspire or encourage me
The right amount to nourish me
Secure enough so I don't have to ask her where my loving went
When times is hopeless
Sometimes I had to focus on the priceless moments
When my wisdom by,? went by unnoticed
Cos you're my everything
And what is mine is yours
Moving in the same direction for one common cause
Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live
Just one
Come together as one

One family
As one
One little kiss now
As one
One entire tear
As one
So let us all love, live now
Ask my son right, he bears witness to you
Being the foundation you can come home and watch the babies too
The one way we agree on how to follow tradition
This one family coming first
Play your position
You make the sacrifices, I make the same too
The mother struggle
That I see, thats why my love is for you
You always hold it down for me, so I'm a hold it for you
And watch the babies while you secure the food that come through
Now don't let my ambition make you feel like competition
We should both play a role in our whole living condition
True indeed
I know you symbolise the strength inside the family
Then show me you can handle womanly responsibilities
Not a problem I know you hold me down when I fall on the ground
But make sure when you bring the food home there's enough to go round
And because you are my everything what's mine is yours
Moving in the same direction, just for one common cause
Just one
Opportunity to handle our biz
Just one
My stake so we can equally live
Just one
You know we only have one life to live
Just one
Come together as one

[forte]
Hey, what's the deal?
I seen the devil spar with allah
Mathematics was the key to set my whole race free
You might debate we, a refugee
No harm hurt me
Dying, thirsty from the struggle
To my own hustle bubble
On the low, woe is me
To show the free bob right
The righteous asiatic thinker
While satan rob light
Civilised like the molly
Burgundy, wildy rocking
Seen the fifth when ali clocked him
John forte will keep you locked in
[q-tip]
People all around
You got to recognise and witness
The mister who swift enough to knock you out with mic fitness
Hands blistered from holding the mics tight
Some say it's fright night
Well throw the r after the f 'cause I'm gonna take away your breath
The bell rings and now it's just a daily operation
Yo, you saw my lubrication
You can see this occupation (the winner)
Eh, you know we're from q-borough
L-booie and clef the trainers, prazwell promote the throw
[lauryn hill]
We used to bite bullets with the pig-skin casing
Now we perfect slang like a gang of street masons (uh)
Scribe check make connects
True pyramid architects (yeah)
Replace the last name with the x (x)
The man's got a God complex
But take the text and change the picture
Watch muhammad play the messenger like holy muslim scriptures
Take orders from only god
Only war when it's jihad
See ali appears in zaire to reconnect 400 years
But we the people dark but equal give love to such things
To the man who made the fam? remember when we were kings
Blocks on fire (block's on fire tonight)
Fiends getting higher (uh-huh)
Robbing blue collar
(hey yo we rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (stick ?em up)
Youths get tired (ali ah yeah)
We're dealing with them liars (ali ah yeah)
(we're dealing with too many liars)
From brooklyn to zaire (uh-huh ah yeah)
We need a ghetto messiah (ah yeah come on)
Send me an angel in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling
Send me muhammad in the morning, baby
Send me an angel in the morning, darling
[ali shaheed muhammad]
Once the pen hits the pad it's danger
To this I be no stranger
Step inside the ring and I'll derange you (come on)
I'm hearing no comments
Everyone looks dispondent
Dejected, rejected similiar to liston
Catching lists
Beat it, sonny
My man is still the greatest in this
To hell with frazier yappin? about that negative shit
Now listen, you can try and escape if you want to
But ask yourself, who the hell you gonna run to
Like sade abu you got a punch that I can sleep to
Fugees, tribe, busta rhymes forever coming through
[prazwell]
We sing amazing grace over two dollar plate
One roll snake eyes like jake the snake
Many lies put up for stakes
Wash our sins at the great lakes
You and I cannot see eye to eye
So therefore we cannot relate
I'm here when I make myself crystal clear
You fled to cape fear when I laced you in zaire
Tussle with a lasso in the royal rumble
Seperate boys from men in the concrete jungle
[busta rhymes]
I remember when cassius clay flipped the script
Taking trips to zimbabwe
Africans started calling the God ali bumbaye (so bwoy)
It be the God stricken, God nutrition, lightly stricken (ha)
Blow that make you feel like you was poison bitten
Ha yo I'm ?bout to blister you and your sister
Predicting every ass whipping before my fights my nigga
This be your last warning once you walk past the doorman
Ali and foreman gonna lock ass until the morning
Marvellous finances provided by joseph mobutu
Special guests of honour like the archbishop desmond tutu
We watched the rumble in the jungle
To see who be the targeted uncle to be the first to fall and fumble
Nuff blows they gettong thrown, like solid milestones
Internally shaking up niggas, imbalance your chromosones
With the force of a thousnad warriors
When I bust your ass identify me as the lord victorious
Blocks on fire (you're a star)
(blocks on fire)
Fiends getting higher (you're a star)
Robbing blue collar (you're a star)
(yeah rob them blue collars)
Killing for a dollar (you're a star)
Youths get tired (you're a star)
(youths getting tired)
We're dealing with them liars (you're a star)
(we're dealing with too many liars)
From brooklyn to zaire (you're a star)
We need a ghetto messiah

Rob them and get away in a car and crash niggas
Whats the world gonna do when I drop the smash nigga
Iron all in your face don't make me pull the trigga
Another reason for me to have to poor my own swigga
Thought I was posing for word up but a fed took my picture
Surgeon general I represent the underneath
The ask for shit beef
The worlds greatest fucking thief
Brick layer hardcore smash your front teeth
Wilding it straight giving their mother mad grief
Rob a nigga strip him down leave him in his briefs
Do so much dirt the priest asked me to turn another leaf
Made the priest flip change his whole belief
Started wildin in the club with them niggas starting beef
Act fool

And plot elaborate schemes for monies niggaz worship
Beautiful like the pleasure of when I burst my first clip
At a nigga who sold me a brick that wasn't worth shit

With my bitches who take packages under they armpit
Now, we remain the +imperial+ live niggaz
Who consistantly blackout and rep for them wild niggaz
Yo, you incompatible, snatch yo? collateral
Gun blunt you, and rep for every thug capital
Diagonal vision, niggaz seein shit on slant
Plant beatings on niggaz and celebrate a war chant
Diabolic how we manifest raw logic
Chronological time, we bring niggaz the raw project
Hold fort and represent as the grand wizard
Street chronicle illustrate the bakin of a bad blizzard
I got a spot for ya,
With live niggaz who murder sloppier
Than all of the trenchcoat mafia yo
Cause when you hear the sweet music playin
It's like theme music for murder scenes
Like the colorado slayin - cause I don't give a fuck
Speedin like we racin on the aqueduct
Black tinted-out, government truck
Curbside on niggaz, leanin just a little bit
Trunk ? ? with smoke, my bitch'll take a little hit
Fake niggaz could be the best actors
My bullets whiz so fast you feel the windshield factors
In the wrong place you get your wig peeled backwards
Get an ounce of the ?dro and steam a pack of blackwoods

As we go way beyond sky's the limit, and you know who we are
We shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars
We 'bout to do it real big like outta this world and we takin it far
Shootin for the moon and land on the starrrrrrrrrrrrrs
Let us land on the stars, let us land on the stars
Let us land on the stars, let us
Now don't you think this shit's outrageous?
At this point if you don't see I'm one of the greatest
I play the long time up in the league with the majors
In every history book they add a couple more pages
Like - about the way I take 'em through stages
On different levels, peep the way it read on the gauges
Regardless I'ma love 'em, I don't care how they hate us
No matter how they try, see they could never replace us
Like - mommy always said beware of the dangers
Embrace genuine love, be careful of strangers
Cause when you are the best they try to weaken and change us
They don't recognize at first but always do when you're famous
Like - I live my life bold and courageous
And invest my time and always calculatin my wages
And let me lead the march, they'll probably start to parade us
Because you know that I'm comin to SAVE US
Chorus
I spread my wings takin off properly
I laugh at muh'fuckers that'll think they can top me
I laugh harder cause somebody said that they dropped me
When I'm flyin through the sky now how the hell they gon' stop me
Like - most of the time it's good to be patient
Now I'm back with the crack, sorry for keepin you waitin
Prepare the food right for the street and season the steak and
grab a champagne glass and put it up, we celebratin
Like - and tell me who you tryin to race with (who?)
If you ain't notice nigga I be ridin a spaceship
I'm light years ahead and way beyond all the fake shit
I gotta stay away from trash because I probably'll break shit
Like - I know it's kinda hard to believe this (why?)
The way I always come back and return with the heat bitch
This shit ain't a secret, son it's hard to defeat this
Risin out the ashes, flyin like a PHOENIX
Chorus
See now you see I'm back in the zone, B
And it feels good to be home with Sylvia Rhone see
Back to smash on the planet, niggaz know I'm the only
one to be back with the authentic to smash all the phonies
Like - we mostly do the thing that you can't teach
And then send 'em a rhyme into that bullshit you can't reach
Then I give you shit that make the hood wanna bang in the street
And state my word is bond, I live out what I SPEAK nigga!

As I say it over and over again
From song to song, yeah, so remarkable
Hah, heh, yeah, so remarkable
[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, Busta Rhymes the immaculate raw
Hardcore, riggady raw, lay niggas flat on the floor
We climb into the back of the four
Nonchalant flavor fo' sure, Timbs wit a aqua valor
Flava like you never seen it before
Ha, holy, sacred, and pure
Flipmode, be on it fo' sure
Be incredible to settle the score
Like a nigga shot you in the face, through the peephole in the door
From New York, down to Singapore
Keep you niggas jumpin' around, had the bitches beggin fo' more
Street niggas, yeah we speak for the poor
Now we stack cheddar galore, when we shop and buy at the store
Metaphor like nuclear war
I warned niggas if you try to bite, shit I'll leave a crack in your jaw
Take the livest niggas out on a tour
Make a nigga black in the spot, make you wanna take off a door
[CHORUS:]
All my dogs who hustle everyday
All my dogs who hustle everyday now
Own a store laundrymat around the way
And own a store laundrymat around the way now
We got to get it, YEAH!

Now, yo, we stay packin the toast
Could give a fuck, bust at a ghost
And end up on the front of the post
Niggas know that I be rockin the most
Fuckin Ethiopian bitches, living in the ivory coast
Let me drug y'all niggas up wit a dose
Make you act just like you suppose'
Watch a nigga playin me close
Nowadays type of dough that we gross
I celebrate and throw me a roast
And get an old face for a host
We get it hype even when we be calm
Niggas know my word is my bond
When we come you know we the bomb
Hypnotic shit, get you retarded
Shoulda known it was a bad move
Fuckin around and gettin me started
Still whippin in the back of the truck
So what, not givin a fuck
In the streets, livin it up
So what happened to the last nigga bust
Could give a fuck whoever he was
Throw them niggas outta the clubs
Them niggas all, shit turnin me off
Tie 'em up, makin 'em cough
Gag 'em in the throat wit a cloff
After that we go and wild for the night
Make 'em know the style for the night
Car low, pile for the night
You know we always give y'all niggas a blaze
Black it out and party for days
Let y'all niggas fuck with the strays
Fuckin dimes at the end of the days
Gettin money but it's too late
Got a nigga stuck in his ways

Remember the days when I was walking and talking
Doing what I gotta do, doing what we wanna do
Off into my walked dawn missions, why?
Cos the brothers that I knew with the rise drove by
Only nice in the days looking down the road
Seeing beatiful girls with the car load
Yeah yeah yeah they are screaming,
Wish I had a little ride on my own,
But since I don't there is my sobb story
My missions will continue as I keep on stalking
Stamina was dying from the constant walking
Right before the moment I began to car to my man ridle
Who had a some moving on
I tought he wouldn't know that's my dying
Where are the others nammy you beat and kept driven
Now in my heart they do a big hole
Cos my little, little, little toes
Started jumping on my end soul
It was frigity burn and then I said wait, I got pride
It's time to get my own ride
I came up with the scheme and got paid
I had no other choice but go at knowledge of tray
When I got my transport, I got kind of steam g up
Cos I got cherry pet further
Now I'm feeling good cos I'm off my feet,
Man the little squalid dogs running up in the street
And they saying:
My name is sharina, my name is busta
My name is tonia, my name is busta
My name is dianna, my is busta
And what do you take me for the little loco push over
No shame in my game cos that's how I got this
And when I return the playback everybody gets pist
And now I am the man fielding all the glory
And when you rise down and gone, just remember that

I know you and you know me,
I know you and you know me,
I know you and you know me,
It's the sobb story, the sobb story

Figure out vehicle-brother, to give me a ride

Smoke from the rubber word up to my neck
Girls wear goochie and their friends way fendy
Wall ally a walker to get fairly
Just a beep beep an ocasional way

Lunchtime marty and deon
Jonhy guills, diego stroy, and dacon
Sitting and waiting for about to biggy these
I stack by the crackerjacks just through delieve
Stress it's a mess I decided to work
But it's hard to work when your boss is a jerk

Didn't have a job and his car was a mob more brothers

Chukie was a lucky so here's your end friend
I sets the show ain't brocoli and rice
The newer to the new not the old spice
Mind over matter it's got a true-school-blue
Betty cracker made it better
Poindex the flex to track by busta
With a little bit of sore from the crackerjack store
Still at will
For field up the skill for the jill by the jack
Misguided mojo swing low string
Sing along as I bring along with the song
Sedated by the maid, meenie mi mo
Yo, gotta go, gotta gotta go so!

To the brain sha-now here there's no shame
In my game let me be your remedy man

Verse 4: rumpletilkinz

But now I got elevel with the flow
I riding from the bottom go straight to the top
When I'm only in graping on the hip hop pop
I'm crossing the line heading for the border
Feel a quite thirsty, need a cup of water
Toilet in grandplans they like sub treplets
90's are the year of the rumpeltilskinz
Take it all witches in throw'em in ditches
If you front to this you just kit stitches
Down with the rumpeltil and I love the redskinz
Should I begin trancept by friends

On the dance floor I willing and able to freak

Verse 8: cut-monitor milo

Don't eat bacon cos that's for saking

No need to play hot cos I can't be frozen

Focus your dice, when the vulture's in flight

yo' faggot peoples ain't even checkin
Yo y'all need to send the coroner, shit
Leave you lookin out a place
like youse a tourist on some foreigner shit
I be that nigga and I love to experiment
with specific high-explosives
just to take y'all niggaz out of this element, NOW!!
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Cause we got new shit for y'all
(All my niggaz in the spots,
y'all know we tear the shit down and how we hold it nigga)
And we come to take shit over y'all
(Yes we here to regulate
and put our foot down, the shop is closin nigga)
Always rep the street for all y'all
(Constantly hittin y'all off with street shit
and keep y'all niggaz open yeah
All my niggaz, all my bitches) Whatcha'all gon' do now,
everytime we come with that street shit
[Busta Rhymes]
Hah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, we move like stonefaced cold-hearted niggaz
Baldfaced straight retarded niggaz
Aiyyo the shit we do be so off the hook,
fuck around and get yo' leg broke
and beat all in yo' face with ya foot
We here to stay, FUCK payin a visit
I only fuck with certain LIVE niggaz
like my niggaz Tash and Xzibit
Ever since I vowed to keep the shit raw
I stay hittin niggaz with shit
that'll leave they fuckin face on the floor
Everytime niggaz know when we black
Smack a nigga so fuckin hard
he'll fall and probably spin on his back
Funny how niggaz'll always shit talk
The very next day they will notice the difference
in the way they bitch walk
My street niggaz need to come for the ride
Cause when we step up in the place
you funny niggaz need to slide to the side
I love to watch these funny niggaz diminish
and while we slowly murder them niggaz
they prayin on the MOMENT we finish
I take you back to the very beginnin
and beat you in yo' head from birth
and watch you grow lovin the SHIT we be bringin
Street niggaz keep they mind on they dream
Focus the most on gettin they paper
and be thoroughly reppin they team
You know we quick to mash it down for some hours
Quick to leave some of these niggaz shook
runnin with the rest of them cowards
And leave the rest of niggaz ready to dumb
and rep the street until we all die
could give a fuck wherever you from, NOW!!
[Chorus w/ minor variations]
[Busta Rhymes]
For all my motherfuckers
that live in the urban city areas
Only the urban city areas
The ghettoes
The neighborhoods where they got, delis, liquor stores
and churches right across the streets from alla that
Yeah..
Motherfuckers sellin weed, crack, and all of that shit
on the corner - it ain't the right thing to do
But niggaz is put in the motherfuckin, living conditions
that have to do that shit
The street motherfuckers
All y'all survival of the fittest motherfuckers, SURVIVE
This is dedicated to y'all
Street shit

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Roll out the red carpet baby the god has come
No matter who you are or where you from
Check it I stay be repin the street and reppin the slum
And while you co-starrin' this movie I star is the one, listen
You never imagined that I would become one of the most incredible
Until when ever I'm done
Notice the god like meet you from when I was young
Blessed with such a maculess flow and a venomous tongue
How we keep you holla until you collapse on the lung
With the biggest followin' the nigga slackin a nun
Able to move a mountain of niggaz havin then sprung
Just check out my women but how be havin then strung ass though
Like how the coke be havin them numb
Run up in the spot like I was holdin and clappin' the gun
Now I'm lose for y'all I'm bringin the proof to y'all
Ballin and speckin the truth to y'all
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
The chorus is singin' the words that I fill in my gut
That's why I always step with a bop and walk with a strut
And I always rep for the block and we all for the bucks
And we always step in the spot and be all for the cut
Vallet block two parkin' spots all for the turck
Bounce to the world when I be tired and be gone for the month
And it's all for the slut flowin' like a force of the water
Keepin' it runin so were the niggaz be at
Well they seein me commin'
Summers people keep it clapin' women just give me they lovin'
They way the streets be fillin' the kid they really be buggin'
Like I'm there dearly beloved my soldiers really be thuggin
Or how I really be slugging' the ball out the ball park
Keep them whilin' then ten minutes later then it's sawed off
Create a small spark then down to the levels to make the walls stark
Testin' the God I think he be needin' them all off
[Chorus]
[Bridge: Busta Rhymes]
Listen
I keeps the hustle up in my vain
Cause it's all in my blood
Fell my pain
Fell my love
Fellin' niggaz struggle till the other one
[Chorus - repeat 3X]
Getin' to struttin' like the G.O.D.
Listen
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I'm sayin' we comin' through when I'm blockin' the light
Niggas think they rockin' the crowd but ain't rockin' it right
Make the people shout to the sound and rock for the night
Cause I stay in the struggle ready rock for the fight
I stay whipin' the truck and leanin' and rock what I like
And quadruple my money more than the block of the white
We sayin' we bout ?? stopin' your rooms
How I be rockin' the diamonds like I'm dropin them jewels

Zoom zoom zoom zoom ZOOM as my blood starts to raise through
My vains all I wanna is to be close to you
I like you in those boots, you know just what to do

I want to taste your breast taste below your waste
That's some of my many wishes
Fresh out the bubble bath girl you taste so delicious
From when you leave and go to work and how you blow me kisses
The way you come back to the crib and cook and wash the dishes
It's kinda hard to fight it once the fire is ignited
You feel my heart beat baby you got me so excited
I can't explain the feelin
It's such an amazing thing
You like a prize position
A gift to any king or wings
Is only here to protect us
No matter what we go through
And how it might affect us
Tired of the lectures
A piece to tell me to chill
But they don't really understand what im tryin to build
But I brush it off as nothing
Baby let me tell you something
Every single time I see you my adrenalin be rushin
Your body is smoking like a Newport
Better yet im backwards
You like it in the back seat case baby girl your that hood
I never had it how you put it on me
The way you move is makin me horny
Man I just wanna kiss you all over you body stretch you like palates
Baby lets get naughty do it how we do fuckin all around the house
Started on the bed ended up on the couch
Damm I touch you and you touch me
We get closer and you hold me like your holdin
On for dear life boldly
And we go out on the balcony
And let our bodies wrap up and we fuck
Until the sun come up housekeepin come and catch us
I don't care thou u takin it im givin it we breakin it
Everything up in the room like a tornado in the makin
And im wildin and im racing baby let me take you down
And while you give it to me let me give it back girl listen to the sound as it goes

Come alive from the bottom to the top.
Temptation or confusion makes you wanna stop.

Wack stage shows, wack page flows.
Biters non-rythm writers. (example the sample).
It was an age under and a stage back.
The girlie's screaming she's having a cardiac.
Like epileptic seizures no
Amnesia comatose double dose anaesthesia.
Damn. (damn) should I say.
What are you doing! , I dare at your stare so yo
Come do me, it's done or rather should I say it's on.
The mental instrumental I continue with.
My song yeah we've got jumping jerks with no understandings of
The east coast stomp. fam understand.
Several other brothers watch our videos the vidiots discover.
Verse 2:
(it's just another case) wow! (base).
Why is everybody always picking on me.
Now let's see our games played.

You cheated gold, only sold to who

When I timberland and down listen wait.
Who's that coming around sounding like that sound.
I guess it's dinco, milo, busta, and bro! wn.
Four minds of two kinds run one with the sun.
I love my father, mother, my brother, and the sisters
That come from all over the place to trace the base.
Inspector clouseau I wonder is true though.
Oh no, no more security.
Nets straight human casualties
Call for raw regrets in beat societies.
Lessons must speak,
Stand be strong. keep away from weak in the years long.
Life leaders let loose leading leftbacks.
And misguided youth letting leaks lack.
Levels of truth. look ma? no hands.
Lend likes lots of love only lasting cause I'm asking.
Could we be above average not savage,
But near newly more duty, more than terror.

Hay watch out for the trickery.
What happened to creativity, dignity, integrity.
Hey mr. sneaky-one don't try to read my mind.
Just worry about getting yours, because I'm getting mines.
Leaders made a commitment to keep this type of music.
Livin? forever.
Whatever, whatever.
We live in an era where errors aren't made to
Remain an error, but I think that's kinda better.

Don't ring the bell I'm not comin to CLASS
Teachers bein preachers how the hell can I PASS?
First day of school and would zone to the rear
with a blind spot view and a one leg chair
I asked when WHAT when WHAT when class ends
The teacher points at the door: ""Go be with your friends!""
YUP!  My rep was in effect to keep in step
So I stopped to drop bombs for a check
Cause all I learned was when where why what and who
And then I asked ""Do you think this is true?""
OUT! like a strike that's three and a number

Further and further away, doin it out of sight

""What about life?  The real (THE REAL)
uncut uncensored deal (DEAL)""
I must not go AHH in class
I won't pass, at last for the blast
Stop the brainwash, hang out to dry
Nonsense I'm convinced it's lies
Truth to the youth is necessary
Important?  Damn!  I'd say very
March!  HUT ONE HUT TWO!
C'mon, March!  HUT THREE HUT FOUR!
I'd say just educate yourself
Don't depend on your school for help
Read and write, cause it's, evidence
Cause teachers, yo, they be teachin us NONSENSE
Now last but not least it's a Busta Rhymes
(Yeah I know which one you're talking about)
He's always talking to the girls, talking in class
starting trouble, throwin spitballs
(Yeah he's a hardcore problem, uhh... detention!)
[Busta Rhymes]
YO!! Wake up in the morning to a big fat WOW!
Gotta get to school, on time anyHOW!
In school, the brainwash epidemic
Gotta hit em back with a rhyme calisthetic
Got enough beef with the kids who be switchin
Now I'm in school, and yo the teacher starts riffin
this and that, and yo it's all irrelevant
As I get older gotta build my own intelligence
TEACHER, what are you doin
Is it my rhymes that you're really tryin to ruin
Back of the class then I come FORTH
The water lies between us, it's time to CROSS
Me being the younger, him the elder
If we were in a war, he thinks I surrender
Kids on the block just scramblin AHHH
Cause the teacher's in class just babblin OOOH
They're teachin nonsense, teachin total nonsense
Then they wonder why we so disobedience
HUH, he tried to break my back
HUH, I come, like black on the attack
Young and the Restless, teacher don't test this
If you try to front, you'll be sure to get this
POW BOOM BANG, straight to the grill
Teach the truth yo, relax and chill
Pronunciation, vexed I'm pissed
Yo my man you better stop teachin us that nonsense
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH
There it go like that!
Alright Mr. Mangini, aahh, what do you suggest that we do
about Busta Rhymes, Charlie Brown, and Dinco D?
(Those three problems?  They're never gonna amount to anything anyway
Throw em all out, expel em)
HELL NO!  WE WON'T GO! *repeat and fade*

It was the best heist since ice
Precise rituals
Skated outta Jacob's wit the Fruit Loop jewels
Holdin a navy blue uzi
Krush Groovin waves off the atlas
Coolin, that's how we make movies
Basketball gun brawlers, bounce
Black down 'bill-a-head banks, Malibu colorful shanks
That's the way we live, Staten Island kid
Old dog in it, the thug vaccine wit no pork in it
Vivid imagination paper chasin
Dufflebag swollen, we holdin
Drink chocolate milk before we roll in
It's like that ya'll, we gangstas
Stickin all you Bay Ridge Benzes
I'm out to get erect, terrific shit be the diamond district
Tiffany's, pretty Valentine brick is on the second floor balcony
Gems is magnificent, diamonds is cryin
""Busta Rhymes take me, nevermind help!""
[Raekwon]
Aiyyo caught em at the ice pavilion
Dressy, salad bar style Nestle
Four white niggas, covered in vest pieces
Think like a mob flick
Guessin like Patsy in the mask, piece bust
Got aggravated, slapped the glass piece
One nigga beamin, faggot ass
Lay on the floor ya fuck!
Tied his broken arm to his Hush Puppies
Wrapped around trauma, everything realer than fuck
Tajuana left my nigga niece live comma
Three young Italians, suited down personal style
I'm in valour white designin on the 'dallions
Felt like some crackers was in back of me
Spit on the clerk, pass the Harry Winston set
Ghost backin me
Bust a shot, motored
Four male in paper work Lord
We get together once more before we blow this
Murdered nobody
Left em all baseball'd down, brotha
Three wicked ass 6's, Gucci colors
[Busta Rhymes]
MONEY! Drop dead on the floor
Nigga, pass the keys to the door
Pass me all the cash in the drawer

Whippin the Acuras, feel like a mac bustin
A rug in Preston on percussion
I'll bust in your gate, nigga it's nothin
A hail storm, ice rainin, mind containin
Info, nigga what you in for? Complainin
Sick bars deep in this language
Did I tell you how my day's spent?
Speakin through the face of Ronald Regan
Iceberg History, calligraphy
Colidescope colors, hollow-head shells and flarin gunmen
Hate to see me comin like gray skies on day of judgment
Makes you wonder where the love went
Hit a nigga, feed him to some buzzards
Put up numbers, plus I'm one to push his mug in
We duck in the safe, check what I'm huggin
Rocks the size of some shit, out in the congo
My arms full, let's get the fuck out, Busta I got you
[Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo we do great study on fossils and stones like archeologists
Gem-ologists, collect the most priceless ices anonymous
Canary stones yellow like a pumpkin
Dunkin Donut precious size stones make me wanna cut the safe open
Rae pass the blowtorch, Ghost brought the dynamite stick
Marciano brought a chisel wit an ice pick
Princess cuts, invisible settings
Plannin the world's greatest diamond heist playin a tune by Otis Redding
Icicle cones hang from the ceiling just like stalagmites
Time to throw on a skully and tying a rag tight
Throwin light went off and in the basket
Grabbed the necklace from off the satin pillow while the glass casket
Ice lay across the crushed burgandy velvet
Up in the diamond slide-tray
Gun in your face, slide it right away
Roundtable with Habib, Mirishnokof, and the rest of them Jewish niggas
We got them niggas drunk and talkin foolish see
You know the way we straight manipulated the shit
We swindle them niggas for all their precious things before we skated and shit
Yeah, ya'll niggas know we skated early
Disguised ourselves as the cidic Jews and even left my sideburns curly
Bounce to Mexico and spend some pesos
And bury the diamonds on an island your never heard
Like Turks in Keikos
Everytime we hit, we in and out quick
Don't be surprised if we behind supplyin niggas all the platinum and shit
[MONEY! 17x]
Yeah, the world's greatest jewel heist
Thoroughly and successfully executed
By none other than Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef
Rock Marciano and Busta Rhymes

Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
It's a sunny day and the sky is bright
Take her to the mist everything is right
No need to make bets cause I met a bookie
Today is the day the whole school plays hookie
Why? cause I called dinco d and brown
Cutmonitor milo brings the sound
Before I do that I play myself like a jerk
Make sure momma jamma took her body to work
Okay she is gone so I jet to the phone
Let the whole world know nobody's home
It's busta rhymes and I'm feeling irie
Come on over cause I'm having a party
Milo did the right thing and brought the ride
The sound's too pissed now the party's live
Tickets in effect, everything's sweet
As I zoned in my bus, all I had to say is ""that beat""
That beat, just keep the same old beat
Check it out y'all, come on, come on
Just keep the same old beat
[dinco d]
On the fourth day of school, hookie wasn't here
Today's the first day of a brand new year
There's girls that's rubbing butts around the room
Fellas feeling good cause the gates is boom
Zoom to the doom of a sugarplum toon
Me, busta, and brown is gonna rock the mic soon
With a huh! here we go in june
Power cat with the snap in the rules
Throw a misses out, this is all street news
You choose, don't lose a views
Prices move in like cruise a bruise
Stacked on a four pack stack of freaks
I guess I'll play hookie for a couple of weeks
[charlie brown]
Six a.m. and I hear my alarm
Rushed to the phone, I called vietnam
He's asleep so I leave a message
At the tone, you know time is of essence
Quickly I jumped straight into the shower
The baby powder, cause I can't smell sour
Get dressed, put on my nike airs
Come my hairs, go upstairs
Walk outside to the fruit stand
And dre, kane, he's the 40's in hand
Powercat geronimo is in the distance
The fifths are coming, the fifths are coming
Hit up, lit up the blunt and I'm straight
Quarter to eight and my day looks great
Walked to the school with about 40 feet
That means the squad is 20 deep
I zoned
Zone coaster (the international...) (repeat 6x)
[busta rhymes]
Finally by now the whole crew's in the house
Brown just came and he's roaming about
Music just started, yo where is milo?
Got a chicken in the room and he's trying to hide, yo
Next is my man (who? ) gary gennew
Half of the mob and a case of brew
Rumpletilz with the diggum smacks
A get through the door with the cracker jacks
Classic from medina cold looking very hard
Next to the door came the yardman scard
Into my crib to find the inchie at last
Kallie any crew with my boy shabazz
Shake it time iller to settle the score
Then powercat through the locks on the door
Bugging at the jam like I'm cyclone
Now an hour to seven come to find out that I'm zoning
Huh, check it out, yeah
[dinco d]
No school? cool
I'll just fool around off school grounds
Too many kids doing bids in detention
I'm just chilling, what is this they mention?
L.o.n.s. to the set, look he has a gun
?91 is fun, lots of baked buns
Prepare the wine to a reggae cut
Not (not) not (not) who (what) what?
Mom, a bomb, sound the alarm
Leave the dance before she causes some harm
I go out the backdoor with a hard bone
Look at the clock and then I start to zone
[charlie brown]
Got to the hive, no one was there
Truant officers began to stare
Called dinco d but he's not home
Drop another quarter into the phone
Call busta rhymes, what's up my man?
(having a party, understand? )
Where's dinco d, you know, the d?
(here's the phone) (sup c.b.? )
I'm coming (hurry up, hurry up!)
Milo started throwing on all the cuts
Walking to the crib and I heard ""hello""
Turned, it was epitome and shemello
Told them the scoop and I kept stepping
Almost had to stop and I started sweating
Rob pulls up, he says ""come on get in""
Place was packed with stupid skins
Got to busta's crib and grabbed a 40
Cracker jack's habit, naughty naughty
Grabbed the gold tone microphone
Woke up saturday, I zoned

[Busta in background] happy Thanksgiving
with the crack and the guns, death and disease they called for you and your

The struggle will be lost
If you continue to do the shit you be doin' with disloyalty nigga
Now that explains why in each ward you avoiding me nigga
Knowing now it takes nothing to be destroying a nigga
Conditioned with a mind to shit on your brother
Flossing with jewelry and whips just like a dick and still live with your mother
Copping shit that superceded your salary
Where is your loyalty to your own blood and taking care of your family
Funny how you sit and drink what you drink
Thinking the foulest shit and not even knowing why you think how you think
Must be the reason why we aren't aware
Because the devil know how guilty and filthy he is in all his affairs
Fucking with my mind when I was a youngster
Cause he know if we knew the truth we'd make his ass run from amongst us
That's why we thinking that it's better to ball
while the devil be sitting and watching plotting how to murder us all
now this

Hey yo
That's why I'm hustling harder
Now I'm in a huddle seeing the struggle in my mother and father
That's why my persona will come with such a karma to be getting this paper
Cause I ain't with the slavery labor
A lot of niggas in the hood probly relate to me greater
than those that believe when they die they going to meet the creator that's crazy
how we become slaves
to mental death and power that comes with becoming even more of a dumber ass
the devil robbing you blind
concealing the truth from niggas while we be struggling they murder the mind
the wickedness sneak on you quicker when they creep from behind
continue to speak the truth ?til it weaken your spine
now check it
the jewel I give you be the beat the beat for the time
you can't see it like you living on a street for the blind
young whitty hustler niggas that stick with the grind
fly cuisine food poisoned cause you eatin' the swine
I stay struggling and doin' for delf
Then I dig in my body deeper and do a little knowledge of self
They wonder why they catch a nigga on the weed sell
Better be careful what you saying on them e-mails
Now listen
They got your mind in a prison
You can do whatever you want but focus if you desire to listen
As I say it I hope you feelin' the wrath
Create a hammer to make a man that a beat you in the head with the math

And you know that we got this
[Busta]
(Hugh) Brand new, all the way down the line
From the new bounce the new money down to the newest shine
Wit the new blue nine though I had to bust it a few times
Watch these funny niggas and analyze all the true signs
In due time we will accumulate, illuminate
My click will fuck up the money you allowin your crew to make
Yeah, and while we step up in the hot spot
And fuck with these bitches until somebody start to bust shots
Niggas duck for a second make sure they ain't the ones got
To start the party against me (Ho) and yell blood clot!
Everything be goin on from chicks blowin kisses
Straight wildin out while these niggas surround these freak bitches
Once somebody else started bustin they heat vicious
I started holdin my toast, defendin all my street riches
Up in the club champagne up in the ice bucket
Now these niggas is wildin and throwin they drinks (Fuck it!)
[Chorus]
[Mary]
Now don't get mad, cause what you had
Too bad it didn't last
And now we're back on this Busta track
And now the games on smash
[Busta]
Yeah, all my live niggas get yours
Floss heavy, all my bitches bounce on the floor
Check it, squads deep with niggas everybody on
Make the livest motherfuckers wanna bounce to my song
Check it, my niggas organize, analyze the teamwork
And how a bad shorty rockin that Rah Digga T-shirt
And keep it goin while you tag along, swing along
And see my niggas that be reppin while you sing along
[Chorus - repeat 2X]

I'm just playin wit y'all niggaz, I'm just playin wit y'all niggaz!
They told me to!
Chorus
They see my name and lifestyle and say I changed (how I be so raaawww)
They so cold... I know... that they're out to get me
And alllll those people I call my friends, let it gooooooooo
That's why I never call on y'all, to be around
'Cause you see how this monnneeeyyy can change your friends' faaaiiittthhh
Geah! See I done came a long way and now I got me a chauffeur
Keep my enemies close, keep my friends even closer
Muhfuckers that I grew around, thought I could rock wit 'em
Watch my cake so hard, they burn a hole in my pocket
I see 'em coming from afar because I been through so much shit
They plot a lot, hard or not, they see my dough come quick
Invested in my niggaz, took the realtor route
Gambled on the wrong niggaz, had to filter 'em out
Type of dudes that see my mother and they greet her respectful
behind her back and see her son and try to give me a quick full
It's cool though, I fucks wit 'em even though I ain't wit it
That's why the gats be in the house whenever niggaz come visit
Serve 'em drinks and welcome all to the law
For let ya drunk friend to show his true side until ya forced to cut him off
I seen it one too many times, they disbelieved and they speechless
Sometimes having certain friends can end up being a weakness
See now my dogs turn to wolves and try to front me and surround me
Come up out they sheepskin and act all different around me
Chorus
Listen! Sometimes I smoke a cigarette and then I think and I choke on
how niggaz steal this funny style and I was struggling broke
Even though it don't surprise me, shit it's still kinda funny
When I ain't have, a nigga still would come and try to take from me
Instead of cutting my losses, being smart and just end shit
Niggaz was trying to be loyal, just to maintain a friendship
In the wrong situation, plus there's always a sequel
I'm with the wrong muhfuckers, plus they 'pose to be people's
As I get more money, days get colder
I learned to realize that power only lies in the hands of the beholder
So then I start the heart-on-my-heart as I walk like a soldier
Moving so militant, you think I had a chip on my shoulder
Living by morals and principles mainly
Having heavy thoughts to a kill a brother every time a fucker betrayed me
But now I'm winning with the strength of the nation
I promise that they not even foreseeing the size of the shit they'll be facing
I'm Aftermath now, shit's getting worse
Now when those same ""friends"" see me goin hard that shit be making 'em hurt
Chorus
Instead they getting together with me so we both can get rich
When I'm outta town, these niggaz busy tryna fuck with my bitch
Same niggaz spend they money 'til the shit'll diminish
I hit 'em off and turn around and come right back when it finish
I said I'm tired of these niggaz, that'll owe me so much shit
that they can't pay me back for, fuck all the dumb shit
Sometime we can't forgive whatever balances off
'Specially when niggaz cross the line that niggaz never should cross
Realized and thus I state the same shit, get the Range
The more money niggaz get, shit around you will change
Even though niggaz'll flip and say, ""He the one changed""
Fuck you, the dude'll just'll justify.. takin his shit from you
The more money I get, I get more dangerous stupid
'Cause I been broke before, and I refuse to go back to it
And while I sweep these niggaz up under the rug with a broom
If I never see these ""friends"" again, that shit'll be too soon
Shit is real like every wind in my breath
And that's on everything I love, BLOOD OF MY BLOOD! FLESH OF MY FLESH!
Chorus

Yo, it's 3:25 in the morning
My baby mom still yawning
Kiss my little daughter on the forehead
'Nuf said, beeper goes off
Five hundred, it's Busta Bust
In God We Trust another one bites the dust
[Busta]:
Hey Ramp, fuck that!
I was 'bout to see this cat
Some niggas pulled up in a black suburban jumped out the back
Tried to put it on me while we fighting over the gat
The way them niggas tried to play me son, them niggas is wack
Aeiyo, Ramp, yo, you know it's only right to react
Call the whole squad, let's lay these niggas down - face flat
Aeiyo, Bust, chill, calm down
I'll be there in twenty minutes
Uptown 1-51 at St. Nick
I'm there quick
I tell my baby mom I got's to go
I walked out the do' then grabbed the two nines out the flo'
Driving through South, yo, we takin' niggas war
Still on the run
Always running for cover when its necessary
I'm out numbered for now
But all that shit is temporary
Fuck with the wrong clik, the way we get down
If your violatin', leavin you lost, you never be found
Number whatever on missing persons
Any minute them niggas gon' feel blast of my squads gats bursting
I through the tri-borough bridge
In my fat land with my two nines and my mans
I'ma second from the spot
I cross the street from the parking lot
My trigger finger is hot
I'm seeing Bust in a phone booth
Niggas on the roofs
Spiff Star is in the range
The atmosphere change
Lord's in the forerunner with machine guns, big ones
Now we 'bout to have mad fun
Me and the  whole squad meet up,
Know shit about to heat up
Went the whole entire street up
Blast from the car seat-er
My enemies wouldn't even wanna be you
I see you, hunting me down
I knowing that my crew arrive
We gon' see who be the last alive
While we creep all over the place
Looking for space
In case, see him, rinse my whole clip up in his face
As my squad hold they post down
We patiently waiting for them to pass through
Carefully timing the way we put it on their whole crew
Aeiyo, Bust give me the queue
I'm here for you, close to you
Blood in and blood out
We goin' all out, bullets just ringing out
Guns is just spraying out
Yo Bust, hit the dirt layflat
You my nigga to the end I gotcha back
Turn around quick
Oh shit!
You started blasting, grazed me on the hip
Lord Have Mercy dumped five on a nigga
Suck his whole shit, his whole crew busting
Shit ain't going according to plan
Goddamn, my shit jam
Nigga standing right behind me
I think I'm caught up on a creep
I think I need to prayer to Lord, my soul to keep
Dis nigga about to fry my head
My crew burst into a rage
Spliff lifted this nigga, putting two inside his rib cage
Yo, Rampage
Aeiyo, I see them niggas coming, now I'm dumbing
We dead three niggas already the next two we leaving bloody
So much drama over this fucking money
The way this situation end it wasn't even funny
Trying to rob this nigga because I was fucking hungry
But if you try to test let's blast a nigga in a hurry
Me and my squad bounce and left the fucking scene ugly
[Anthony Hamilton   The Chosen Generation]:
Things we be doin' for money
Livin' in the street when you're hungry
The way you start to live it ain't funny, no, no
Living day to day but don't live for tomorrow

[Busta Rhymes]
Just make sure them, them drums is smackin
..
This, means, WAR!!
I work hard to take care of every one of my niggaz
Feel the love and appreciation from all of my niggaz
When I think meditate and contemplate for my soul
watch the truth manifest once the story unfold
Disloyal motherfuckers I'ma BANISH you all
and celebrate all in your absence once I get rid of y'all
Sometimes I can't describe the wicked shit I feel in my heart
Break my silence and sporadically tear you apart
Strike with a serious vengeance and before you die
Put you through the worst and make you take a look in my eye!
So you could witness the extreme damage caused by betrayal
Make you sorry for the fact that you attempted and failed!
Make you eternally suffer, you was one of my mens
Turn your back on me, and I'ma make sure you get it back times ten
Stay TRUE -- now that's the one thing I religiously pledge
If you ain't wit me I'ma throw you WAY over the edge
THIS MEANS WAR!!
[Ozzy Osbourne]
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
[Busta Rhymes]
As I cherish every blessing and I greet you with hugs
You my peoples when I see you I embrace you with love
Yeah I be the one to come and get you out of the hole
Yeah you be the one to run and leave me out in the cold
So amazing how many times you plot and you scheme
But what you don't realize, you'll never conquer my dream
Though devilish karma can't penetrate the steel in my armor
Time passed, my oppression got you living with drama!
Paranoid of my retaliation, living in fear
Disloyalty will have me kill my brother, sheddin a tear
Such a shame how you could easily get trapped in a zone
And have to go to war with FAKE niggaz standin alone
Until I get with all my loyal niggaz goin the length
Don't matter how hard you try you never weaken my strength!
Now I'm with all of my loyal niggaz, breakin the bread
And if you diss the code of honor we takin your head;
THIS MEANS WAR!!
[Ozzy Osbourne]
Take a look inside
You can run and you can hide
If you cross my path
I'll make sure you feel my wrath
Give and you receive
Cherish every breath you breathe
Scriptures on the wall
Those who betray all must fall
Nobody helps them
Now he has his revenge
[Busta Rhymes]
Whatchu gon' do?  Whatchu gonna do?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!
Where you think you can run, or you can hide?!!!!
I'ma BE the best to show love let's co-operate
Disloyalty is somethin that we won't tolerate
Deal with these niggaz, let's put them where they properly go
On the Island far away in a place where NOBODY know
So long fightin the bullshit for so many years
Watchin the danger and niggaz double crossin they peers
Yes I always fight for what is right and put my foot down
Disrespect my love, I'ma be LAYIN YOU DOWN
THIS MEANS WAR!

And all adults die, leave the toddlers cryin'
I've been a soldier, never met private ryan
Hey welcome to the jungle, and I'm the lion
I'm dippin' in my coupe, with the top behind me
I'm not the president, but I see cops behind me
Well f**k 'em, f**k 'em, f**k 'em, and they can not stop me

Have you lookin' like a human torch
Then have you lookin' like Freddy Krueger
So don't be sleepin' on me, this aint a f**kin' dream
I pass the rock to these jays like I'm on they f**kin' team
But I aint slangin' dope, I slang Luda-vision
Hip-Hop's God in these jeans, now that's true religion
You couldn't fill my shoes, You couldn't fill my jockey
My niggas fight over ice like we been playin' hockey
I hope you get the goal, I hope you get the point
I'm on a roll with this paper, I hope you get the joint
I hope you fire it up, I hope it burn slow
I welcome chicks to my nest, I let these birds know
And eagles fly alone, so I'm about to take flight
And throw it up like ya girl's dress on prom night

Now that I'm pissy drunk, why the hell you wanna thug and holla
I'll change that and have you consider studyin' Kabbalah (Shit)

It was the first shine on the day of my birth I enterd the earth blind,
Funerabole to everything I would first find,
condition of beating nigga's having the wurst mind,
becoming weak like we scavangers of the wurst kind,
from having nothing to plot and makin the earth mine, making the earth mine,
thats kinda big aspirations for a nigga thats just kinda got on his first grind,
but it's aight cause im blowing hold on my first shine,
kinda gas quiker than spas ready to burst mine,
and thoug it seems like obstuckles come at the wurst time,
going from being succesful to commiting the wurst crime,
so quike like a bitch massaging ya whole dick and bustin up,
and it's over sabotagin ya own shit,
we always good when we get it and then abuse and regret it,
cause it's quike as we get it we fucking lose it,
that's what my mother used to tell me.

you got it good baby just get your shit together,
before you lose it and it's over and gone forever,
dressed for the stormy weather feel the songs,
for everyone is personal like I was just writing myself a letter,
a lot of niggers is wildin and calling a name with disrespect,
cashing and blighting and trowing salt in the game im saying,
im dealing with logic I hope you aint thinking im rude,
lets stop ruin the greatest thing thats been given us food,
cloth and a shelter when its cold whe be staying warm,
imagin if they just take the music and rap was gone,

All praises due to my squad one in the same
Cherish every blessing I have to make y'all witness my name

Put your money where your mouth is double your salary
Hey dude you know we stay rude high on a aquelude
Bust your shit bouncin in a honda prelude

Brickfull make you rip your jeans off

If you ain't noticed yet I have come wit a throne

The way I touch it you can feel it in your bones
Fuck wit the kid cause I'm taking you into another zone
See it don't matter what you think or what you say
I always love for the street every single day
You better get down on your knees, you better pray
Cause goin' against the grain of this Squad
I promise you will pay! (WHOO!)
You see Flipmode is the team that I rep forever
Respecting the Code of Honor staying together
It's getting hot I think you should take off the sweater
Rattle and knock all of your troops who goin to get this cheddar
See when we come I'm wondering how they gon' manage
Show em mysteriously watch how they vanish
See when we finish just analyze all the damage
No matter who you are, we accept any and EVERY challenge (yeah)
Yeah yeah, I think we got 'em again this time
Flipmode c'mon!
[Chorus - 1: Mynx (Busta Rhymes ad-libs)]
I think I - I think wanna say something like this (like this)

To let 'em know that we be hitting it fa' sho
Time goes by, in your life
And we're still here together
[Verse: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you know that this is really not a game
The way I put it down you will remember the name
The way we change it up shit is never the same
And when I'm finished I promise I'll have you niggas feel ashamed
For giving the people shit they ain't really loving
It's funny to me but y'all niggas be buggin'
But it's aight because I will continue flooding the streets
With heat for the ladies and niggas who be thugging
And if you want it then bring shit wit open arms (spread love baby)
While I continuously give you niggas bombs
al Salam Alaykom ... Alaykom Salam
I'm in the abscence of confusion holding the world in my palms
I'm tired of telling you there ain't nothing greater
Swinging the torch and repping for Violator
So tell the DJ to go and turn up the fader
Putting it down for the streets regardless what you saying playa!
How many times am I gunna have to tell y'all?
Flipmode run these streets, c'mon!
[Chorus - 2: Mynx (Busta Rhymes ad-libs)]
I wish I - I wish I had just a little more time (more time)

We'll still be around

[Verse: Rah Digga]
Dirty reppin' the Squad, don't even get me started
Getting worldwide love keeping the street regardless
Ever since kindergarten, always been the sharpest
Doin' this for my fam cause home is where the heart is
Other crews could chill, all of y'all days are numbered
Bus got the Yellow Digga coming in the Navy Hummer
Start quality, guess I should thank my mother
""Bionic Woman"" on the mic like I was Jamie Sommers
Now, I know that you don't wanna really take it there
Digga and Bus you know we make the perfect pair
We keep it gully wit a little latin flare, it's unfair
Oh well, how I still be spitting and keep everybody all up in the mix
It's only right that I shout my brother Swizz
Flipmode and we only making hits
It's like this, c'mon

My mind, ready to go, it's time
I gotta gotta know, where I'm going in l-i-f-e
A constant headache for charlie b
But I take an asprin and sleep
For a bit, then I dream about making more hits
Wake up, it's not funny
The rent is due and I don't got the money
The landlord says ""get out""
Sorry to hear that, no doubt
I work for a jerk that can't understand
Pride and soul cause I'm a man
Minimum wage in the age of the future
Move too slow, damn, it might shoot ya
Make fools out of me and you
I sit relax and just continue
To (to) think (think) that there is
Just too much on my mind
Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (repeat 2x)
[dinco d]
Got up this morning (too much)
Still sleepy and yawning (too much)
My stomach is growling (too much)
The bus is crowding (too much)
I told my boss I'm getting paid (too less)
So I quit, and sit with my last check
I go to the mall and can't get fresh
For 99 dollars and 95 cents
Plus, I don't want to hear it
There's too much on my mind and I can hear it
Calling for the d-i-n-c-o
Here comes my girl, wait, I gotta go
Nah, I'm not running, I'll just say no
And go and tell my homeboy jerell
He can't spell but he knows, relief
(he can't spell but he knows relief)
Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (repeat 4x)
The mind is more delicate, more action than a predicate
You think of things that are never thought of and then settle it
Do this (do that) go here (go there)
It's too much on my mind
The mind is more delicate, more action than a predicate
You think of things that are never thought of and then settle it
No money (no job) no home (no life)

Too much on my mind, just too much on my mind (repeat 4x)

Aw baby, what a feeling, what a way to feel when you're down and beat
You're all by yourself in a little corner, no one to help you
Yo, it's like this, you know sometimes you gotta stand up strong for self
Do the little things on your own
Strive hard, strive for perfection
And I'm a tell you one thing
Leaders of the new school, definitely gonna rule things

It was a nice sunny day until the heat we fell victim
Sex on our minds while I was in her system
Girls with them beatiful, fellas the same
A freak said ""hi"" and we all yelled ""train!""
So we continue on our mission to get some poonanie!
The girl we just met is not worth the money!
She's just hot and ready to serve
Three cool swell brothers who had the nerve
To approach her, throat her, along with the action
She said it's cool making love in this fashion
Trains, planes, and automobiles
It's all in the same it's how the wheels turn (repeat 2x)
[charlie brown]
Engine number one! (yes engine number two? )
Yo tell me what's the problem! (don't you think you can solve them? )
Of course I can (I know you can) we know you can!
So I prepare to make a dance to prove that I'm the man
At first she said ""i'm not with the amtrak""
Gently I convinced her to lay upon her back
All aboard! the brothers coming in, I heard the jigga jigga
So let the fun begin
She got to ride the shotgun dropping off next stop!
On and on, but it still ain't enough
I guess it's left up to engine number three
(to get what? ) what? to get aboard those
Trains, planes, and automobiles
It's all in the same it's how the wheels turn (repeat 2x)
[busta rhymes]
Got on the train and rode the express (yeah rode the express)
? ? ? in the clit of pure bliss
Slim trim, that's what I want to get hitting (some trim)
And knock the boots off of the slim thing, where did you get in?
>from the jeep counter and that was it
She felt against my skin, so once I was ready to begin
To blow up the engine (engine)
A let my best friends ride on the train
(the train!) the train (the train!)
The ch-ch-ch-ch-ch train! c'mon, c'mon
[interlude from grandmaster flash's ""superrappin?""]
Huh! take the train, take the train, take the train!
Huh! take the train, take the train, take the train!
It was a party night and every was breaking
The eyes was screaming and the bass was shaking
And it won't be long til everybody knows
That (milo's) on the beatbox, knowing that (milo's) on the beatbox!
Knowing that (milo's) on the beatbox. gooooooooing...
And, and, and, and, sha-nah-nah!
Get ?em up, move ?em in, get ?em out, move ?em out!
Trains, plane, and automobiles
Get ?em up, move ?em in, get ?em out, move ?em out!
Trains, plane, and automobiles

As I return on my return trip
I had to roll and make this girl flip
So I said, ""fellas? "" (yeah? )
Should I do it like this? (no!) like that? (no!)
Then why is she yelling ""go dinco go!""
Sweating the pain off, letting it drain off
Feeling relaxed as my thing went soft
Never the measure, this is the pleasure
Are you gonna ride again?
[charlie brown]
Yo, never!
Never I'll take your advice
But let me get off my rock, homeslice
Time was just not on my side
Hour after hour it was a long ride
Thinking how I got in so deep
My lolipop shop just would not sleep
Rocking the body in and out like a party
Screaming and creaming, ""come on charlie!""
Cause (charlie says!) I love to rock the body
(charlie says!) it really rings a bell
(charlie says!) I love to rock the house now
Yo busta rhymes throw down!
[busta rhymes]
The train was worth the long trip
I threw the rough rider with the broad hip
Plugged it in and broke the backbone
Like sea to the salt, yo, players grow
Just by adding a little bit of fluid
Busta rode endless to the cut is chewing
Riding and riding, slipping and sliding
The bulletproof board is a ? ? ? combining
In the calm invasion of me and you
One plus one, it equals two
After I did what I had to do
Then subtracted me and I jetted on you, honey
You, yeah you, baby

I'll bring a bigger storm to calm your clouds
I own a couple things; I even own a farm with cows
I own the moment when my niggas run deep through crowds
Like how a pregnant woman breast milk leek through her blouse
A lot of niggas like to wish on a star

Now see, every time we step in a place
I give y'all niggas shit that put a foul look on your face
And rob ice like I was never more able
Don't drink coffee 'cos my diamond be cutting the glass on the table

Before the hungry come and shop on your block
I know some niggas that'd love to blood suck you all
A thing of the past, because them niggas stuck you all
One shot bustin' the same bullet, struck you all
And when they bounce you hear voices screamin' ""FUCK YOU ALL""
Gathered up about a thousand young ?box? who brawl
As decoys, in case they needed to duck you all
That's why you better move tight with your click
Niggas be thirsty and quick
Just to be off into the night with your shit
C'MON, we keep it street to give a damn who you are
Make niggas wile, and bitches spread, and put they hands on the car
Now let me frisk 'em, and shake they asses down to the floor

What them niggas grillin'? What them niggas houndin' me for?""
Before the poundin', ""What them niggas was surroundin' me for?""
Well let me tell you what the fuck we was surroundin' you for
We came to get you once but now I come to get you for more
And while they get and got, niggas drinkin' ten-dollar-henne a shot

Hit the deck, on your mark, get set, we bout to jet
Spark it like ingelet, chickens breakin their neck

A lot of hot ones ready for niggas that act brave
Chill son, you better off if you behave

Lay low, I say so, my pesos
Import my cheese stack by the castros
Make clothes
Or stay fly a chase hoes
Equatorians soft lips and straight nose
Makin dough
When we rippin the paid show
Get the money and dip, we in the Range Rove
Now we makin grands
We name brand
We make plans, change plans
Then we expand across land
Do it properly

Rock the fly tape

The inner soul and the thoughts
Of the Inner Mind's Eye.
Front line 510 to 710 I'm back again
So we send and extend.
Peace to all it's the plural oral B the
Urban rural publicity Afrocentricity
Satellites coincide unifying it's time.
To climb avidly apparently reality
Below zero it makes you pale no color
For the bleach for seasons many reasons.
Equinox equator now who's the raider
And who's the soul who stole the surface?
Sacrifice slice commanding
I'm demanding official awareness we
Share this common understanding.
Word is bond and I give my
Life before my word shall fall,
Do me a favor listen up y'all.
We got to activate social
Activity for one common cause,
Cherish your mind or you will
Perish.
Nigga, relax your temper, so
We can live up to our nature
As civilized men
Everytime we live savage-like, we
Damage like the heads of our
Young little seeds.
Oh! my gosh damn pressure makes,
My eye balls bleed, since when
Was my mind really freed,
it's kind of ill when you don't
Know what time or whose time
You are livin' in, this is the earth
We exist within.
Damn
My mind keep swellin'
While in my inner soul keeps
Tellin' my anger & hate, while
In my verses, I keep yellin'
Let's do this, let's do this,
Let's make a change, so I could
Stop feelin' strange, making a fool out of myself like I am deranged
You better believe it gotta stop.
Yes it gotta stop, word is bond
God! Word is Bond!
I'll be coming around the mountian
Mountain
Mama mia more money nonstop
Solar sex the believer of breather
Taking on all sorts of shit
The devil his wife son daughter
And don't let me see you shoot no dogs
My pit will sit seed in all frequent paths
Infa-ray fake laughs relay or may
I say DJ away okay we stay
Hay play afraid touche uma
Might spray who I'm at least to
Say can really dig it man really
Dig it damn smack deep right in
The mind jack flash jump start
Signing off time often givin' up
Ending up next in line.

Remember me lefty gun up in my right palm

Niggas can't be serious, we wear guns like clothes
But only show em when it's time to blow em in bulk
We been through way worse then war, razor fights and more
Left niggas wit leaks, holes and wide jaw
Be the quiet storm, appear how you wanna scale bar
Check out your weight, see if it's worth to war
We did the street life y'all niggas just got involved
My appetite for guns is similar to carnivores
Dislike me you head on, fight me you dead wrong
Cause now a days you only get wet wit my dead on
Don't let this song push you, the fourth hit you
Have you keyed up gasping for breath on the floor cripple
Infamous we take it to the extremes my words
Especially when a nigga mistake me for herb
Get buried over words, I'm loose wit the dessy bird
I can show ready or tell, y'all niggas heard
[busta rhymes]
Now gitty up now, it's lighting horse back saddleing
Rob beaches like we rowing a boat and we paddleing

Yo rattling niggas who walk badlimp
Beat you in the same place till the blues start blacking

Look at me
Lampin in defiance wit my seats back
Got the game to fuck wit ? jane? where you and her sleep at
Verse 2: rah digga
Lyrically inclined
And inclined to get lyrical
Checkin for residuals
Rhymin be the ritual
Ill individual
Bad habitat
Watch my voice battle cats
While I'm spittin battle raps
On the high horse
And I keep my saddle strapped
You'd be headin up the river like ?where the paddle at? ?
Got a rhyme overload
Rah digga always front ya
Leavin niggaz stuck like I was accupuncture

Got niggaz from the hood
Thinkin shit all good

It makes alot of sense
When you see sham in black benz
With high friends
Pull up the club wit dark tints
Never jump out
Thats why they lookin dead in my mouth
They must have doubts

You'd be amazed and surprised to who would run in your house
And tag their names on the stomach of your pregnant spouse
I shall leave you wit dat
Bib from qb
Boys in black
And foul attitudes to match
Verse 4: busta rhymes
Yo
Now who you be god
I be the soul controller
I burst gas like the fizz outta your coca cola
Live shit like the energy of solar
With thug niggaz wit names like bullet head and cobra

Bear skin furs like australian polar
Hang up on whack bitches who call the motorolla
And smack faggots like you don't make me have ta show ya

Bust 4 in your face pop 4 in your back and
8 bullets total in all I'm street trackin
Verse 6: rocky marciano
2 for my block like 10 in the mornin
Squish your organs like swiss scheese whippin the arm
And flava blaze I play the corner
Wake up your neighbors wit my tape in order to feel my aura
Mauziano I'm like a silver tzar holdin golden
Metal & dough I hold my arm swollen
On the farm belong for soldiers I control is like they seein moses
Fiendin for flows I pose to split you open
Layin back rappers for motion picture me slap on my rappin boots

Verse 7: lord have mercy
The earth is the globe
Where I work my magic like merlin unfold
Surface enclosure
Life worthless no goals
Perfect controls
Like ayatola's turbans and robes
From the counties of kings

50 armies
Probably bring hell on this earth
Legend of dirt
Smash ghettos & general's turf
Menace incredible work
Land lord blaze him and gave him the dirt

+Flipmode is de Squad+ so it's no surprise
Niggas want to advertise about how we get down
You fuck around leave your body in the lost and found
How you like me now?
We got the industry on lock
The world is on shock
I'm a take a piece of the rock
Yo, you feel it in the heart when we took you to the park
Midnight after dark, I'm the raider of the lost ark (ark echo's)

Now na na na na na na, nana nah
Super size, super size, right before your eyes
I bring in treats like giant sweet potato pies
Wise, sword shift and I spit on flies
Killing all the tips from studio spies
Head to bed, beddie bye, beddie bye
Don't ask why, we'll take your ass to paradise
Flipmode's the Squad don't rest, don't try
Peace to my people in the friendly sky
Peace to my outer space ties

I'm in leather like the ladies
Bigger than crack in the 80's {*echoes*}
Drive the buggy I Mercedes
Blow up like C-4
Got so much to live for
Can't play the game no more
Pick up the cain no more
Brothers ain't the same no more
Try to sweat me, what am I aiming for
Get yourself caught up
Faggot ass tore up
In the worst way, the only way you can stop me
is cock your glock and shot me
Drop me, pop me, make sure you that you got me
Cause anytime I live I'm comin back to find you poppy

You failed to realize when you macks me you drop the plastic
Run up in your crib, now you heat me from the mattress

Spit sentences like, venomous iguanas
Reminisce the promise
Bring drama like Nicaragua
Fatigues march, army leaders, they count crooked drug dollars
And sip fresh squeezed milk from the titties of llamas
Leave cities in carnage
Pretty as farmers that pour whiskey at harvest and hold 16 bananas
Maintain, maintain, maintain
I reign like Mussolini's iron fists
Try on this, you can't see me like vagina lips
Smugglin diamond chips, bubblin anonymous
The dominant will resource and count on script crews and world wars

My nine goes bang
I'm talkin street slang
I'm reppin flipmode
Plus I'm doing my thang
On the side
We won't let it ride
Nigga don't hide
(lord have mercy)
Landlord innovator
Switch lanes no indicator
The general, cash generator
Master and saviour
Nigga stay massive in nature
When tooth shatter ya die bone
In the savage cyclone of cops, sirens, and cases
Who read the Bible for basics?
When I'm crooked eye with rivals
Horizontal in god's places
Suspicious of all
Now who dat? ? ?
Quick on the draw
Lick a paw
For loved ones blood runs cold in the winter wars
Check the criminal thoughts
Villains warp with the invisible force
Know the ledge
Stay focused like photo lens
And spread wings like cobra heads
Till I'm old and dead
(busta)
Hot shit, toxic
You know we blocks shit
Traffic in the streets system
All in your jeep knocks shit
Julio for no reason back the fifth
And he cocks it
Rock shit, we make niggas mad
And wanna pop shit
Massive and attractive
Niggas is captive
Chemotherapy needed
Lyrics radioactive
When I hit hard
It get my dick hard
In my backyard
Analyze the stars
On how to defeat all odds
In a new zone
I'm on a new phone
Make most of the wackest rapper niggas
Wanna find a new home
Like rasco jeans
My style flip two-tone
Pass my blue chrome
Here's one of the best of busta rhymes own
My debut made you
Wonder who
Shit blazes so much
You wish you could play out
So you could blaze, too
Before I shout you
Or give reason to doubt you
I study shit and re-analyze everything about you
My rhymes on the preserve
Niggas know we deserve
Everything up in your stash and in the reserve
Fuck that!!!
Hook up all my lyrics on the echos and the re-verbs
Never fuck with these herbs
My squad remains superb
(buckshot)
(heh) walkin thru the streets
Undercovers follow us, stress
Muthafuckas on the regular to bust
Trust us
We don't get enough
Nigga wha-what?
Dirty baggy jeans
Black napsack with something for ya gut
Wooly-type skully
Fully strapped, black bulletproof, and match
Quick,
Whip up a batch
Of bullets to blow up the map
Shit
Collapse, perhaps doing this in the raps
In the long time, ya trapped
Buck make em react
God verse attack
Let em know the moon is still black
And it's a fact...
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Yo stop frontin, ya know we got cha opin
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, yo
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Don't front, you know we got cha opin, kid
Yo stop frontin, you know we got cha opin
Huh, word life
Mad niggas opin

Mad niggas scopin

We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall
See a nigga survived the worst
But my life is glorious (uh!)
But I know that I leaped every hurdle
And I'm so victorious (uh!)
Take a look I'm a symbol of greatness
Now call a nigga Morpheus (yeah)
As force securin' the win, but they
Believe I'm so notorious (yeah)
You know that I've been 'bout my bread
Even though we rappin' now (yes)
We used to live on the strip even though
A nigga higher level trappin' now (oh!)
Superseded everyone of my little struggles and (uh!)
So your head never ever been an option (trust)
A nigga paper long like rush hour traffic
And I'm about to take the hood shoppin' (get it!)
Chorus
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)
Forever we waited (ah hah)
And they told us we were never gonna
Get it But we took it on the road

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yo
When it all got started we were steadily
Just getting rejected
And it seemed like nothin' we could do
would ever get us respected
At best we were stressed at the worst
They probably said we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle
Just the way to connect it
I was fighting through every rhyme
Tightening up every line
Never restin' the question if I
Was out of my mind
It finally came time to do it and let it die
So we put the chips on the table and
Told them to let it ride, sing it (yeah)
Chorus
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs

Yeah, yeah, yeah, look
In case you misunderstand exactly what I'm buildin'
This shit that I can leave for
My children's (children's) children's (children)
Now on the wake up I smile, to see how far I've come (yeah)
Fighting for sales when I'm stripped
To negate the hustle from (yeah)
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son (yeah)
To countin' money like Dre and Jimmy and Russel was (yeah nigga)
But now I live when I dream, you see we finally did it (oh!)
Let's make a toast to the hustle
Regardless how you get it, sing it
Chorus
Together we made it (you see we did it niggas)
We made it even though we had our backs
Up against the wall (come on)

big foot raps nigga let's make dough
pull up to the lot, valet the Range Rove
flyer than a motherfucker, all day glow
in the club nigga glow in the dark and lay low
bang your head to this shit, while the beat play slow
junior varsity niggas while we play pro
ringside seats we all in the same row
like a crew of bitches pull up and dodge the ragos
and how we dazzle these bitches with how we change flows
we take your slot, how a bitch take half
and rock chains with pieces the size of spacecrafts
you know what I rep, that's Flipmode Squad!!
wildin like a thousand niggas up in the wreck yard
[CHORUS:]
Callin all live niggas
BOOYAH!!

raunchy as fuck, even they like it like that
Busta Rhymes in this bitch you know I got another batch
more hotter shit nigga strike another match
bang this shit in your truck, nigga open up the hatch
and hold on your jewels before your shit get snatched
better lock your doors, slide across the latch
before we figure out the next vic to catch
so much lyrics flowin to throw in a teacup
more crack for y'all we just reed up
gutter like a piss test in a pee cup
switch the bounce for the streets, had to change the speed up
raw for the bitches who thick and beefed up
strip a club, big titty bitches double D cup
we all up in the truck, what the fuck we treed up
pure coke for niggas, get skeed up
let me bang something hard on your head like Vince Carter
and charter jets for my niggas with automatic starters
blow shit regular like the UniBomber
surprise attack you niggas like fuckin Pearl Harbor
jailhouse raps, let it bang a little harder
while I rep for the fam, Busta Rhymes the godfather
[CHORUS 2X]
so remarkable
classic rugged nigga music
big truck shit
20 inch rims on a UConn or something
a fuckin Escalade, Navigator

Branded... scorned is the one who raaaan
What do you do when your branded? And you know you're a man.
Wherever you go, for the rest of your life
You must proooooove, you're a man
[Verse 1: Busta]
See now I'm back wit the force, read about the kid
from the front to the back of The Source
You see me back on the course
Scream on every beat untill my voice get crackled and horse
Front seat niggas never sit in the back wit a boss
Fuck the fact that it cost, the pricetag of the porche
Will cost ya life, have ya motha feel an immaculate loss
*Breath* But of course, come and speak to the best
And watch me spit a jewel sharper to carve the meat of your flesh
You lookin weak in the chest, you see the street is a test
Women on the stoop smokin holdin a seed to they breast
You see the street is a mess
Strugglin holdin a couple pounds of weed then the rest
Now I proceed to the rest of my niggas Keepin it fresh,
Though we must stay on the grind I supersceded the stress,
We always seem to finesse from the East to the West,
You Know we w-w-we keep the teflon from the street to the vest
Kill that nigga slow like how you get defeated in chess
Got you under pressure--hairline receaded effects
Hot air niggas I only feel the heat from your breath,
Rap niggas beef in they album probably needed the press
And as a man I never found the slightest need to impress
Another man because I'm proud and I believe that I'm blessed
But yo I always found the need to adress these weaker niggas
That speak to the street always keepin the people abreast
Now you've been branded...
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Busta]
Higher science and I'm changin the crime in,
Watch my son cuz you'd be fuckin wit the child of a Giant
Im in a place stuck between bein lovin and violent, [voice switch]
Becomin more of a threat when I move subtle and silent,
Then set it off to be the only one to quiet the riot
My destiny's the only thing between the sky and the pilot,
Relate, it's like bustin a 3-8
Be late, I be takin most of the brick leavin a pile outta shape
I never quit watchin these niggas try to hide they mistake,
Takin a shit watchin they body floatin by in the lake
Make it quick you weak niggas better try to escape,
And create the quickest way to reach the fire escape.
Snitch niggas always quick to go and lie on a tape,
But it's o-k cuz Super Hero niggas die wit a cape,
It's so great to watch them finally break, stand aside from the fake
Street niggas gotta slide for the take
Bein broke and not bein able to buy me a steak
Stackin my paper so see now I can buy an estate,
so I rely on the love and I reply to the hate
So much pain in the struggle my whole body'll ache...come on...
From the gates, so awake that was the plan of my fate
Now I'm straight...got me my OWN knife and fork on my plate
Wanna scorch a debate, wait...do me a favor nigga jus REMEMBER
The date...cuz you been...

How many diamonds you got on? shit 37 hundred
I'm stunting pissy popping by the bottle
Got nothing under the trench and I'm not from colorado
Your acting a little like your rapping to riddles
Got harlem looking like we a pack of skittles
I'm a tyko fanatic, phsyco sematic,
Type blow ? gamatic? , life go dramatic
Hydro's a habit bitch
[busta rhymes](chorus)
All my niggas who's ready to ride niggas, what what
All my soldiers and my living foul niggas, what what
Money niggas, what what, thug niggas, what what,
Grimy niggas, whatwhat,
Big gun niggas, what what
All my bitches that's ready to wild with me, what what
And fuck a hole away in the ground with me, what what
Money bitches, what what, thug bitches, what what,
Corporate bitches, what what
All the above bitches
[cam'ron]
Imagine a ho kissing me, a ho dissing me
No I can't have that, not from rottisearre
Roglissere, gators so slippery
Best affiliated with the movie misery
I make you kids learn, when your car gone,
Crib burned, jim jones shit permed like big ern
And you speak that gang gang slang,
Gun like pop from boomerangbang bang bang
That girl looking, you packing a whore,
Slapping a whore, foot sweppers slacking the door
Laughing for sure, yeah that shit happend before
Bitch flurting with me, her man tapping the jaw
What I'm drunk about, what I smoke skunk about
Hope you make it to that year prince sung about
All these years dripping and ducking
Stay with birds the ones I was flipping and fucking
Ya heard

What you want
What the fuck nigga (We gon hit it down like this nigga what)
Check it out
I be
Testing your fate and wrecking your face
Invading your space
And watch the tables turn like you're trading a place
I pull stunts like evil kadeival
Me and my people fly like an eagle
And blow your entire cathingil
Hurry hurry
Don't worry worry
Hit y'all with a flurry flurry of jazz
Leaving y'all niggas blurry blurry
Brew up some shit like I'm cooking for y'all
When I'm done then I come looking for y'all
(Huh huh hold up hold up)
Federal cases cause nuff bodies end up in medical places
In they blood finding them chemical traces
Leaving special investigators going through skeptical phases
While we getting money the decimal changes
I was a seven-day affentice apprentice
Now I strike with a vengeance
Blowing the door right up off of the hinges
This be that put you out of your misery song
And make you ask your man is this the joint he dissing me on
That's when I ask

Moving your muscle and doing the hustle
See nowadays we getting money like rustle
Who really wanna tussle
Challenge the super saber in a nigga
Blast the challenger way out of space like Galica nigga
Battle star Galactica cross my diameter nigga
Derange your whole circular shape into triangular nigga
Yo
So what it was my fault
That I had to bring this shit to a screaming halt
What you need to do is open up the vault
That's why I make sure that my vest will be on
So when I blast you and your additional stress will be gone
Then I sprinkle just a little bit of salt on your plans
And watch your shit shrivel up right in the palm of my hands
I ain't afraid of ya
But I thank all of my niggas for saving ya
I was about to take you back
To when your mother was making ya
Clapping you up
Slapping you up
Trapping you up
Holding you hostage
Duck taping and Saran wrapping you up
Yo
First she was sober
I smell aroma
Put you in a Trans
And slip into an irreversible coma
Fuck y'all cubic zirconium niggas it's over
Closing in on all y'all niggas
While we're moving in a little closer
Then I evaluate and elaborate
Confiscate your shit and dare your ass to retaliate
That's when I ask

Yeah! Yeah, Busta Bust down, Flipmode now
I know what y'all feel like doin
Go 'head and crash your whip in the fuckin wall
It's cool, niggaz.. we gets busy
[Verse One]
Fo' sho', spit rogue, get mo' bout to kick in the door
Dick sore, split whores 'til they shit on the floor
Clique more sick from when you use to see us before
Shit, kill a nigga quick, niggaz know my rapport
Keep workers on the strip that be ready for war
Brick I flip a little quicker if they shit in the store
Rip, maybe 'til they drop, and they shit in they drawers
Shit crazy when I pop, and I'm grippin the four
Thick bitches in the spot, watch 'em strip for the sport
Spit vicious for the block, yeah we swingin a torch
Stick niggaz for they shit, thank 'em for they support
Quick nigga, better quit snitchin down at the court
Check track a little slick and try to go on my Forbes
Cause we stackin like we rich, and we holdin the fort
This time, we had to bring it, guess what we brought
The hottest shit to bang from L.A. to the streets of New York
[Chorus]
All my people, get drunk, get high - WHATTUP?
Get money, get rich, get fly - WHATTUP?
Get stupid, get busy, get live - WHATTUP?
Jump all in your whip, turn the key and drive - WHATTUP?
Make a mill' yeah we gon' make about five - WHATTUP?

Once again you know we only come to get it - WHATTUP?
[Verse Two]
AOWWWWWWW!! Ha, I stay wicked now I'm back on the strip
Like I went on a vacation and I'm back from my trip
Nuff radio rotation like I'm sailin a ship
Or when the team circle the block, busy trailin my clique
Truck packed fulla niggaz with the strap and the whip
Get the gat out of the stash, put it back on my hip
Gat butt you in the face, split and fatten your lip
Blood hit the floor louder than the clap when it drip
I credit your name with bullets, read the back of the script
My victim's initials engraved on the back of the clip
Chicks love the way we roll, how the movement is thick
So official like my name's on the back of your bitch
Pay triple for the name on the back of the stitch
Name like the whole city now I'm changin the pitch
Kick back kinda crazy when I'm holdin the fifth
Think you nicer than the God, shit is only a myth
Grab ahold of the masses, I was born with a gift
Niggaz be runnin they trap, throw 'em over the cliff
Thinkin and drinkin the Guinness, busy holdin the spliff
Flippin and shittin on niggaz 'til we old and we stiff
I don't even drive whips, throw the shit on the lift
12 hours, one worker do the whole of the shift
I do the thing to make you open your mouth
And give you shit to bang the Midwest and the rest of the South

Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Yo check it out, yo Brown, coming up with the sound all around
Check it out, L.O.N.S. for '90 y'all,
Ahhh! What's up? Do I got the hands in the air?
Yo did I make moves, did I make moves?
Yo, ow! Did I make moves yo, so check it out, yo
This is a theory that I've come up with
Between my mind and my heart there's no riff
My story starts off in turtle hawk
Where the Browns bought me sneakers and the back rhyme book
Yo battling for ranks, I didn't have the banks
Ahhhh! Yeah, I simply got to thanks
But yo that was cool cause I kept striving
To go to high school and I kept climbing
A man with a shock from five ten
Gave me promises and dreams, said the contracts would end
For years sweating tears and frustration
Walking and talking, 360 rotations
Oh yeah, Lying Brian, where is your record?
The girls are coming up in a matter of seconds
Ahh! Ahh! Who you think you're fooling?
With those played-out lottos, you know you ain't cooling
Distressed in class, troopers say ""Stay up""
It's hard to stay up when they're pulling me down, you know
Times move on, graduation countdown
School with Lion's Den, he's a clown
Imporant, decisions, to make
Years of tears, everything's at stake
I had the strength to believe in me made Charlie B
Take a risk and y'all see
I shot for the stars and you know I caught it
Dinco D, Busta Rhymes, and Milo saw it
Two years of hell, now we're paid off
To prove my rhymes, that it ain't soft
Yo! Elektra selects a new breed to lead them
In the '90 with success and then
Make everyone look leary
Awww! They know, Pinocchio's Theory
Aww! They know, you check it out for the '90
Dinco D, Busta Rhymes, and Milo's in the place to be, check it out
A boy came down every day with the girls
He's jabbering on the mix nonsense
Pinocchio, questions remain
To the likely, notorious win
Ex you're zoning, ahhh!, you're zoning
I made moves, cut cut!
Cut, making move, making move, ahhh!
Clear the rhythm
A B C D E F G, H I J K L M N O P
Q R S, T U V, W X Y Z
Now I know my ABC's, next time won't you sing with me?

Truck jeweling it, watch the medallion swing
So fast nigga forget shit as time past
Break a piece of glass quick to amputate your ass
The title wave movin' faster than the speed of sound

The more the heavy the more the solid

Yo, take it easy while back at the ranch

The most influential, whether in projects or
suburban residential
Fuck that
We keep the livest niggas happy then we blow the
spot quick, give me money make it snappy
Oh my God, Flipmode is the squidaud
It's wrong if you dear step a foot in my yard
My protocol is to create
Substances abuse lyrics like alcohol
Nigga try to recall
When I hit you you ain't even know that you was gonna fall
Cut your shit up turned around and bumped your head and all
Leavin' lizard
Always remain grand wizard
Fuck around and sleep nigga you get caught up in my blizzard
askin who is it
My niggas ain't around I ain't with it
Aiiyo yo yo yo
We here to stay fuck payin a visit
So consistent, demand everybodys assistant
Let us reach for all things without any resistant
Fatality, for all those in the world that might be mad at me
Suffer in the faces of my immortality
To the one who didn't make it
Now in every way I hope you know where we about to take it
In every way I hope you know where we about to take it

Where you think you goin, nigga. Come back here.
Y'all niggaz ain't seein Jack. Shit !!!
Verse 1: Baby Sham
Aiiyo, speak the truth.
Too short to let it hurt. Some talk dirt, and be the first slangin hertz.
Freestylin of the hum of the birds.
Fall back when I shine on my shine, two shows follow behind.
It's a fucked up vehicle. Switchin my lines.
Hotel asks a nigga: ""Could I share my dimes?.
Picture that, when you scared to draw toes.
Playin me close.
Rollin with the dogs wearin yesterdays clothes.
Left a fouled sin into my squad without permition.
I started dissin, hopin you listen. Pay attention.
Fatheresly. The shadow leads you back to the hood.
You wanna switch up because some niggas stalked you up.
Or is the fact that they thought you was rollin with us.
Left you all draged, like two trains crashin it up.
Verse 2: Spliff Starr
Aiiyo, Spliff Starr drama.
Bullet him to sonna.
Type of nigga that would sell crack to your mama.
Take the cash and give me a bind Marijuana.
Check me bound, and some turn bull panic .
Back in the days. I'm off the drugs like a sonna.
Nigga pushin ! boy. Kill emselves like no other.
Kid don't like Blues brothers.
Cold weather rock the ramma.
Lye in front off the Jerry D.A. And ya .
I represent street niggas, carry heat niggas.
Wants to keep niggas. Ain't nothing but these sweet niggas.
I stay tooken. Gun but cha scar open.
If you fuck wit my squad nigga where you think you goin.
Corus:
Where you think you goin.
Where you think you goin.
Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.
Where you think you goin.

Aiiyo, what you doin nigga.

Verse 3: Busta Rhymes
You think that you can run (ha)
You think that you can hide (haa)
You best believe you still comin. I think you better slide.
While you stay bitchin, another nigga missin.
Bodies snatch you up.! Behold the cream. .
Cought in hells kitchen. My trigger fingers itchin.
Nervous system's fucked up.
That's why my nerves twitchin.
Inslave your mentality. Nigga brain fried.
We after you, runnin sergeon for a free ride.
Where you think you goin son ?
We gon? catch you soon.
We here to take over this shit.
Pour the tycoon.
Blossom and gloom. Capture any nigga sober in a little dark room.
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Verse 4: Rah Digga
Uh oh. You lil league boy I know your beats.
You sound bullshitely, You rock .
Swearin you to ball, when you know you're wack.
In a studio settin of a reverands track.
Boy ! Rah gets busy, my shit be way slaver.
Curder rapper Ernest like the one slave labour.
One first be like the bitch tap oil.
Loyal to my niggas. Enemies are fucked around, and riders rappin for you.
Spot stays blowin. Goin' to the top.

Pocket stay throwin. Smooth like the lowin.
Rap chick flowin.
Where you think you're goin.

Verse 5: Rampage
I'm a hard man at work.
Lyrical expert.
Look out before you get hurt.
Bury the dirt. Line for line.
Ramp I be the mastermind.
That's be full time watch me shine.
I know the seven sign.
I'm rich, and still life is a bitch.
Losin? snitch like camey fake beggar.
Jim Baker. I take you're life like the undertaker.
Flipmode money-maker, make that kill for this paper.
It's on the poppin.
People wanna know when the album droppin.
Start talkin. Keep walkin.
Flatbush New York and we live for you.
Sling for you.
My squad struck oil.

Diamond rings. Nice cosy things.
And a party for free.
From the tunnel to envy.

Chief gunnin to.
Splash rain potters pooves.
Fuck is you. Start stand peach.
Chuff for choose.
Scoffer booves.

Son gets school, wit the dummin crew.
Pay double dues. Cradle to the graves, hustle grooves.
Flesh tissue. Death kiss you. No love for you.
Ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
And me the most wanted fool.
Unfriendly in horrical, make power moves.
Snatch colors loose. A  dollar rule.
Raw business shit in my hands, and shakes yours with it.
Till you cause fridget.
Local or long distance.
Gets master served.
And crash a burn

[DMX]
Uhh, that's some shit..
..that that that niggaz ain't even seen before
That's that shit! (Motherfuckers ain't never seen
nothing like this before, for real man)
It's goin down baby, uhh..
UHH! Busta Rhymes
WHAT?! Uhh, DMX nigga
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
I see ghosts clearly; even though, most don't hear me
They still wanna get near me - fear me, so I'm leary
Kinda eerie what I'm feelin - from the floor, to the ceilin
Straight through the roof, want the truth?
I kinda miss robbin and stealin
cause it kept a nigga hungry, only eatin when I starved
I was ugly, so I robbed, no one loved me, shit was hard
Went to God once in a while when it got a little too hectic
He was the only one I knew that I respected (WHY?)
Didn't know why, didn't know what I was livin was a lie
If I ain't shit then, why should I try
See, plenty niggaz die, over dumb shit, up in the hood
Real good heart, but up to no good
Thought I did what I could, but I guess it, wasn't enough
The Devil told me it would happen but I kept callin his bluff
When it rains it pours now, my pains are yours
as yours are what's mine, define, revolvin doors (nigga!)
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
(Why?) All my niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Cause we crazy with it, quick to blaze you with it
From in my soul to every word that I curse
with all the agony expressed in this verse;
let me ask my niggaz (why?)
My niggaz tell me (why) tell me (we die)
Because we Gods nigga (and) we go the yard nigga
Because I walk the ground under my feet
and keep it live and stay in tune with the street
Now let me ask my niggaz (why?)
[Jay-Z]
They say the good die young, in the hood where I'm from
I only got one question to that - why the fuck am I here?
I look to the air, I ask God, ""Love me please,""
but in reality, only people that hug me is thieves
Same niggaz that send shots through my rugby sleeves
They wanna, slug me and leave, I'm thinkin it must be me
Please shed light, the hood's dark
I did my dirt but got a good heart
Shouldn't that count for somethin?
I was told I'd amount to nothin, most of my childhood
Liked by folks it was stuntin my growth
Seperated me from the shit I was wantin the most
Felt myself comin close to pumpin them O's
Lump in my throat, chest poked out, face was poker
Tryin to, erase my ghostes, chase the smokers
Got demons on both shoulders,
tryin to chauffeur my life through the streets
In other words nigga my will was weak
Please feel what I speak,
this ain't your average ordinary jargon
weak rap niggaz be talkin
This shit is deep, from the mind of Busta, 'X and me
To all my fallen soldiers, rest in peace, til we meet niggaz
[Chorus w/ minor variations]
[Busta Rhymes]
I must be cuckoo, like I respect the new-you, never
See you too could get it through your FUBU sweater
like a nigga when he walk in the dark, trespassin
on a nigga land, shots echo loud in the park
I live and die for all the shit I believe
And rep for everything I stand for
with every single breath I breathe
Like the intake from cigarette smoke, it's like you inhale
the demon in the gutter stressed struggled and broke
If the shit was all over tomorrow, I'd leave a treasure
for my kids with a legacy for my CHILDREN to follow
You know it's funny how the good die first
Get the peppin in your steppin faggot nigga
cause you could die worse
Hold on, you know I cut off my arm, in the name of reppin
REAL NIGGAZ in the midst of droppin this bomb
Allah blessin me to rep for the better, and carry on
somethin great and keep a nigga name livin forever!
[Chorus w/ minor variations]

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...
Jah and Busta-Bus (Heh)
Jaheim and Busta baby (Heh)
Jah and Busta baby...
[Busta Rhymes]
Yeah.. wife in law, my bitch for the triflin whore
Type of bitch to make a nigga get the right things for
Bitch sexy, and beautiful, and gangsta, and golden
Love to fuck a nigga till the pussy dry and swollen
My lil' bitch had a figure like a wine glass
Slim bitch stackin like a muhfucker with a fine ass
Word to mother; bitch nasty like me
Love to fuck a nigga in places where people could see
The bitch send a chill like cold freezin a nigga
The way she holdin and bitin and suckin and squeezin a nigga
Down and dirty bitch never dick teasin a nigga
Got her own paper and focused on pleasin a nigga
She ain't out for gettin a nigga or fuckin my life
She only wanna fuck a nigga while he fuckin his wife
There was nuttin she couldn't achieve
In the mornin bitch was across the street waitin for wifey to leave
Called me on the cell while the wife was runnin a bath
She can't wait for me to fuck her, till I cum in her ass
Just a long-time chick I used to fuck from the past
She love to out-fuck a nigga, see how long I could last
It be nice the way she always let me dig in her rib
The bitch fuck a nigga like she wanna move in my crib
Bitch I always knew ya ass was a star
In the daytime, whippin the droptop, givin me head in my car
[Chorus - Jaheim]
When a woman needs love, just like you do
Oh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that you don't
Cuz she will fool around, just like you do
Ohh, don't kid yourself, into thinkin that she won't
[Busta Rhymes]
C'mere bitch and place ya pussy right where it belong
And put me in the mood to fuck just like a Jodeci song
I love the little freaky shit you be approachin me on
Dick all in ya mouth, you know what type of shit I be on
The way the pussy lock feel like we about to be stuck
All outside busy, givin me the balcony fuck
Hold on get up off of me quick
Bitch grab the X.O. and suck the Hennessey up off of my dick
So quick, so fast, bitch'll come out her skirt
Fuck a nigga till it hurt, while the wifey at work
The bitch'll even call her girl so I can fuck with her friend
And fall asleep to wake up and start fuckin again
Straigh nasty little bitch no horsin around
The bitch even want me to fuck her when she walkin around
Hold up, it's kinda ill how we be workin the caper
She ain't only good for pussy, she be givin me paper
Wife-in-law, my bitch be always keepin it raw
Always slidin out before the wifey walk in the door
They way she fuck me on straight for the night
Wifey still ain't make it home, I wonder if she workin late for tonight
Wifey actin funny style but I ain't fuckin with that
She ain't call the crib so I wonder where wifey was at
Hmmm.. shit kinda had me buggin before
But now I laugh because wifey had a husband-in-law
[Chorus 2x]
Heh... Heh...

You can witness the style that I kick from the linguistics
But please come, so save it
Dealin? with the try, but you never can

Freeze like chilly willy the eskimo
Vigilante like steven segal
Now bust the desperado
You fuckin? with the all time pros
While the zoom lens ammorate niggas from transistor radios
Mission impossible without expose
Once I diagnose those who be creepin? blow ?em off they tippy toes
Sorry, fake nigga that's how it goes
Sport the suede-front bullet proof vests in case
You complicate my dough
Handle situations pronto
While appearances got you all hearin? this when I be doin? cameos
Shit be wild hot like tabasco
Fuck the fool-ass nigga trespass and caught him in my last zone
Stick a nigga bad like the last hole
Runnin? up on muthafuckas late night jumpin? out the astro
No, no,no,no,no

Make you dreadlock yo? afro
And when I'm done I ride of with theme music by my man d'angelo

Aiyo, where my niggas at?
Fuck, my niggas is at?
Where my Leaders Of The New School niggas is at?
Yo, aiyo C Brown, C Brown where the fuck you at, dun?
Aiyo Milo, Milo and the dance, where the fuck you at, nigga?
Aiyo aiyo Dinco, where you at, son?
Where the fuck my Leaders niggas is at, man?
Fuck man, I'm ready to grab my niggas
Them niggas need to go to blow or sometin
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Runnin faster than the speed of a bullet)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
(Has more rhymes than any other DJ that has craps)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Able to leap sucker MC's in a single bound)
Keep it movin', keep it movin' (Look at the jam of the mic)
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along (It's the L-the O-the N-the S)
Verse 1: Dinco, Milo
Three in this to grass it up like me
Besides TNT, see an N and BG
My visionary which is skippin on my D-O-G
I guess it was a S-O-S from G-O-D
Chaos has arisen interteller space souls (SOULS!)
Cellular, good ridance, like keypads wit ol' bass
Third planet states while the rest of the world waits (WAITS!)
Joy to the world, meaning hell, snow and earthquakes
Participates, modulates
If comets were round plates, bitten names gates
For only those that ???? relates, case after case (CASE!)
Dinco's on the next space
Movin strategically in the Solar System's waste (RAHHH!)
Size 25, the lymph still be in place (HAHHH!)
Stretch and extending, for flexin is impending
It's not mind-bending or *?refriending?* to keep remembering (HMMM!)
Cos everybody's people gonna die, or believe (WOO-HOO!)
we dispense necessity, to shout and receive
KEEP IT MOVIN' ALONG
People in the party, are you really feelin?
We ain't seein eye-to-eye so you ain't really seein (SEE!)
I be hippin all type of niggas, sayin fuck that nigga Blow
When they see me in the party, they better act like they know
YO, we connectin dots that makes spots hot
Uhh, to the beat'cha (Y'ALL!), ah ya don't stop (STOP!)
Notice, how many groups can formulate then lose focus
With a lot of hocus pocus, concepts that sound bogus
I'm seein the world and all its different kind of poses (WOO!)
Crush you like roaches, that's keepin the crowd movin (HAA!)
Mr and the dancers, who said ""Culture consumin?""
Never face, he ????? ????? and strength
Cos I can terminate, like a dirty hypodermic needle
My vision's clearer than the sights on an eagle
Stop them bustin high, bring the head back to my table
Don't front, circle circle, dot dot, you catch your speed, not
Feel that, cos this type of vibe sounds done
(Far from the...., to the doe-run-run-run to the doe-run-run)
(YES!) Yes to the beat-boys and your ass accepted
Exclusive, L-O-N-S bringin the ruckus, wild aggressive
Chorus:
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Verse 2: Charlie Brown, Busta Rhymes
Now don't get me wrong, CHILL!!!
Let me out, no question, no doubt
????? god is a drought
I've come to wet the party like a tropical depression
????? mixed with scherm for this musical session
(STOP!) stressin, testin, second-guessin, who's 'fessin?
Life is a lesson in disguise like a blessin
Blinkin, kickin, better back up chickens
The guns stun split, I keep it real, front *?worm?* (*?WORM!?*)
Cos I'm like a ???? hands therapeutic
Measurements, square, feet, and cubic
We're all makin pennies off a record, so who needs the paper? (WHO?)
The man in Manhatten lampin in the skyscrapers
How much can a nigga take before he break fool?
I tell ya cool, with the New School
And the tool to examine my unorthodox pattern
>From Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn
and don't forget Uranus, Neptune and Pluto
Flow deeper than the lava inside a volcano, bro
(Never snitch, never dominate
I'll be wild, smokin drowsy)
Fuckin up my economics, is it rather ironic
Sippin gin, juice and tonic
Like Shawn Kemp with some hemp, super sound and sonic
Baby, above your head, below your feet and it still wimp
C-Boogie Brown, my shit is brilliant
Yah yah, yah (AHH!)
My shit be so ginamic
and I'ma take 4 steps and cross the whole Titanic
Better believe I (KEEP!) movin (OVER!) people ?????
You know my crew funk, bringin in full flaga'
Bringin it back like I'm fresh out the box, pair of broke ass 69ers
(IS THERE NUTTIN NEW?) All in the house so open up your blinders
Yo, I be the Moses takin poses
When the wine flows so beautiful like a large bouquet of roses
Chorus:
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin'
Verse 3: Busta Rhymes
Keep it movin now
No need to try to stop it, we gon' wreck shit anyhow
Your, limitations is somethin I never will allow
When we bake the cake, I be that nigga that brings the icing
Disregard your whole identity and revoke your driver's licence
You know I blast in your ass real fast
Got your bladder burning, desperate for a bathroom pass
My ????? like a Busta Rhymes statue made of grass
C'mon, hypnotise some ass, shit so hot, better jump in the water, nigga
(SPLASH!)
Breakin fools at parties like a ruckus sound class
Make a philly down the back and mix the weed with more hash
I will wash away your pain like Draino
Erupting like the angriest volcano, or the wickedest whirlwind and tornado
We stay up in the streets, cruisin, me and my whole crew, gotta.......
Chorus:
Keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin', keep it movin'
Keep it movin' along, keep it movin' along
Keep it movin'
Outro:
This one goes out
to the three brothers that I love the most, in memory of this song
My man Ratto, my man Big Joe, my nigga Love
Them niggas rest, most comfortable
Peace, L-O-N-S, forever

What we drop and how we keep shit comin
How we maneuver so fly (fly), so high is where we gon' take it
Controllin the land, controllin the sea
Now we control the whole sky; perhaps make niggaz collapse
Make bitches shake they shit to the floor

Wonderin how we gon' come again
My golden rule is not to focus on the fame game

Here to rep the game fully, change my style like the weather
Givin you niggaz new shit to make the game feel better

I'm tired of niggaz complainin how the game changed
You niggaz should step up your game, cause you sound strange
That's why you ain't sellin no records, check the SoundScain
In this rap shit I command respect muh'fucker cause I
Chorus
Aiyyo these niggaz in the game don't sound the same
Bust, these niggaz in the game don't sound the same
Aiyyo what happened? {They ain't got in 'em to make a classic}
Aiyyo what happened? {These niggaz can't hold the torch, so why pass it}

[Busta Rhymes]	Greg Nice, Busta Rhymes in the place to be
And for the whole entire world to see
Fuckin up your whole entire par-ty
Chorus: Greg Nice, Busta RHymes
Busta Rhymes and Greg Nice we never fa-il
(You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll)
My shit stay fresh never ever ever stale
(You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll)
Foot shock to your ass just like the third ra-il
(You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll)
Snitches get stitches when they go to ja-il
(You won't te-ll, I won't te-ll)
Verse One: Greg Nice
Sometimes I feel like Bobby's World
Rocked the mic, before jheri curl
Single, mingle, no main girl
On the low, like Secret Squirrel
Uhh!  It's time to Patti Duke
So shake whatcha mamma gave ya like Luke
It's Greg N-I always down to juice
Too much Hennesey make ya puke
Now I bust on indo dreams
Uhh, I don't be fuckin with keys
Rock the shell-top, or pin-striped Lee's
I could write a song make a hundred G's
You went back to high school, nuthin but a tease
Know I got stones, call me Mr. Please Please
Walkin down the street wit yo'
box in your hand... hot damn!
I never drove a Lex dog, never drove a Land
or a Testarossa, rather puff L's
and I sip on mimosa, bedroom wall
homegirl have my poster, I'm not surprised
That's the way it's supposed to, makes ya hot
Much hotter than a toaster, style elevates
like a roller coaster
Chorus
Verse Two: Busta Rhymes
Yo, the greatest unsolved mystery
of how I rotate your chicken golden rotissiere
Freak the cheesecake flow from here to Sicily
You really need to get offa my, hickory-dickory
The main attraction, even freaks the close caption
Snap break a piece off, a little small fraction
I still fulfill your dissatisfaction
I'm in the process, of completing a transaction
Huh, Carnegie Hall, like a opera singer nigga
Still doin the yes y'all, uhh!
Today we bust guns in the future we bustin lasers
Out of range in case you tried to reach me through my pager
I'm bout to blaze ya, with the flows that will amaze ya
Hot to death nigga, call me Smokin Joe Frazier
Seal up the box and present the closed casket
Busta Rhymes got the boombastic fruit basket
Bend your ass back, stretch you like elastic
More drastic when I be feelin fantastic, uhh!
Caught the chills stack the large bills barbeque on the grill
Me and my niggaz grant wills
Niggaz talkin shit but they ain't got no skills
Lookin like they full of shit your niggaz named you no frills
Don't let me catch you takin for granted
When my lyrical cause will leave y'all niggaz stranded
Distributed by, Warner Elektra and Atlantic
Niggaz thought they could fly, but really crash landed
Hah, when I'm in the place I'm up in your house
All y'all corny motherfuckers need to shut your mouth!

Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista still
[Verse 1]
Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, cuz she know she a star
Did you wanna ride in my car?
[Hook]
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you wanna blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?
[Verse 2]
In the mood, like yes y'all
Rather be, let it test y'all
Light the B if it's special
Can I undress to relax y'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the 5 double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough
Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?
An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?
[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a 50ball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin thru stunting why are you running
Cuz I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming thru balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb.............
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cuz' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P
Now baby, do u?

[Johnny P] Let me play with your emotions
[Verse One: Twista]
Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
That's what the hoe came up and told me
Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be
Cause I be pimpin her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick
you better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
cause I ain't even on that petty shit
So who the fuck do I competi with?
The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin for me pickin a fit
I got them heffer's nose red
and when we get in the bed, I be leavin em with rose legs
Stuffin that made em wanna pose dead
but you already got em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin
but it's the bomb when I be havin them cuties thinkin
I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em
Be gettin pub with em, in a club with em
Smokin dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em
After gettin paid from her she ain't trippin
cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin with the game on ways to make mo'
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
[Johnny P in background:] let me playyyyy, with your emotions
(Let me play with your) emotions hoe
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that...
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that
[Verse Two: Twista]
Now how the fuck you gon' act hoe, I saw you creepin out the back do'
What you runnin from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow
cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs
it's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
if you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain
pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin em up with adrenaline, got em geekin
we're speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on
with a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
you can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
a shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
then she signed on the dotted-line, the hoe was like
""Oooohh Daddy... why you doin me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head""
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up
like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn
then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess it's cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did
but game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin to gold dig, now
[Chorus]
Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby
[Verse Three: Twista]
I know you think it's blasphemy
but won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see
and when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy
that I can get her so gone, the hoe be trippin talkin up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock
or when I rub the twat, or pickin up a dub at spots
Fuck the hoe thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin with em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
Sso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin
motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion, the grey poupon
them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
and let me pull my pouch of snuff
In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe
and let your tongue go coastin low, now

Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother would've made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick,
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer,
When the streets get the upper hand on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in the zone,
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a soul to fly,
Take away the pain out your hands and help you hold them high, And I
Wish my homie Butch was still alive
And on the day of his death we had never took that ride, And I (I wish)
Wish God could protect us from the wrong
So that all the soldiers that were sent over seas come home and, uh,
We will never break, though they devastate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, cause we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life goes on!!!

Instead of hating so much when you see some other people coming up (I wish)

Watch the music and have 'em tripping off the joy I bring,

Listen instead of dissing lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)

And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain' strong,
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish we could never get the blues,
Wish I could bring back the people that died at E2

For 45 minutes when you hear the horn come down
And when she climbed in, I received a kiss and a hug
In a minute take off your shoes on a white persian rug
Wave your number rolling going to get bent
Why they sure call thugs mugging I see him right through the tent
He had the nerve enough to tap on my glass
But he ain't had enough light to peek in but I almost blast his ass
Is it cause that I'm known to bust
So quick to bump a bad bitch that y'all known to trust
So when you see me on them thangs in the cadillac truck
Man don't even know me when you see your bitch in the back or front
[Chorus - 2x]
[Verse 2: Todd Nitty]
Foul, god damn you hagging
Sixteen block my wall you want to block my magic
Now you wondering no what Nitty be doing
While these bitches trying to find out who am I screwing
And I'm so, sick and tired of the motherfucking gossip
And I'm, sick and tired of the motherfucking coppers
They actually post up at the end of my block
Take a hoe from her spot just for trying to plot
(*cop voice*)
[Todd Nitty]
And I'm like, damn friendly why you all on me
Man I'm out here slanging records shit I stopped selling weed
Tell me, are you mad cause you see what I drive
Or are you checking out these broads with the big ass thighs
It be my main bitch, getting on my last nerves
closest now to the edge from getting kicked to the curb
She got a homegirl, all up in her hair
Maybe they just meant my hair's longer than her's
[Chorus - 2x]
[Twista]
And I'm, sick of them haters that be all in my shit
Everytime I turn around somebody always be talking bout Twist
Want to know who got a baby by me, what does he drive, where my tip
Be all in my bidness because they heard that I've been bumping they chick
I ain't no lie, if I scoop your bitch up
I will, If I get scratch from her
Fold it up, if I tell her bend over
She won't get up, if I give up the bunch
What you need to know fo', you the player po-po
Steady beeking and poking paranoia smoking on too much doe-doe
Creeping all in my bid' no since I first splurged on a Rego
I got birds when I see you, I'm starting to think you work for them people
Hurt 'em when I tell 'em, I think you better ease up, cause everybody
Know you no G when it come to the money put some g's up
Until you hip lock and freeze up, you might as well
Turn around and go like the other way when I see you
[Chorus - 2x]
[High Beam]
See me riding real slick thick and rolling on thangs
Got the misses and the bitches wanna know my name
They want to know what I'm on
Get the fuck up out of mine homie go on and get your own
Riding slick with the cherry wood grain
In my big boy truck with the candy paint
Why, bitches giving me brain
I know you want to ball like me but you can't
Stay the fuck up out my business man

What happens when you combine the darkness with the light?
[Yungbuck]
I'm bringing pain like two bad nurses, and the pain from these here
motherfuckin verses ridiculous thirstses involving hearses
to the dirt shit first picks and use'n autos to work with
Slugs to the shirt shit (just to squirt shit)
A wicked hit with an expert kick
and burst 'til the earth split leave you hurt bitch
Show you how worser than worst get in the zone
See the vein when the pain repel
and then they closin the curtains bitch
(when adrenaline's pumpin')
I don't understand discussion, only hear certain shit
I'm a misunderstood nigga and I'm off my square high
Got me reversin clips and dispersin shit
[Twista]
What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
to make me wanna jump off of the edge
I'm charged off of suckers gettin shot up off the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
(so tell me what it said)
Retaliate with lethal repercussion
I feel the reefer rushin
to go into thangs, like it's a wicked stick
Took the Benadryl, hot like I'm fin' ta steal
to get the kickin shit
for niggaz and bitches that I kick it with
I was born to get you pumped up
it's like some lead bust cause I give motherfuckers a head rush
Then yo' head bust when you jumped up
Cause what I said must've got you geeked, my eyes red puffed
from smokin shit that niggaz hit on to die
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
And if you act a bitch on the side, if we have to
then the whole Westside'll let the shit go on and ride
when the trigga bust
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
That's your adrenaline rush
like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
to make his opposition chest kick up and jump
when you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
That's your adrenaline rush
like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
to make a trigger pick up and dump
so turn the bass, kick up and bump
and let the rhythm hit off the trunk
[Twista]
pullin up and bailin out like we're carsick, I'm ready to start shit
start up buryin some heads like an ostrich
and unload the whole cartridge and throw the shells out the garbage
the hardest of motherfuckers could never achieve what I've accomplished
Yungbuck's my accomplice
Located his existance with my sixth sense like a compass
and starting on a journey established to stop this
rushin up the hearts of the niggaz to get em charged
what's the real reason?
All you haters try to murder me so now it's kill season
And even though I'm still bleedin
I'm comin after you cause I'm still breathin
And y'all can't trace me
I bury my victims in the wall like gacey too lyrical
and since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
This music is miracle like I'm biblical
Killin like I'm nuttier than buddy love
and still wouldn't leave a bloody glove and start the truck up
and speed the fuck up getaway smokin this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin my viens I'm pumped up
[Yungbuck]
And I'm calibrated at 360 degrees
See that's 300 niggaz that gon die about 60 slugs to do this deed
(Psycho Drama) we too much for the industrialistic fuck
with this on the brink of fuckin up some shit
Dismantle deduct some shit
It's hard to imagine what niggaz got nerves to do
(what niggaz got nerves to do)
So I guess I'll just take that fuckin' nerve from you
then think what I'm on the verge to do
And I got the urge to ooh let semi close yo curtains fool
from killin the verses fool I be one of the worstest dude
(you the who?)
I'm the worstest workin about 9 millimeters above your surface
unleash these thangs then I defeat yo purpose bitch you hurtin
[Chorus]

Home of the brave and in god we trust
Im just a American gangsta, U.S hustla
Home of the brave and in god we trust
Im just a American gangsta
Chi-town bred
Cuz I gotta rep my city to the death
Annialate them till I dont see nothin left
Remember I spit it for the bitches
Now I'm spittin for the thugs
Hat cocked to the right
Hat cocked to the left
Brotha its a formal
Its a focus on ya chest
I spit it for the lords, and the for the folks and for the crips and for the bloods
Im like an american dream
Role to the green, with the souls and the breeds and the cobras a kings and the 2-16
Millimeter bullets from the niggas that
Tryin to do opposite.
They dont really wanna see how phyco I can get
I dont really see a mutha fucka stoppin this
Tryin to come at u and the apocalypse
.40 cal will have ya screamin, I dont wanna die
I am becomin nauseous with the fake thugs
So its love
To the real G's and all the boss's
To the niggas in the caller case
That got into it big
To get wut nobody gave us
We was born into this system, so dont be mad at what u made us.
Pull the pistol and cock it and bust in the sky
One time for the U.S, for turnin my niggas to gangstas cuz gettin money is what they do best.
Hard to fight like I ever did like Al Capone
Gangsta's is boss's,
K-town is the mutha fuckin hood, the Rock is the company, come and step into my office.

Forever see me in a lack
Got work but ya never see me in a pack
A mutha fucka said he never seen me with a strap
And I heard a mutha fucka say he dont see me in the hood.
Lil nigga I dont see u, cuz homie my hood is worldwide, and gettin money is wut we do.
Make ya knee joints lock when I freak u
Hit the 3 point shot like Hedo
Turkoglu up in the game
U killin the game like pac, nigga we point glocks like he do, see u.
No one will recognize I'm the maker of the Midwest
Im like for real?
Controversy in the middle....
I guess I'm like shaquille.
U can go on feel like ya feel
Nigga kno the hands I like to kill
But if u can hit me with the bangs
Lil cheap for shit, lets strike the deal
Got my phycos in the city rollin wit me
Always ready busta cap at the king like duuu.
I can bury ya bodies like an animal
Because I'm a cannibal, I eat a nigga like food.
Rippin thru ur flesh so I can devour the heart
Music is my playground, but if the rappin dont get you,
I hit this head with the back of the pistol until this bitch nigga lay down.
And no competition I had to be fuckin a twig?
Whoever comin for me gangsta, ima get it everytime I wanna get it. I'm living proof
Its a category F5.

The boy Twista
Holla
My life on the track (Okay)
Up and comin'

(Holla...Yeah)
It's the motherfuckin' Roc bitch, who hotter than us?
(Okay, okay)
[Young Chris]
Ayo..ever since a young buck, I been on the come up
Known to dish the raw, dish the law if they come up
And cheddar 'till the sun up..
If there's a ransom and the law get involved, then we never get it summed up
Never put ya gun up, if ya come round me
I go to war wit' niggaz 'round the corner from 'round me
You could front 'round me, but I read through that
Wit' the mili' and I ain't talkin' 'bout no Segal mac
Niggaz see shoot back, we can see to that
Hit yo front letters see through back, bring yo peoples back
And I used to grind out on my friend's spot
'til he's mom wanted my Tim-bots
Now my paint got me discounts
Or trans-quo all around the world, like I was signed to Pimp-dot
And if it's ten targets and I got ten shots
I'm tryin' to leave at least nine out of them ten shot..
[Memphis Bleek]
I got my mind on my money, money on mind
But some say its a gift, I don't write but I rhyme
I, complete songs with just one try
Tell 'em it's no lie, I beef all my life...dogg
I never think, it's already there
I find ways to say it, so you motherfuckers hear it
And when you hear it you feel it, you know its real so
This is how I live it, how it's pictured for real...nigga
I'm shittin' for real
Diamonds against wood, underground king for real
Big crib when I lay, yeah I'm livin' for real
Trust me the guns come off the shelf whenever shit'll get real
Automatics and extended clips, that's what I'm hittin' wit'
Dummies in the black rhinoes
Yeah, they be killin' shit
Masked up kidnap shit, that's how my niggaz get
Chi-town, NYC, that's how my niggaz get..
[Freeway]
Yes, just picture me rollin'
The smith and wesson'll stay goin' put a hole in yo chest
It's just, another hustle paper gettin' made and fold
Get mad, you street niggaz finally made it
I swoop five, he know the ride, heavily loaded
Deliver pies like cake, they go straight through yo payment...yup!
Chump...you don't really wanna war
With the State Prop clique, if ya clique shot us, squad up
S-P game so damn tough, the 4 4 in the 5th tucked ya'll can't hang
Transporter turned rapper, get a camcorder film my life
Still acclompished, tryin' to fill they cups
The rap version of Mandela, call my bluff
We still the street dwellers, feel my pain (my pain)
I spit a verse and split a clip in the rain
A fool-proof when the full force open you up (what!)
[Twista]
Twista will rock you, you don't want the thug apostle to pop you
Hostile when I drop you, turnin' everything colossal to fossiles
I speak street gospel, all they life I spit words and paint portraits
For real niggaz that hold down they fortress and serve off of porches
Hit 'em in the body wit' the powerful forces, that'll end all your doubt
Make you clean up your house, bag up an ounce, hit the dance floor and bounce
We blessed wit' the talent, fuck wit this clique, it ain't gon' be easy
'Cause you fuckin' wit' Twist if you fuck wit Chris, Bleek and Free-wheezy
So speak and breath easy... Or the scutches my future in 3D
I like wars, I'm from a city full of vice, lords, and GD's
Breeze and souls, 2-6's, kings, VD's and stores
Spanish cobras and all the true soldiers survivin' are gone
Watch me spit if for the killers and hustler's, flippin' all the pounds and bricks
Hate on me I'ma bust at you hoes, and I put eleven down wit' a clip
Niggaz servin' fiftys and hundreds, when I see you and I'm on yo tip

Ain't no hoes over here

From K-Town to the Manor, Holy City to the Wild Hundreds
The war is on, and all my killers is riding
Todd Nitty, what you got for these hoes (click...clock...blast)
[Todd Nitty]
I got that 9 double M glock, with the infrared beam dot
Aiming at your knot, making your heart stop
Yelling out ""Fuck Tha Po"" who some call it 5-0
Better look out for when they pull that kick door
Nothing but gangstas, thats all who I hang with
Slanging them thangs with, came up in the game with
The fucking hood rats, because them some broke hoes
Me get a rich bitch and stick her for her dough
The Manor in that K-Town, thats how we put it down
Letting off fifty rounds, thats how our shit sound
Artillery up the ass, scullies and ski masks
9's and bubble masks, gunning at your ass
Motherfucking street thugs, legit ballers
Money and the power, moving that flour
Taking no shorts and taking no losses
Hauling niggas asses off in coffins with that..

One, two, three, 45.'s,
Six, seven, eight, nine milli-meter
Ten, eleven, twelve gauge pump nigga [4x]

Who is it, the most left on nigga, they crept on nigga, with that teflon nigga
And it went BLOW! BLOW! body bag that bitch
Sent his ass to the morgue with the rest of them snitches
I heat 'em up like a motherfucking Newport
Left his ass with more holes than a golf course
What you thought boy, I'm from that 9th Ward
Where them stories are true about them Manor boys
How we leaving 'em, bleedin' and crawling on the ground
Like he's a dead nigga now
[hook]
I got that love for my nigga Twist, for aid and assistance
He told me holsters, caught him up in some bullshit
Don't even trips though, I'm heading in your route
Soon as I roll up, we puttin' they lights out
Poppin' a clip in, with one in the chamber

Finna' ride on a stranger, put the hoes life in danger

Started letting off hollows, straight through they car door
[Twista]
I'm a G from Chicago, pull the game weightless where I go
[Todd Nitty]
Bustin' pistols with laser injects, putting holes in they Avarex

Going straight through your tailored vests, now it's you or your neighbor next

Now we got your boy tied up, to the hideout we ride up

They gonna show us the stash-pot, with the little handles side up

back to school lets go back to school
lets go lets go back to school to the oldschool
[chorus 4x]
lets go back to school to the old school
to the times when the single file lines was the rule
to the days that we had to study all the maps
the days we were kiddin not to take the kid naps
the days when we used to have to wear the dunce caps
and the days when we used to bust the oldschool raps
sittin with your buddy studyin for ya test
lookin back so that you see up under betty's dress
couldnt wait for bells to ring so we can go to recess
to kick the battle rhymes just to see who was the best
there were seven emcee's in the 7th grade
i would kick seven rhymes had only seven made
but those seven rhymes we stole
note the way your toning
i gave the class a blast the way i smash my opponents
battlin was serious they've all ducked the fist
because i kick the funky fresh rhymes like fish
try to swing but they miss they miss like this
Rasheeda's on the monkey bars blowin me a kiss
throwin rhymes back and forth on the see saw
just to mess with him because i know that he saw
winkin at Latrice because i know that she saw
several suckas tried to push us down but we saw
these are the days when the tounge used to rule
recess is over lets go back to school
[chorus]
goin back to school like Rodney Dangerfield
to the lunchroom where the cooks arrange a meal
ate the sloppy joe where my friends copy so
we can try to get more than emcees can flow
the fun fun fun funky able fable
i stake the style standin on the stable lunch table
finish up the rhyme so i can pass it to the next
throw em back and forth till we heard the bells flex
left the lunchroom went to the gymnasium
ut time to flow we call it a rap stadium
throwin rhymes back and forth like a symphany
i wanna start a battle so step to him for me
the whylin got sensible because we saw the principal
like grammar school somehow the principal's invicible
shot a couple hoops the rims are called fruit loops
and if you miss we say opps and leave the gym like troops
single file line but we were still at the pool
the day is over tommorrow back to school
[chorus]
after school im home with my mom she's pleased
cuz rappin help me learn there were never F's and D's
cuz when im spellin bees it would help me stand these
didnt worry about freaks on the street sellin keys
rock the streets beats from the mouth no tracks
rhymes be simple bust on how they aint wack
i walk into a battle say what we havin here
back in them days i was called a cavalier
me and baby used to flow the flows like food
me and James Phillips used to rock the high schools
me and Carl Tolta used to rock the neighborhood
Don and Aviator used to show that they were good
me and Johnny Love used to rock the rock parties
and my brother Johnny kicks a dance to fade everybody
me and kingdom rock used to rock the south blocks
an empire of destruction had emcees on their jocks
the past i have stated, they way we used to rule
even though we graduated lets go back to school

Never wanna let you get up out the ride,

Lick a titty with them little bitty shorts you got on,
With the thigh's hangin' out tha' side,
When you work it you gone hurt these other bitches,
Hurtin' em' mean with the way you struttin',
Even though you only walkin',
You still lookin' like you shouldn't do that shit in public,

You ain't even gotta ask for the blunt,
Booty so phat, gaps so nice, you can see tha' ass from the front,
You fittina hurt 'em how you twurk that thang,
You want me to hear when you pop it baby,
Fell in love when you came up in club, with a whole bottle of Mo',

Sip a little somethin' while you bounce that ass,
Girl you gotta badunkadunk,

Now put that ass in Burberry for tha' Bently,
Now go on and put on a bikini for the Lamborghini,

Holla at me when you see me,
Now I don't wanna see nobody full of rigimortis,
Go head and jiggle for tha' more more money that's in his hands,
Go head and hit tha' shades with ya thick ass,
Now come over here by the table and give me a lap dance,
Bend it over come and get this dust,
Gota a playa thinkin that be bout to cut,
Gots to hit that from the back,
Shorty gotta' lil' junk in her trunk,
Look at how she make one butt-cheek freeze,
Look at how she make the other cheek move fast,
Look at how she switch, make the other cheek move,
Then move both sides then clap that ass,
Remember them times... When you met two shorty's
And you really want the cutie,
But you let her slide... 'Cuz the other gotta really big ol' donkey booty,
Now shorty think she fine, only if she really knew the truth,
I ain't gone lie, girl twurk them thigh's,

Baby you can never get rid of me and umm...
Twurk something... Oooh yeah...
Yeah that booty softer then a teddy bear,
So phat I can barely stare, with a darier, that's scary there,
Come and drop for a nigga named Twista,
Come and pop for me like a pistol,
Got badunkadunk's from a MOB and got badunkadunk's for Jazze Phizzle,
Girl you deserve respect, you look so good girl I commned you,
The hottest thang on the menu,
When I'm off up in the strip club, I like to get you,
Twurk that thang, bounce that ass,
Work it all the way down to the floor,
Climb to the top, shake it up-side down,
Side of the motherfuckin' floor,
Work that crown, give a lap dance,
Shake it like it's for lady-groups,
Take all the ballers to the V.I.P,
Girl gon' work yo badunkadunk,
[Chorus]

Shake That Thang Girl [Repeat to the end of song]

Funny you could wrap it like a mummy with a honey
And I'll make the people love me while they hug me with they money
And I'm always in a hurry just to come and cook it curry
Or bake, MORE CAKE, shinin like the day was sunny
And I knew the Lord love me, bless and bestow all upon me
While I embellish all in it, that's the basis of the story
Pardon all of my aggressions, still get it in a recession
And I got the antedote, you could pay me for the confession
And it's money in the air, hope you niggaz fill it up in here
YOU GOT IT? Let me show you how to be a billionaire
Chorus
Steppin in the spot, GMG is the team
We don't know about y'all but we stack our cream
Haters everywhere, we don't really care
When they be talkin that shit over here you know we don't play fair

Money money money is the root of all worlds
Never let it make you, make that money

if you got something to stress then get it off your chest and
we can take it to the middle bitch
and go on get it on and I bet you that the outcome is that I'm leavin
niggas out done, cut up
but its odd to see a motherfucker outrun just because he let his
mouth run so shut up
and sit back if you know whats good for you I can still overthrow you
I dont give a fuck about the fact that the hood know you
dont make a nigga have to show you
that Ima die before you make an ass of me stop as if you took a blast
at me and cause tragedy
that was how it was that was how it is and thats the way it has to be
[chorus 2x]
[verse 3]
its like uh, ah, sit back and let the shit just straight marinate
I pull the stage curtain back like norman bates
performin hates smokin on some reefer performin fate
its a constant struggle for us white boys with the shit hittin licks
in the scuffle for us
my nigga lucky made him bleed fear is if to proceed to bust
if he a different type of breed from us
so yall petty niggas need to hush; two straight to you brain means pains
inflicted
even if it aint things to taunt pain like rage till my brain is wicked
aint even lived out a quarter of your lifetime tryin to push product
and aint servin the right kind and aint strivin the right rhymes
but Ima shorten your lifeline
through the pipeline I vocal cold bust em plus them with killers
jaw stealers throw dealers rushin parties bloody body chillers
pretty casket fillers
cuz those niggas got they shit together
we come pay to Creator's Way and dont gotta be but then again whatever

Life, pain
[Hook]
It's so hard to survive in this world of pain
I feel like I'm goin' crazy so
I'ma shell my brain
My niggaz out here droppin' off over rocks and thangs
Mama never told me life was such a dirty game
[Lifty Stokes]
I hold my glock to my chest, yes my steel is cold
I pray to God to come to rescue me and save my soul
I reminisce on my past life
Ever since I was a young shorty I didn't act right
Live for the street life
Yellin', ""What it be like?""
Nigga we Folks
Money makin' hustlaz from the Westside and it shows
In these past years, shit it's been a hell of 25
Back in '91, I didn't even think I'd be alive
I was sellin' jewelry to rocks, and rocks to weed
Off at the comfort zone G with a fifth of T's and B's
Ready to do whatever, young with a pocket full of cheddar
No thoughts of stackin' just ballin', picture me fallin' nigga never
In this lifetime
But I had to grieve for awhile
Cause a nigga fell off hard but I got my ass back on the grind
And hit the streets like a mad man, goin' against the grain
With dried tears on my face from the pain of this dirty game
[Hook 2x's]
[Todd Nitty]
Fresh out the pen and can't maintain
Wanna go and hit the block, be on the same thang
Tryin' to serve some cain up in this dirty game
Cause you did a lil' bit, think ain't shit changed
You wrong boy, these shorties out here misled
You fuck around and catch a bullet in yo forehead
Ya heard me?
This ain't the 80's where you get a nickel sack and a hoodrat
A 40-ounce of Red Bull and blow yo wig back
Nigga fuck that, this the year 2-G
Where the toughest muthafucka get left 6-feet deep
So don't sleep, cause the scariest nigga'll pull the trigga
Put 2 in 300 pounds, so that makes you a killa
Oh really, could you be that silly
To think you gon' take over a block where I be ?? nigga forget it
Don't make me have to blow yo brains
In this fucked up world, this fucked up life, this fucked up game
[Hook 2x's]
[Twista]
Hey nug, for some reason at night I can't sleep
When I lay down, I keep tossin' and turnin'
There's somethin' wrong but I don't know what's wrong with me
Eyes burnin'
Cause sometimes I burst into tears when ain't nobody home with me
Stress from thoughts of survival just rushed my dome quickly
Y'all better come on get me
Cause I bout to do somethin' so muthafuckin' drastic
Instead of writin' essays like grabbin' SK's
With one of the best ways that I know to feed my family
Cause y'all ain't foolin' me
Y'all people plannin' a way for my people to read my eulogy
I see what y'all bogus ass doin', y'all plannin' on hurtin' me
Used to be crucifyin' or burnin' me
Now you eliminatin' paper currency
Terrorizin' with technology
And that Y2K shit, I don't know why you play with the chosen guys
The wool ain't no longer pulled over my eyes
Gots to get some scratch and I gotta get it soon
We about to be doomed
Do somethin' for the kids before I go to my tomb
Gotta bust this thang and maybe then thangs gon' change
Tryin' to check mine, cause all of it on y'all I can't blame
Maintain, it's a strange game
At times you gotta throw blows for the gold
It's a long road, some of us do shit despite losin' our soul
Got cold flows but it's strange, I still can't get no change
Bout to be insane
Tryin' to pay the bills but still straight causin' pain
It's a dirty game
[Hook 2x's]
Dirty - dirty - dirty game
Dirty game
Such a dirty game

Huh
Yea baby girl, you know how it's going down
2003, Do or Die, J.P., Twista still
[Verse 1]
Well, when I heard a knock at the door
Must of been the girl that I met on the lo
She real thick, nice shape 5-4
Had a few here so we head to the show
Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
Yes stay click, in the Expo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Damn natural, never walk from the store
Gimmie a minute, and get down with a pro
P. I. M. P. P. O. get a few friend like a party fa sho
We can hit a tune like my homie Debo
All in the mall buying Avirex, we can sport mine called S.E.X
Platinum link, all in effect
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
P.L.A.Y.E.R., giving her eyes
Then we head to the bar
Never give her money, cuz she know she a star
Did you wanna ride in my car?
[Hook]
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
23's like Jordan on the Escalade
Got a pound of dro' girl, if you wanna blaze
You can let your hair down, while the AC blow
Before you get in, I just need to know
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
I'll keep it on the low
Do you? Do you?
[Verse 2]
In the mood, like yes y'all
Rather be, let it test y'all
Light the B if it's special
Can I undress to relax y'all
Well, stretch out like a Lex ball
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
Let me touch it, if it's that soft
And relieving in the menopause
I can't believe how they sent them off
Took the number then I'm in the mall
Being grinning bout to spend them all
Just balling, shot shot calling
Holla at my dogg while they sipping alcohol
Really want to kick it, but they all just stalling
6 dime pieces, checking out my pausing
They looking like ooh, he flossing
Baby girl, I don't do this often
In the 5 double 0 for sho'
We still ride the Cadillac, slam the doors
Suppose I kick back, keep the flows
Dressed to impress, then flex the ho
Check the dough
Do you? (Do you? Do you Do you?)
I'll keep it on the lo
Do you? Do you?
Do you?
An it really don't matter, where we go
Let's sip this Henny, pop this Mo
Before I strip you, I just need to know
Can I do you?
[Verse 3: Twista]
Now I was kicking, when I met you in the club
Had me feeling on your booty, and the brother was a 50ball
For you, I even popped some Crissy in the tub
And my body was start wondering when if I'm a get the draws
Let me know if I'm in the right lane
Tell me when I say the right things
I got tight flame
Rollin thru stunting why are you running
Cuz I'm coming with some pimp-type game
Iced out charm, chromed out truck
Coming thru balling like I don't really give a fuck
Blowing the fatty, an purple, with the windows up
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me, backing me
To a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb.............
Hold it in, then blow it out
Do you like the way I flow it out
Don't ever act funny or petty with the money
When I throw it out
Do you like how I talk
Do you like the way I ride
Do you like the way I pimp spree's
You can let me down easy
Cuz' still ill be the player Twista slash be a P.I.M.P
Now baby, do u?

putting niggas in shops ready for a box
made my getaway slick as a fox
taking the ditches the cops
escaping visions of prisons and locks
my mission don't stop no pot to piss in so the plot thickens
I keep hearing gats clicking
see I'm into strange places
wear a mask to cover up they faces if they want me why they procrastinate
is it just in oasis?
perpetrated by my imagination
apple texas trojan am I tasting
my own death gun fire got me toned deaf
so I say a silent but I save my ownself
can you clone death?
like they do life I see the blue light hearing the sirens
amongst the madness and the violence gun firing
tragedies of lying in to I want a murderous round boy
that let niggas don't talk infa-red triggers caulk
a nigga trying to cheat life
now death says name affiliation in the street life
I see nights away from the mics
far from the henny and ice where many ya like for the riches and life
while shaking the device with a camera device like dice
from pistol fights nickel hypes murder and mics is life
in the Chi and Suge Knight
so think twice or faces vicious types in pit fights
[chorus]
the blocks hotted the cops watching for anything unusual happen
they been stoping profits three days in tracking
drug traffic distracting clientele with drug habits
load them thangs and make them slugs happen
enemies of surprise got em frantic
scattered and panicked damaged by any 11
ducked behind a treasure box let em have it
managed to get away hide away your weapons
probably still there but they ain't telling
belling to the bank for my safe deposit
gotta take my grub on these narcotics properly watching
with a copy of my face composite
description all the way down to the J's I'm rocking
laser dots and the ducking police dogs hunting
resistin everything I'm touching
blood running down from the barbwire bloodening
choppers hovering sirens coming closer
grab our toaster, I'm supposed to surrender
but I done heard the shots from the trigger of a

Put you in a crib and give you plenty green
To help you fulfill all your childhood dreams
Only for your love I fiend

Got me head over heals, so tell me what's the deal, baby

And I ain't gon' never be satisfied

To add a little spice, cookin' nigga steak and rice

Walkin' down the aisle, havin' our first child
Plus our marriage worth while
With a brand new lifestyle, I could walk that mile
But baby I need you right now
In my arms caressin' me
I can see your eyes undressing me
Girl it's destiny and love is the recipe
But this way's got the best of me
On everything, I can guarantee you better things
If you just get rid of ""what's his name""
And let me in your world
So I can show you, baby, that my love is real and not a game
So can a brother come through
So I can show you, boo, just exactly what I mean
It don't matter if you fuck me tonight or next month

Don't feel the heatseaker 'cause we gon' be smokin' on sweet cheeba
Take my boo to the mall and go shopping until we fall

[Intro]
This is for my ladies,
Sexy like champagne Glass,
You what I'm talking about,
A reflection of a Pena Colada,
Listen up?
[Verse 1]
I know you heard the terms chicks are like cars,
Well I treat bitches like drinks,
When I step in the club and by out tha bar,
So let me quench my thirst wit you and a friend
Instead of the juice and gin,
Why don't I pour out the drink and you hop in,
Glass full of ass for a true mutha fucka,
Wit that that turquoise Coogi on,
You remind me of a blue mutha fucka,
Your friend was sexy when I seen her in prada,
But I think Gina was hotta,
Cause her skin tone was like a Pina colada,
I saw two Japanese chicks that got bodies,
So I ordered them a mi tia and hot saki,
Then I got cocky,
And asked them do they come to this club a lot,
Well ya got a brotha hot,
Hop in my bubble drop,
Can I get a double shot?
Or get wit these two mamacita one wit the karma of margarita,
The other one like two shots of tequila,
And they all fine I really don't know what to think,
As I get bubble and choose and try to figure out,
[Chorus]
What's my favorite drink,
Girl can I sip on you,
Sip on, [4x]
What's my favorite drink,
[Verse 2]
Know not to bring no Cosmopolitan asses,
I like the one that makes your face drop like a Neapolitan masta,
No telling what these thick bitches would do,
Reminiscent of a big old picture of Bo,
But hit cha like a slow screw,
Dip in a strip a club in LA wit a bankroll,
Where the weather aint cold,
So I can see some hoes slide down a poll,
I met two dancers named Moet and crystal,
I was checkin they style,
We had a session It was wet it was wild,
Then I dug these two twins thick wit Hennessey one was Remy Red,
Wit skinny legs,
Both of them game to give me head,
Wit a little bit absolute vodka fo they homie Tasha,
Tell her to come closa,
So yall three can give me a Sammy Sosa,
If I was mayor I would campaign ass,
Politician wit women swimming around the champagne glass,
Drunk so much I might earl in the sink,
And if you ask me why,
I couldn't figure out,
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
If you would suck my soul,
I shall lick your funky emotions,
Look at that big old donkey you toting,
I wish I could pour some of you in a bishop cup,
And have a toast wit King Boo,
And celebrating the fact that you thick as fuck,
I holla Church cause its pimps in tha party,
Let me sip on ya body,
Get a good buzz of ya like you lemon Bacardi,
Or a long Island havin sex on da beach,
Or in tha Llac sunroof let back wit a tech on tha seat,
Got a red bone I call her strawberry Daiquiri,
Bring her back fo may,
Carry packs fo may,
Had her suck off my facultay,
Got a little mamma name Mimi,
Who remind me of martini and Asti spamanti,
How she move to my cd,
I got a chocolate chick who deep throat,
She help me shake up dope,
She the complexion of Crown Royal and Coke,
And they making it hard for me to decipher and think,
As I get bubbly and choose,
And try to figure out,
[Chorus]
[Highbeam]
Hennesy mixed wit some of that Alize,
Gimme a shot of that remy,
and a whole lot of tanguray,
keep it comin wit that cognac,
pop tha moet lets sip on that,
naw playa put ya money back,
cause these drinks on me,
give me a bottle of that belve,
long island ice tea,
hook me up a apple martini,
all these dinks on me,
I want to have a sex on the beach,
How about a gin and juice for me,
So put away ya money G,
All these drinks on me,

Well a motherfucker could never control me, only squeeze me and hold me
That's what the hoe came up and told me
Now is she bold G? But in my mouth is where the gold be
Cause I be pimpin her like Goldie
Gotta get paid in this age my fingers ain't made
just to be choppin up confetti with, if it's already thick
you better study nigga if you ain't with it you can get it
cause I ain't even on that petty shit
So who the fuck do I competi with?
The rhythm I kick, is like a rhythmly-wicked-arith-a-metic
Pick em up quick and then give em the dick, thinkin I'm innocent
They up in the mall shoppin for me pickin a fit
I got them heffer's nose red
and when we get in the bed, I be leavin em with rose legs
Stuffin that made em wanna pose dead
but you already got em until you get up in them hoes head
I don't mean to sound bogus or nothin
but it's the bomb when I be havin them cuties thinkin
I'm in love with em, when I'm rubbin em
Be gettin pub with em, in a club with em
Smokin dub with em, huggin em, freakin in the tub with em
After gettin paid from her she ain't trippin
cause she know she got what she paid for
She honor my name, I gotta tame, here it go
Now we speakin with the game on ways to make mo'

[Johnny P in background:] let me playyyyy, with your emotions
(Let me play with your) emotions hoe
To the rhythm of a hi-hat, take a puff and lie back
Let me stimulate your mind, body and soul, I know you want to try that
Now motherfucker can you buy that...
Tell me baby can you buy that
I got you under my complete control, you know it's worth more than
diamonds and gold, now don't be bogus and deny that
[Verse Two: Twista]
Now how the fuck you gon' act hoe, I saw you creepin out the back do'
What you runnin from a mack fo'? Lay you on your back slow
cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like a afroCome and take a glimpse of the stairs
it's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I betcha notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow dis, cause my eyes be the lowest
if you didn't notice then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin women under my spell, like I'm up in their brain
pumpin their vein with game for the anatomy that's feminine
They're fillin em up with adrenaline, got em geekin
we're speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission is surrenderin, it ain't no endin if it's on
with a blunt from the bomb side
In the right place, with the right mind and the right line
you can get a lifetime contract
They be wise until they look into your eyes
a shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib, lay low, hit her off from behind
then she signed on the dotted-line, the hoe was like
""Oooohh Daddy... why you doin me like this?
I'd do anything to be with you, you got me gone in the head""
Ya mind, I don't mean to make a disaster up
like my Dad to master love
But if a motherfucker breakin you for every penny you earn
then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess it's cause I'm cold, shit
Thought you was gon' be spendin me I betcha think you sho' did
but game recognize game, now you lame in the brain
Stupid bitch that's what you get for tryin to gold dig, now
[Chorus]
Yeah, this be Hype, the Verbal Tantrum
Kickin it with my man Twista
If you should suck my soul
I should make your funky emotions
Nothin is good unless you play with it
Play with me baby
[Verse Three: Twista]
I know you think it's blasphemy
but won't you give up when she ask for me? After he passed the beat
Since you said I was your Magesty, I had to see
and when you get paid, there is some cash for me, is it a tragedy
that I can get her so gone, the hoe be trippin talkin up her love a lot
But the only love I got, is when I'm grippin like I wanna hug the Glock
or when I rub the twat, or pickin up a dub at spots
Fuck the hoe thugs, the clubs, and the phony perpetrators with dimes
The speed knots match voo-Do or Die, Psycho Drama, Crucial Conflict
Be pimpin with em gators and dons, collect the papers and dolls
Player haters remarks will get smoked to a blunt dust
Sso keep walkin the next time you hear grown folks talkin
motherfuckers betta shut the fuck up, cause we make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin while we be gamin like Don Juan
What up the filet minion, the grey poupon
them hoes are staked to charm, because we make the bomb
Now I don't mean no harm, but either come on in or get on gone
and let me pull my pouch of snuff
In between your thighs, come take a pull and vibe
and let your tongue go coastin low, now

[Johnny P]
I can get inside your head
all day everyday, and play with your emotions..
Let me get inside your head
all day, everyday, and play with your emotions..
[Twista over P in background]
Huh.. yeah it's Twista again y'know
These females be trippin me out y'know?
Certain stuff they be sayin
Like this other female she came up to me
(This other female she came up to me)
She said a little somethin like this
(She said a little somethin like this)
[Twista]
I thought you love me though? Now how you gonna be wrong
just cuz you know you got me gone in the head?
You be twistin with the lovely flow, but whatchu actin all ugly fo'?
Left me alone in the bed
Where you goin cause I'm not done, cool til you got some
Trippin when I got sprung, but you ain't fly love
You da shit but your petty money can't but love
Is that what I does? My reply was, you know why cuz
I could tell you was prone-to-bone niggaz I hang around
But the reefer I was zonin on, make me the one you freakin on da mo'
from how I lay you down
Now you trippin cause I'm not attached, hangin with a lot of rats
Her concerned whether I'ma act
Now you the momma mack, comin back with a lot of scratch
Go on witcha bad ass, but I gotta catch
I done peeped the way you look into my nigga's eyes
I done recognized that I won't be hypnotized
Criticized, no more inner cries, now I'm ener-gized
with my eyes on the prize just a flick of thighs
I can't let nobody ride with me that'll lie to me
Smokin stanky up and play with me the way you do
And you trippin cause I played you too? Sho' you right
Take the whole thing in stride like the way I do
and let me play with your emotions slow
[Chorus: Johnny P, Twista]
I can get inside you head
All day, everyday, and play with your emotions
[T] Let me play with your emotions slow
to the rhythm of a kick-drum, take a body get sprung
Let me stimulate your mind, body, and soul
You know I got a quick tongue, so if you want some get some
Let me get inside your head
Everyday, all day, and play with your emotions
[T] Let me play with your emotions slow
to the rhythm of a kick-drum, take a body get sprung
Let me stimulate your mind, body, and soul
You know I got a quick tongue, so if you want some get some
[Twista]
Now tell me how you gon' act though? I saw you creepin out the backdo'
Whatchu run up on my mack fo'?
Lay you on your back slow cause you know I got you with my lasso
Blow your mind like an afro
Come and take a glimpse of the stairs
It's the aroma of a pimp in the air, I bet you notice the smell
It's like a lotus when I flow this, cause my eyes be the lowest
If you didn't notice, then you bogus as hell
I'm puttin woman under my spell, lock them up in the brain
Pimpin her vain with games with the anatomy that's feminine
Then fillin them up ""Adrenaline""
Got 'em geekin we're speakin approachin up a pimp like a gentleman
Submission and surrenderin and ain't no end in it
if it's on with a blunt from my bomb sack
In the right place with the right mind and the right line
you can get a lifetime contract
Then be wise until I look into your eyes
Now shorty freaked when she spotted mine
Took her over to my crib laid low hit it raw from behind
then she signed on the dotted line, and she was like..
(Ooh daddy.. don't make me feel like this..
I don't want nobody else, you got the bomb!)
Your mind I don't mean to make a disaster of
like when daddy mastered love
But if a bogus brother breakin you for every penny you earn
then how could you still show the bastard love?
I guess I'm with a cold clique
Thought you was gon' be spendin me? I bet you think you sho' did
But game recognize game now you lame in the brain stupid trick
That's what you get for tryin to gold-dig
Now let me play with your emotions slow
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Whassup girl? It's the Twista and the Verbal Tantrum once again
with a sack big enough for me and a friend
You do know how to roll B's don't you?
Well let's fill one up with a dub and a little bit of love
And take it to the head
for some of this long-lastin blunt passion
[Twista]
I know you think it's blasphemy
but won't you show my boys and pass for me, after he past the B?
Since you said I was your majesty, I had to see
and when you get paid then push some cash to me
Is it a tragedy, that I can get her so gone
that she be trippin talkin up ""I love a lot""
But the only love I got, is when I grip a mic
or when I hug the glock or when I rub the twat
I'm pickin up a dub in spots, skip the studs in the clubs
and the phony perpetrators with jobs
The Speedknot, Psycho Drama shocked the world
Triple Dark, there's a Conflict, be pimpin 'em with gators n darts
Collectin papers n gobs
Playa haters remarks'll get smoked to a blunt dust
So keep walkin and next time you hear grown folks talkin
other people better shut the (fuck) up
Cause I make the women suck up
You insist to be trippin when we be gamin like Don Juan
Without the filet mignon and Grey Poupon
The thieves just ain't the charm because I made the bomb?
Now I don't mean no harm; but either come on in or get on gone
Now watch me live a kosher flow
In between your thighs come take a pull and divide
but let your tongue go coastin low
Now let me play with your emotions slow
[Chorus]

Rockin and me stylin, rockin and me stylin, wildin

Loco, a lyrical thing I sling and cling like Sing-Sing, merciless like Ming
Watch me come and stiff in em like a photo

Flowin a hyper type of song that I sung from the lung
Breakin em up in a snap, I think that I better thank Allah

Face the lyrical rhythm of this lick I throw in a blister of a body
Breakin em up so quick that I can even bruise hair

Don't wanna come in the door but when you're hearin this
Do I hear a 'knock-knock who's there'?

I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like ""Dick her""
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
I remember wakin up at the flat fucked up in the back
Checkin on my weed and scratch I damn near fell out the lat
I hit the sack to sleep it off woke up woozy and still smoking
Twista's wishes thinking about last night and the bitch that was scopin
Fuck it lets get 'em on I grabbed the phone ""Girl call your friends""
Then I hit Twista and Maze and them bout the bitch in the Benz
Nigga push only cause I see them already been in the block
You know the lit niggas you'll find us in my favorite spot
And that's on

In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning B
Sippin on the duce duce OZ
And I be killin me how many thick fees I see
Getting bubbly waitin for Stokes and T, I spit a little game at three
Tryin to talk up on the shoppin spree
Or a B of that stinky green free
Straight getting, to puff puff pass
and drive up my gas hittin all the hot blocks
Bumpin ""Legit Ballers"" to ""Rock Y'all Spot""
Everybody know the shit 'bout to drop
See from Northbound to Ten Row in it go tryin to get they props
Pollutin the air wit squares, blunts, and tops
Settin up shops for lots comin back nots
Each and everyday of the week
the Mobsta Elites be on somebody porch dumpin heat
Bustin flows in the cipher getting deep
While we cheat something sweet to Legendary beats
'Till we reached our peak
Scummy aloud attractin crowds to the street
Then it's time to retreat grab something to eat
And head to the late front to get up wit some freaks
Wit a treat under the seat
For the cats who get the sudden urge and wanna try to jack
Cause when your pockets is fat
It seems like all the haters and hood-rats want to attack
And when the park close we hit the liquor store
for a box of Sitches and a fifth of Yak
South on the corner and get a few sacks
Or betta yet the whole pack so we can get back

One morning I
Woke up next to a choclate fee and a red bone
My dick was hard I started stroking and poking
After toppin I tell them to role the blunt
Cause on the front I hear them niggas steady smoking and jokin
I heard it's gonna be hot outside gotta get up and lay my clothes out
It's gonna be too many hoes out
Before my ladies rolled out I got 'em to clean up the whole house
Then I threw my fit on look in the mirror get on gone
""Nigga you looking dope because you got a knot""
Ain't no cruising up out the hop
I'm hangin by the spot cause I had to put the Lexus off up in the shop
But it's all to good it's a hood thang
Never too bogus notice the love on the block that nigga coolin
Aiming the radio out the window steady grooving
Tip by the corner store wit the indo steady movin
Niggas who flippin new 98's is steady cruising
Bumpin up the block flossin for the chicks cause they rich
But I ain't leavin off the front with the blunt
Set a switch just to pull in all the thickest btiches
At the crib I can't get caught wit heat
If it's some static I shall chalk and sweep
I go and get the B's up off but chief
""Come get me if the phone for me I'm at the party across the street""
I'm enjoying the breeze high degreez and no ease
Pockets be full of G's smoking B's hiding the fees
Making no enemies the po P's yellin out ""Freeze""
Serving niggas wit ease staking cheese so nigga please
Tell me 'bout some ghetto love
Homies around smoking Newports 'till the brew drunk short
You can travel the world can't find a place like home
With a crib on the front with a skunk torch

A lethal legacy was born,
Ask any rapper around
Bout the fuckin mics I left torn
But the game won't give me all my P's
And I wont leave the chi to get G's
Got love for my mc's at home
But some of them still hate on me
Look how many years I done repped
Hustle thru the streets in the Go
Inspired by the first rappers ever
Signed a contract a decade ago
Put chi name on records in the east
Put chi name on records in the south
Put chi name on records in the west
Bitch how you gone open yo mouth
To the mutha fuckin industry
Why you hate on me and my city
Will it be an imbalance of power if yall let chi niggas get G's
Or I it us holdin us back
Think hard when you rollin yo sack
Whatever the case my chi nigga
If it's in my means I got yo back
What the fucks really going on
Does a man bite cause he knows he on
Don't he know I 'v already established myself as Twista Coleone
Well I'm holdin my city down
Aint going nowhere here I stand
You know where I'm at if you hate me
If you want me
Here I am

Tried to kick me to the curb
To the back
To the ditch
To the dump
To the shack
But I sprint
To the front
In a llac
With a fifth and a blunt
And I'm back
In the bitch wit a pump
And I'm ready to bust at you hoes
Ready to dump lames in ditches
Steady makin fakers bleed
LB family handle business
Come and enter Twista's realm
Journey wit me thru the pain
The hurt just might make you envision drama that can turn you insane
How much of my chaos bring tears
How many threaten my career
How many threatin to murder me but bitch you know where I live
Who the fuck you think I is
Yall aint comin at no lil shawty
Why you think you can hurt like these years
Joe why my lil P's got you salty
Think you finna bring out my fears
Tell me why my success
Make you cry and why my downfalls make you laugh
I bet my hydro got you high
Never let hate back me down
Stand firm like a man
If you want me
Wanna kill me
Here I am
[CHORUS]
[Verse 3]
We got geo like neo and of course we as saucy as Morpheus
Or we as sick as sir Marcus aralias alias atheist
Against niggas who flow be the achiest
Against a aliens and why they hate me is maybe is cause I'm controlling this radius
Of this world and this whole universe
Don't believe let me spit you a verse
And just when you think you the worst
I come wit words that make you disperse
My allies know I'm too cold
My enemies know I spit fast
My lords know I 'll bust that thang
My gangsta's know I'll whoop some ass
Mobster family steady ride
LB family steady click
When us and other crews collide
Choose ya weapon take a pick
Load up
Click clack
It's on finna bust, get back
Run home come at me bogus get whacked wit a strap
To the back, of the dome
Industry niggas get gone
Heard yall be speakin big words
I'll show you some shit that a blow you down
Slow you down
Like you sip syrup
For chi sacrificial lamb
Right here I stand firm
If you want me
Here I am
[Chorus]

Check this out ya dig?

And I got the whole Legit Ballers family up in hea nigga
A yo Beanie Franks
You the early bird of this muthafucka
GUNNIN!!
[Beanie Franks]
Picture a niggas thats raw
Amber fire his ass and what we'll say is what we saw
Muthafuckas I slaughter
Blow 'em out the water
L-E-G-I-T that's Ballers
My styles as lethal
As a bitch that's found with AIDS gettin loose
Nigga before you get spraid wit some hot shit
While you run I pop shit
Yo ghetto aint no harder than mine, fuck that block shit
You cant manage them thangs
The robber takin and born in the range
Battle the match and bang
I hold my gun up high screamin ""Fuck 'Em All""
Then I get in that as like cholesterol
I got the game lock dowm like Alcatraz
And if you escape you betta haul ass
Cause when I catch ya physically and mentally
I bring yo ass on the block thats the penalty
Put 'em in the hot seat grab a hoe
I'll show you some shit that'll make your eyes explode out ya skull
Cause bein odd ont the block is a N-O
Niggas didnt know that I could go off, and show off, and throw off the law
Turn, send ten shows that'll burn
Whats left is a muthafuckin dent in the alley
Beanie Franks is the shit on the Grand Finale
[Toxic]
Yeah
Thats tha shit I'm talkin about nigga
Now its time for Turtle Banks to spit
[Turtle Banks]
Turtle Banks
You know its my turn to buss
And make weak muthafuckas turn to dust
And if you weak you die in the streets of Chi
Its deep drive by my bullets fly in the seat
Them niggas aint ballin mufuckas fakin
Scared of facin Legit Ballers at ya crib waitin
And now you shakin
Call the guys to come chase me
I make them punk muthafuckas buckle up for safety
A bitch, a pickle, a chicken, a clique, niggas is sick
For they skits and they scurges
Now I'm pimpin the pain cause I'm urgin
And rearrangin your muthafuckin face like a surgeon
Lyrics layin wit a four thats what I be fuck settin every peace
My shit to yo ass I see
O, for my mob status I'ma lay low
Representin Legit Ballers and niggas biten the flow
On the streets or the stage
A 45 or a gauge
Thats why me and the Twista always hittin the front page
For what? cause we so damn cold
And when we enter the car niggas cluthcin they hoes
So fuck it, fall wit dust and get snatched
While Nitty bustes the facts in the Grand Finale
[Toxic]
Yeah 'lil nigga its been once for you bitches
Y'all cant touch Legit Ballers
And just when you thought it was over
T-Nitty in here doin danger
[T-Nitty]
The names Nitty, you know I'm comin off like a gangsta
Disrespectin the mob I gotta bang ya
An everyday, cituation when I was caught by
Fuck a car, I do a muthafuckin walk by
When the G to the A-M-E
Leavin whole fuckin familys greivin
Cause if I miss some I gotta burn ya
Then I'm aressted (For what?) attempt murda
Never out done only out doin
Fuckin them bitches and then I leave 'em boo-hooin
Why?, cause they addicted, to what the dick did
The pleasure and pain the wing ding inflicted
Given niggas two to the head
Boy you can't mess wit a mad and hard head
Fool, I'm a straight low neva broke
Cause today I be a balla, shot shot caller
I dont give a fuck about one
Them hoes aint even got love and they boo-hooin
Now when I take it pass rap
While I'm still gang bangin bitch nigga catch a cap
Not easy but my nine easy to kill wit
Especially if you poppin bullshit
The N only I to the T
Especially my dogs on the muthafuckin Grand Finale
[Toxic]
Yeah that shit was bangin
Last but not least Twista up in hea
The orignator of the style all y'all niggas been biten
And to show you how its done
GUNNIN!
[Twista]
Swingin, singin my raw was through rap
To the rythm c-cock back T-O is in the back
So if it makes you giggle I figure you thinks its petty
But to me its kinda Tilly
(Tell 'em what) I'm makin fetty
Trippin off the man tho we buzzin while I'm thuggin
Get drunk and discustin the way I be bustin pistols and hustlin
Dont take second for me to pop off my nine
Cause I'm the tiggy-tiggy Twista nigga what have been on out of the pick
But I was harder T-W-I-S-T-A to the formula
Its cold cause we been smokin on dro
So nigga when you take a listen
You wonder who I'm dissin
D-O-N-T L-E-A-V-E without permission
The ""Baller-T"" aka ""The Swisher Roller""
""The Bigger Gun Holder"" so I be damned when a nigga role up
Ever compete wit Mobster Elites
Much Less beef
Its like you comin on my tip wit no heat
Never smile when the Twistas in the club
Cause I got a mask and gloves
And I might be bustin out slugs
I'm comin raw cause I'm smokin on kali
Gang bangin wit Mobsta Elites on the muthafuckin Grand Finale
[Toxic] & Twista

[Chorus 3x's]
He lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay, he lay
In the grave he lay, he lay
In the grave he lay, he lay, he lay
[Sko]
L-E-G-I-T Ballaz
Screamin' stop killin' for dollars
From G-I, from the South to the Westside
From the D-I and where I love, Darkside
I forever got my pride
Forever guide my guys to a better mindstate or phase
To replace all the wicked ideas erased
All the fears about the payroll
What you say Lo about Sko
We representin' the Chi, do or die for real
Niggaz caps gettin' twist off they tops for real
The conflict's in the hearts of many men for real
The convicts in the Pen holdin' plenty steel
Niggaz know they house bigger but they play in the field
Tabasco ain't gon' let it ride though
Let my brother fat folk
I thrill for the kill
Smoke me a ?
Never runnin' from the mill boy I'm runnin' the field
It's the eternal Lord feel cemeteries revealed
Prophecies prophetcized stuff bein' fulfilled
And to another man I'll never kneel
Until I see Allah, fate's comin' from the wheel
And baby girl, you can check it you can dig it here
If yo nigga try to test it, you can bet it he'll
Be in a grave he lay, he lay
In the grave he lay, he lay, he lay
[Chorus 2x's]
[Liffy Stokes]
It's Liffy Stokes with the sticky smoke
Quick to shoot a muthafucka down if he choke
Never see me in yo city broke
In the club spendin' 50 notes
Leave with 50 girls and 50 Folks
And we all tote scopes
Guarded like the Pope cause we got that bomb on the dope
G-stacks in our coat
Niggaz ask, we ain't hoes
Just to afloat with me, I'm livin' lovely
Baby come on and relax with a Folk
All my mackateers know why we ride down
Cliqued-up pick the bitch up bumpin' sounds, hurtin' the whole town
With raw pound all around me ya dig, the sounds off like a live round
22's on Fleet, peep my shine now
I got a whole fuckin' nation that'll ride out
And put yo lights out in a matter of minutes young nigga
So it's best for you to be closin' yo fuckin' mouth
Before I pull out and bust slugs in yo ass
You lucky yo bitch here, that's why I'm givin' you a pass
Nigga haul ass before I up and blast with no mask
And blow off you bit of mustache with yo tough ass
Shit everybody's bustin' down
My niggaz fallin' off all around
Before I go, I got my 50-rounds
To blaze a nigga before I hit the ground
He lay
[Chorus]
[Sko]
It's really gettin' hot on the block
Niggaz got they glocks, niggaz sellin' they rocks
But my mind prepared to get this muthafuckin' knot
So a nigga ain't scared to put a nigga in the box
If I gotta drop him down in the grave
In the grave he gon' lay-he
Cause this shit don't stop, I shut 'me down everyday
Everyday anyway he, anyway he
If he grown or not, wrong or not
Niggaz better shake the spot and praise Allah
Don't let me see yo face nowhere by the peace Allah
A laundry mat, niggaz better have they glocks cocked off
Ready to blast off and get yo ass popped off
With 10 hot ones when I draw from ?? when I smash off over there
It's blood on the curb over there
And them niggaz that be actin' like nerds over there
And my niggaz that be flippin' plenty birds over there
For them niggaz that be gettin' on my nerves over there
For my brothers that be gettin' plenty dirt over there
For them ?? broads with all that weave in they hair
Who ain't got no walls, pussy like bees in the air
She dropped them draws and then I zoomed outta there
Cause I got my laws, I'ma stay strong to myself
And I thought about y'all, that's why I ball by myself
I don't need no mob to make me feel like myself
I don't need no job, I'll make these G's by myself
I'ma be aight, breakin' my hands to the left
I can see aight, I smell death on yo brea-ea-ea-ea-eath

[Intro: Twista + (Ludacris)]
Yeah, you know it's about to go down right?
(Yeeah!) Got to let them know who is this? (Ludacris!)
And who else nigga? (Twista, wooo, ahhh!)
Uh, uh (check it out)
[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Sometimes I think that I got to see a little bit of brighter days
Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left or the right but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my ways
I still hear a fool and I track them, distract them, and whack them
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak them, attack them, and sack them
Get a weapon and I crack his brain cause I'm a hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night, so talk shit and I'm a lift them up off of they toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In a two-seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of dro
Smoking, choking, get them open, croaking
It's so potent - I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it or keep it hidden, good riddance I'm felling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off
They'll see you later, go to the doctor, hold my balls and (cough)
You caused some vapors and I caught the throne, brain blown, honey I'm home
Give me the microphone, and fools is like, ""leave me alone!""
[Chorus: Twista]
Throw it up if you get high, get blow, get drunk
If you want what I'm on, come on and kick it
Let's ride, smoke dro, beat the trunk
All the bad ass bitches that want to party
Just shake it, great players get pumped
Me and my thugs, and hustlers in the party
Get money fuck hoes, get crunk
[Verse 2: Twista]
(Look out!) I put a little bit of hash on some motherfucking purple haze
I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi
Got me up and then rippng shit in a rage
In the netti cofetti with a belly, Gucci
Timberland stepping on the petal up in the Cadillac truck
Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it
I'm leaking the fluids out of the bodies that want to come at this
If they all get some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury
My adversaries better not want none of Twis'
Represent for my city, anybody that different with me
Got to get him for thinking it's a game
And whether you from my city or not, talk shit
I'ma kill him especially if he say my name
I've been up on him - I handle my business
And I'm a stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat piller
Murder haters that don't feel a
Niggaz claiming they want to bring it, but really don't be killers
Balling out so hard the size of my rims grow to a hellafied sight-scene
When the dough become no bigger, I'm going to drop that 2003 on 19""
[Chorus: Twista]
[Verse 3: Twista]
We balling out of control, I floss on, play on, pimp on
A speed deamon, pedal to the metal when I'm in the zone
Hang on cause here I'm gone
In the motherfucking wind when I'm sippin on Henn'
I got paper, you owe something
And I done came a long way from letting me hold something, to roll something
Find a body, then fill him up with some adrenaline
And then kill him and send him to the cemetery
With a flow for the whole world like a poet,
Check icy cold, your Pop's so hungry, he mends a berry
Shit, and when it come to shipping good
Who that?, who that?, I got the sack open
And the herb got the flow so strong
Hot them on crack, the track is for back-to-back smoking
Never come up with it unwise, and he
nigga you ain't untouchable when I spark the heat
Coming at you like sharks to meat
the blood is softly, I can tell when a mark is hard as we
Come fully loaded cause I'm hard to beat
always screaming where a beat and the dro at?
You know we love that cut up
In the back of the club with purple in the back crying

[VERSE 1 (Twista)]
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks,
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block, And I
Wish my brother woulda made bail,
So I won't have to travel 6 hours to see him in jail, And I
Wish that my grandmother wasn't sick,
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick, And I (I wish)
Wish my homies wouldn't have to suffer,
When the streets get the upper had on us and we lose a brother, And I
Wish I could go deep in a zone,
And lift the spirits of the world with the words with in this song, And I (I wish)
Wish I could teach a could teach a soul to fly,
Take away the pain out cha hands and help you hold them hi, And I
Wish God never gave the men power
To be able to hurt the people inside the Twin Towers, And I (I wish)
Wish God woulda turned they hearts righteous,
When they started to take innocent lives and become snipers, But uh
We will never break, though they devistate, we shall motivate,
And we gotta pray, all we got is faith.
Instead of thinking about who gonna die to day,
The Lord is gonna help you feel better, so you ain't gotta cry today.
Sit at the light so long,
And then we gotta move straight forward, cuz we fight so strong,
So when right go wrong,
Just say a little prayer, get ya money man, life go on!!!
Let's HOPE!

Cuz I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today,

Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people commin up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing,
Watch the music and have ?em trippin of the joy I bring, (shiit)
I wish that we could hold hands,
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man, And I (I wish)
Wish the families that lack, but got love, get some stacks
Brand new shack and a lack that's on dubs, And I
Wish we could keep achieving wonders,
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me) (I wish)
And I hope all the kids eat,
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
I hope them mothers stain? strong,
You can make it whether you wit him or your mans gone, And I (I wish)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary,
And the po po bring the heat on them priest like they did R. Kelly, And I
Wish that DOC could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again,
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN,
I wish that enemies could talk,
And that super homie Christopher Reeves could still walk, (I wish)

Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war,
Why can't we kick it and just get em on,
And in the famous words of Mr. King ?Why can't we all just get along?,
Or we can find a better way to shop and please, And I
Hope we find a better way to cop a keys, And I
Wish everybody would just stop and freeze,
And ask way are we fulfillin these downfalls and prophecies,

With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains,
And only the heavenly father and ease the hurt,
Just let it go and keep prayin on your knees in church!!

Once again  another Trax productions
Rush for the 9 8  mobsta elites
Ain't it a shame how we make ballin' look so sweet
Especially when you ain't gotta hide your shit
You know what I'm sayin'  you can just ball for free
Campaignin' your nation  in a legit demonstration
And gotta face incarceration
Eh yo  Liffy Stokes  let 'em know what's happenin'
[Liffy Stokes]
A nigga been hustlin' so long, God knows I've done so much wrong
I was 16 grown and holdin' chrome, servin' blows, we in' zones
My mom didn't understand me ""Boy, you gon' die just like your daddy
From two to the head, dumped in the riverbed, I didn't to hurt you so badly""
I was young and dumb, fast life sprung of the money and hoes that it brung
Had a clip full of hollows to bring your momma sorrow
But now regret what I've done
Drama's all in the game, was it gangbang or slay
I had to do my thang
When the shots rang, that's when it clicks in my brain
All the shit's the same
My nigga need a change, I had to get off out these streets
To get you out your seat
Flip a Trax beat, hit the crib and puff on a sweet
And let 'em feel something deep
Deep so the realest can feel
How I felt right before I bust that steel
Rappin' about my life of (?)
And the everyday struggles of a nigga in the chill
[Chorus 2x]
Come on and take a ride, triple to legit ballers
Shot-shot callers (Shot up the chrome and let's swang)
Tigers all up in the wall
(Some bitches in the back and a pocket full scraps to get matchin')
(Spark a couple of love bud and get blown away)
[Mayz]
This sweet I've been talkin' was potent
Got me straight thinkin' about takin' Mary Jane and eloping
Blowin' smoke with the sunroof half-way opened
Countercode with the scope in close range
I guess he gotta aim, and stick a few thangs in the nigga's brain
No face straps (?) thinkin' that he can
Puttin' food on table is an everyday strain
But now I did finally flip my shit legit
And workin' a different angle of the game
Even though my hussle ain't changed
I'm still prayin' my best presence to overcome my pain
Singin' tapes of cain
The roads to riches seems longer than the freight train
And every little stop keep a nigga tryin' to plot
On the paper you done gain until you drain
But I put that on the floor
I'ma flow 'til I got no choice, or better yet no voice
But still by that time I hope to write enough rhymes
To own a fleet real estate with a Rolce Royce
Rollin' deep through this Chi-Town streets
With my mobsta elite on the way to the Riverside Mall
Givin' thanks to the all for givin' me a legit where to ball at
Keepin' shit tight for y'all
[Chorus 2x]
[Twista]
On the bus in disgust will I able to throw rocks in my pocket
Nickel sacks in the other
For po-pos who watch, can't stop, it's hot
But I gotta make a profit for my baby and my mother
Straight up hustler
What's the mental frame of mind
That nigga had to have the roll
Be sold, or be poor up in these city streets
Or with the pistol playin' for you Mr. Reaper
Forgive those, I explode like c-4 so give me 50 feet
Bustin' shots in every directions a nigga stop a moment from getting made
I done witnessed public aid, people get sprayed, the tip raise
And momma cry, why my bills won't get paid
If I have to I'ma send cheese from blows
Nobody can hurt me or run thugsta greed, GD's or foes
Workin' the spot 'cause we need some clothes
Who ever thought I'd be making money off of my CD's and shows
My crib got gats in the hall, rats steady crawl
Roaches comin' out the cracks in the wall
On the tip, bust it with my back to the wall
Work my way up to an ounce, now I'm back to a ball
Now I fin to spend stacks at the mall
Bend the blocks on barbers hopin' my profits stack a bit taller
Twista AKA ""The Bitch Caller"", bring your money to the mob
Just to be a pimp-shit talker
[Chorus 2x]
[Twista]
If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm
It it's on, then I gotta ride out with the mobstas, hmm-hmm
If it's on, I gotta ride out with my mobstas, hmm-hmm

[Intro: Girl]
This goes out to all sides worldwide,
Let that playa ass nigga Twista be
yo guide, as we go on a ride,
Hood to hood, chrome, leather, and wood,
And it feels so good...
[Twista]
One mornin' I...
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick,
Feelin fucked up, flicked out, freaked on,
Thinkin' about my new truck with tha' deep dish,
Meanin' deep chrome, deep chrome, in tha deep dome,
After a massage and a ménage, we got in tha shower,
Let water trickle down tha crack of tha back of they booty,
Got out tha tub and went back to tha master bedroom,
One put on prada, one put on Ludi, I put on gucci,
Duty calls, I'm bout to hit tha scene and ball,
But before I leave I spray on some Itsimiaki,
Take my truck up to tha wash, put tha sparkle back on,
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miagi,
Go to tha liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak,
So I can sip some while I split one,
Chronicle enter ever pholical of my body,
Calmin' down every molecule, makin' sure I dont trip none,
Hit one...
Hop in tha' ride, come and kick it wit me,
So I can take you through tha' so-and-so hundred block,
And show you how my people be kickin' it in tha windy city,
I wanna show you where I hang out at, where we make our scratch,
While we sit on leather grippin' wood,
Where tha' hustla's got packs and tha G's got stacks,
And tha' pimps got lacks, rollin' through tha hood,
And it feels so good...
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
And it feels so good,
Turnin' corners with my pinky man,
Through my hood,
Chokin' on a B and switchin' lanes is understood (understood...),
I'm a baller livin' pimpish,
Man, leather and wood,
Said it feels so good (feels so good...),
[Twista]
Now I done seen plenty niggas flip twenty's, flip twenty one's,
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours,
Mega ballin', new clothes,
Momma got a new store, tv screens, hundred-forty spokes,
And we fittina' roll, right off madison to tha manor in a drop-top Lexus,
Sippin' henny rollin' reckless, feelin' so motherfuckin' good I could roll my vehicle to
Texas,
And spit it like, this is for tha syrup sipper's...
Gotta slow it down so you feel it, plus it make tha words figure,
And spit some screwed shit and do shit so that you understand,
When it come to spittin' rapid-fire lyric adrenaline then I be the motherfuckin' man...
Get tha love, when I hit tha club gotta freak in, it's the weekend and the dj bumpin' tatoo,
Track move like some southern, black blues, or like tha Cooper, got cruise,
And they got shoes it's packet-proof instead I be tha hottest rap...
Dude...Ride to this while you peel, yo, hood,
You could go around tha block or travel tha whole world, when you come back it's still yo
hood,
And it feels so good...
[Chorus]
[Twista]
I spit some game wit tha intellect, to tha media, like I'm in tha Encyclopedia Brittanica,
Come and take over tha world wit' me girl, if you good I might can see if I can be yo manager,
Get yo career on track and yo life on point and i'll show you how yo taxes go...
Tactics flow quicker than a hat-trick go, smokin on some fire, galactic dro,
I know it's good when you smoke that fire, puff that herb, get that dirt, hit that lick,
Cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bently car, cop yourself a motherfuckin' Bently crib,
Pop that ass, throw that dick, twork that thing, bust that nut,
Drop that top, turn tha base up, put you a chameleon paint on tha truck,
Get iced up, bumpin' Twista grooves as I cruise new shoes rollin' smooth up in K-Town,
In my city come and feel it ghetto blues, if you snooze you lose don't pay dues for tha
tre-pound,
Take tha time to kick wit' yo home girls... And feel yo nugz...
Keep on hatin' on tha L, big family we gon' steady come up and Im'a still smoke good,
And it feels so good...
[Chorus 2X]
[Outro]
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some...
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some...
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some...
Roll one, light one, smoke one, sip some..

this is Joliet Correctional Facility
you have a collect call from inmate
yeah this is Tucker
to accept this call please press 3 now
thank you
hello
[Turtle Banxx]
hey sis let me speak to momma
who me on find besides all the drama
the system took me in but then they took me under
I suffer being another number
I wonder if I could conquer dis criminal structure built to puncture
the hearts of men
when them guards come in the bars and the pen
I know I'm in hell and its hard to win
I stay up late lying in the dark for me
thinking bout the night the police came marching in
its like they wouldn't stop barging in
asking momma what mob I'm in
try strictly left us some scars within
fighting back the lyrics of a favorite baptist him
its over now cant hold a child
mold a child scold a child or own a child a soldier now
baby hold your tears
become a teacher mold ya peers
let em know its cold in here
this ain't the way to spend them older years
I'm over the fears of the world
no longer momma's pearl in here
its all clear them older cats school me to the game
I'm all ears no mo rats or any cold beers
the ghetto famous disappear
[chorus 1]
they run up in my home
and took you from my world
now ya gone and I'm feeling all the pain that your going through
[chorus 1 in background of chorus 2]
[chorus 2]
sometimes I lay back in my cell crying
hells blind but I hope I make it through this jail time
trying to stay focus but I heard they mad me panic before
I guess thats what I got my family for behind bars
[Turtle Banxx]
I'm running outta time
momma there yet
where my little brother let me holla at him
whats up cat
I got you covered
stay in the books them streets is a motha
undercovers posing as hustlers exposing the brothers controlling the
struggle by any means
brutality got the police running like the enemy
our community need more hugs instead of the slugs the guns the drugs
got crime on killing the love the spirits above
drop a warning sigh its only 1999
but all I think about is 85 them good times
momma give us her last dime
icey cups you drop yours I give you mine
true love define us to divine
calling it on another's pride but I hate to see you cry
the rain come shine
my family feel my pain inside
by the way my baby momma getting married
brought tears to my eyes I just hope my son happy
[chorus 1]
[chorus 1 in background of chorus 2]
[chorus 2]
[Turtle Banxx]
ran to the phone got a hundred guys like me
and all we have is precious minutes to reach our people our free
brother listen be strong for momma
let her know I never meant to cause her no drama
the pain make my vain cries thunder
will I recover my name and still discover how the game become us
look how they done us
watered down our pride and drunkers riders g's and hustlers
we gotta guide our younger theres better days among us
never let the rage you under upstage the promise till tomorrow
and the C's just follow wont feel the sorrow
for the misery we wallowing time swallowing
them better days in this gaze got my mind boggling
oh momma and hey lady I miss you
and them ways you raised me them hard head things that drove you crazy
realize ya son took a lot of heart from ya
its phone check time I'm gone momma I love you

Oh - back again makin the rhythm kick jazz
Used to be wick-wack, now I got funky pizzazz
Idryss'll do my fade-up cause he cuts em like class
And the chicks want me to lick cause I'm too quick, I think I'll pass
Dollars, if I don't fold em, I roll em like a bolo
Other steppin to brothers cause he be God? Oh no
G-o-d, I be not he, it's true, don't call me loco
And my man Eric the Wiz will stir the mini mix up like Coco
Cut like Michael Myers, start up fires, I'm a scar hard
Thinkin I be wimpy, I just simply rip em far apart
Ansaars in New York, I know that you know that you are God
This brother's from Chicago, so I guess I'm a Chigagod
Rhythm is my producer of rhythms on the wax
The posse Lower Level be kickin some funky tracks
Never ask, I ax, I get madder than Max
Diggem smacks, if they try to tax I play em like a sax
[CHORUS]
Rock - me call it what?
(Razzamatazz)
Rock - me call it what?

[VERSE 2]
Styles, I hand em, I brand em like cattlecakes
Better get flows from your bros if a battle takes
I hear a hiss, the tale of a taddle shakes
Backs this breaks givin aches to the rattlesnakes
I get spunky with funky stylin
Rhythms I flow, I kick them wild and
Tryin to get with the styles I'm pilin
For your sob story I better get the violin
Come again - watch a fun one construct
I don't like sissy chickens and I hate a sucker duck
Some label me a sucker because ducks I like t pluck
The only way I be a sucker is if women wanna suck
Always goin broke so I don't dig into my stash
I'm cool as Brian Robbins on the show _Head of the Class_
If you don't get the picture, make the camera go flash
When this rhythm was a baby, doc spanked him on his - jaz
[CHORUS]
[VERSE 3]
Study my culture, soar like a vulture
My teacher Marvin Howard will create my sculpture
I'm kickin Islam, some brothers try to bomb
Facts can harm but I still say Salaam
Sometimes I blush, bust and leave puss
Hush if I must, plus I don't forget to flush
With suckers I fuss, thought I was soft like a slush
Chicagods crush cause they think toys r us
Hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
Is funky hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
'll make a drip (drip what) drop
I like to rip (rip what) shop
I always slip (slip what) cops
Reachin the tip (tip what) top
Come in again

Mi stamina rock, mi stamina rock, bloodclot, I do not know
Why they judge me by one rap and say too fast I flow

most of you motherfuckers is comical
the rule like me is impossible
verbally illogical I took the heat
and then followed you to your residence
and spread your molecules blood floods your follicles
damn right we don't acknowledge you
the streets got eyes of leopard for telling niggas to up weaponry
when they see your ass blast and feed your ass to the fish
life's a bitch that'll suck ya dick
and tell them guys we hit that cash
kick ass nigga they coming for the whole pie
old time guys that wont be satisfied till you lay in a grave
wont be satisfied till the location of the safe cave
some were shining too much so I hide in the shade
the minute you made this move gave him one to his brain

kill kill kill murder murder murder

I bury ya slug in them haters claiming they veins pump up
burying blood turns out y'all the scariest thug
on my nutsac thats how I get into sack
sorrow hollows I spit at ya jag if he don't die he gonna shit in a bag
from K Town to V.I.P. ain't no V.I.P.
ain't no three I.D.'s
that'll get you to a place where we got keys and peas off our trees
controversy wild niggas thats thirsty and bodily fluids
smoking terror that'll smell bloody hands on your soul like mascara
disciples of death
you wont even hear fears in they cry
don't you hear that cold in they throat and see they tears in they eyes

A grenade I'mma pull the pin out the sum bitch

Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre
Takin more blood than a 2000 dracula slip the clip in the

Prayin to jesus of Nazarus
A 7 day theory like makaveli flowin on a track that's
Scary wit a Mack in the back of the pelle
Spectacular how could you dare me I'm already willing to die
I'm comin back after they bury me
Its time for yo confessions I be the priest
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier
Better become a bible holder as I start to massacre
Men with a verbal recital that's colder
Deaths coming closer as you let kamikazi
Enter yo body careful or you die standin vertical
And anyone that opposes I swear to God I'mma get you

Hold all of the murderin' up, if you gotta bust a cap then aim it up
If you religious praise it up, if you gotta get high then blaze it up
For the ones who never gave it up,
Take a champagne glass and raise it up
Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood spilling
Poppin' lip and taking over his tip is why he had to kill him
Now his bodies in chalk and no longer can talk so then a life is lost
Somebody tricked off and the killer was caught
So now his lifes his cost
You might get caught
So to make a move these motherfuckers is petrified
All the best that tried won't even slide
So just bless the rest that died
Is it a test of pride when inside
You grip a trigger but you didn't wanna pull it
Could it be a motherfucker that you notice
On the other side of the bullet
Should it matter now you figure fuck it I'ma waste him
It's just a murda for the nation
But some end up locked up, broke up
For felonies and over overly motherly abrasion
Now in front of me encased in a coffin is a body
With people around sad and froze
Teardrops and rain
But folks didn't really feel the pain until the casket closed
I was drastic chose and the mother threw a frown
Even though the gunner was found
Cause it seems like yesterday when he was running around
Now he under the ground cause they gonna get down in these streets Even
though you pack a piece for heat these niggaz urgin' to bust
The game ain't the same so stay away from the curb
If you out there serving em' up and
[hook (repeat)]
w/ ""make a toast to yourself for survivng in a world that's so corrupt""
Agony was the feelin' when I saw his blood pouring
Tragedy mess a man look in the mirror then I see the stud mourning
As these streets erases others it encase a brother
You had enough heart to waste this brother
But could you face his mother I was faced with other
Type of problems that had held me back
Couldn't tell me jack now I'm gone in my own zone
You ain't gotta tell me that so me trail me back to a time
When a motherfucker 'd lost his will survive
Me and my folks had to hustle and steal for a meal
Eat or had to kill to survive
I remember when you had my back
When the relative passed and my momma cried
When the house caught flames
You collapsed in my arms when you heard that father d' died
I take drama in stride
Even though I had to go through a thing to get myself together
Still suffer but the worst is gone
So it's on till' the roamin' man have his shelter
But if I end up back on the streets again and I had to recieve my fate Smoke
weed at the wake so the pain and hate escapes
To keep the kids straight
Cause you did straight if your seed proceed
As long as they keep learning and keep growing up
Right now we survive in a place that's full of doubt
And about to self-destruct
[hook x2]
Visualize in invisible eyes how I individualize
Critical cries of pitiful skies that rain pain upon the ghetto land
Where the unforgettable dies
Subliminal lies mean a motherfucker never gone make it
If he don't peep it and keep it in check soon
Womb to the tomb death is in the next room
If a nigga ain't realizin' a k's and tech's doom
Let's assume another brother wanna laugh at you
I think he just took a blast at you
You won't have it you killed him
There go the trigger try to kick it but his niggas coming after you Telling
you a stranger must be crazy
To step it to a motherfucker that's dangerous
Cause it's a gang of us throwin' knuckles in the scuffle
If we have two things of bust
It's cocaine to us and my brains to dust
I represent you up there so I try
Long as I leave my enemy bust vacinity crushed
I don't really give a fuck if I die
So why lie my people should be glad to survive in the land of the lost It's a
plan of the boss leaving motherfuckers dying
With their grandmother's hand on the cross
So I take a stand when I talk ran instead of walked
To chalk another victory
How you did the caper hid the paper
Breaking other niggas off is a mystery
With the chemicals and drugs all of these criminals and thugs
Just keep comin' up better watch yourself ain't no love in the streets In a
ghetto of a world that's corrupt

Sorrows improbable
In Chicago motherfucker, bones get fractured, crumble like crackers
Rush the stage, allow the crowd to witness your massacre
You ain't bone, you're marrow, the lead travels from barrels
Bloody apperal, unravvle, chances is narrow

Before you end up facedown
You motherfuckers don't know a thang about me

Lakeside, 9-Tre, the Long City
Wild Hundreds got love for that nigga Nitty
Give me room when my adrenaline rushing
Cause if I go in that trunk, you know I'm 'bout to start dumping
You hear the cries as the bullets fly by
And in the end that motherfucker died

Gettin' down and dirty, try to come at the mob and get your body bloody
Hungry, I was lookin' for the fetti', ready
With the mental that was heavy, now her niggas ain't ready
Fuck the Navigator, we was filling holes in that 87' Chevy
Sitting on thirty-thirties
Selling leaf and syrup on the corner trying to stir this
Had a strap with the handle that was pearly
Up early, (?)
Know the game don't scare me, competition better flury or get buried
Either scuffle or scurry, brother hunt the word down
If you want a piece better hurry
Got off our knees and putting arrows on our tip
But there's really no need for you to say we ain't shit
Got up the cheese by telling motherfuckers freeze, and run in their cribs
Now we like to ball legit
Got to get up off the gold and the dick
Roll with a clique of hustlers thats strugglin'
Pistol bustin' and mean muggin'
Get up out the way my armored heavy family huntin'
Cause ain't nothin' gonna stop us from rollin'
Rap flow and the strap holdin', tired of feeling like I'm closed in
In the back, roll in on my ass when we got going
Out the back door like smoking,
and tripping on the brink of success or failure
Momma, I can't call when I'm caught in the thin line
And it's kinda hard to tell ya'
But on the blood of my city, I'm a' keep crawling up the barbed wire
Hold your guns higher, cause ain't none higher
Feel the heat from our gunfire, can you see us coming
Making niggas running, wild and heartless and we steady gunning
Don't fuck with a legit baller, don't cut your ass
Come up out the trunk so fast
Y'all will get murdered when the pump go blast
Set this bitch on fire, when we roll on chrome,
smokin' blow in the zone
Kicking up more shit than a broken bone
Don't fuck with a legit baller, steady stacking bread
And be ready for the armageddon
Try to come at the mob and get your body deadened

Now I could tell from back in tha days when we was shawtys in tha hood
Dat you was gone grow up to be thick as hell and lookin good
Now you 21 and them thighs aint no crunk
Lookin fine as hell like a penny junk up in the trunk
Make a nigga get (get) what you want
Put dat ass on dubs

Feel it when you twirk it in tha club
Feel it when you get down on tha floor
Love when you get down on tha low

Baby I jus got some 24s and I love to watch em spin (spin)
So let me see you make dat ass roll like my rims

Dissed her then bounced wit her sista

You can keep dat pussy imma tear dem pretty lips up
Let dat ass roll like 24s on a big truck
And ya g-string let it bounce when da beat bang
Make it drop like dem cars in a g-thang
Pull up ya skirt and work it like da hook keep sangin
[Chorus]
Come on shorty make dat ass pop
Drop it like a rag top
Shake it likes its bongo
Stir it up like credit rock
I got a pocket full of tens and dubs
I'm up in the club drunk as fuck stuck
Lookin for love
They lookin for dust
And I got dem in gods we trust
A lil game a lil fame
I'll have em pilin in tha church bus
Puffin da juan dro straight up to tha condo
Open tha bus doors head up to tha 12th floor

She shook one cheek at a time den dropped it back down

[Toxic]
Saw a little motherfucker and y'all was ready to bend
Left the mob for something petty but then fetti got thin
Now you back where you begin while I'm livin on ten
Got inns sittin in a Benz wit rims sippin on Hen
Wit Stokes, Twist, and Mayze while you broke bitch I'm paid
Should of stayed but betrayed look at the cheddar you could have made
You started with the mob thought you was harder than the mob
But ain't no one motherfucker larger than this mob
Swear to god, for y'all C-Wall ain't got love
No only one that's gonna be on you side is this hot slug
For the dead and locked I'm throwin my mob up
Cock and bust to all y'all bitches die for crossin us
[Liffy Stokes]
I smell some bitch niggas amongst us, now they gone
And when you see me on the streets be strapped cause I'm at you dome
And that's wit or without a mask on, cause I'ma blast on sight
Even if it's in traffic in broad daylight
The only way you live if it don't spray right
But you out your death wish so if I miss you'll be facin barrels by midknight
And that's on these four fingers I hold high
Anybody who crosses my mobsta family they die
I hollered at my boy James to bless me wit some mo' thangs
A mobstaz hard to kill like stopping off of cocaine
I'm leavin out sweated no dynasty clicks crushin bitches wit this
Nigga your songs ain't shit, they can't even fade our skits eat a dick
[Chorus]
Nigga cross the mob so what's up
In every destination retaliation gotta fuck ?em up
Nigga cross the mob so what's up
In every destination retaliation gotta get ?em up
Shit are y'all about ready to die for this fetti fuck everyting that's petty
Down to do dirt lets put in work
Stay together whether we rappin of slangin ye together
Get the paper but don't cross the mob and get hurt loyalty's first
[Traxster]
When everything was all good y'all niggas threw the wall up
But when the shit hit the fan I watch you bitches ball up
Now you time is all up, fuck who you call up
My niggas all bust, my killas all nuts
What the fuck you call us, what you say about C-Wall
Playa hatin how we ball, nigga we'll be to see y'all
And you mob gonna end up the same homie, put this pain on you
No love my slugs got them thugs name on ?em
If he wit his kids I'm blow his brains on ?em, put the chains on ?em
Go insane on em', guess he done wit that work range on em
Rain over, so nigga respect my mob like royalty
?Till I'm dead y'all hoes dred my love, life, and loyalty
[Twista]
When you come strapped in a circle
No I'm finna hurt you
Cause the mob put me peeped all of your loopholes
Cause the trigger work you
Bust all of you bitches and all of you hoes
When the bruh come
Thugs betta run shit look at what thugs want
See what drugs done
When held the gun got you runnin from a loved one
Thought you was down to die but you been found to lie
So fuck you can't trust you, gotta bust you
Crush you now you can't lick hits and hustle
Try to flex your muscle
But my criteria gotta over comes yo strategies
Try to make a mob out of peas
I can ride on you wit Money-T and an amount of cheese
Plus I had a lot of bud in ?em
I get mad at the budgin' ?em
Whippin out the stud in ?em
But I ain't even studying
If again and it's on I just put a slug in him
Duggin him dead and headin hoes off at the pass
Open up a can of kick ass
Toy wit me loyalty die quick blast
[Maze]
I roll wit straight mobsta leaners
That always carry beamers
And exercising trigger fingers on niggas who come between us
Shockin' the world wit young slingers
And we can't be defeated, even if you triple team us
Cause this game got my mod deranged if you in pain
Kamokaze like my nigga Lo if we loose to you man
So ready to aim cause it ain't shit to explain
Shots to exchange plenty of paper in the game
To help us remain on top of the world until we go bang
Doin our thang while y'all niggas just hate and complain in vain
But it'ws still gonna be the same we gonna mob forever
And out shine all you bitch ass niggas together

What's happenin, y'all?
This is Tyrone Chillinfoot down with the funky Tung Twista, baby
[number] inches of straight stupid, straight ignorant dope funky stuff for ya, baby
So turn up your radio and get down to the Tung Twista
Kick it, gee
Let the Cavalier Tung kiss ya, it's the Mista Tung Twista
Pumpin a rhythm, a lyrical styler
My tongue'll be flingin a funky pile of
Lyrical rhymes that's breakin em off in the mind, I be flowin em holy, I'm
Kickin the funky Islam, my lyricals slippin em like petroleum, slowly I'm
Pumpin the flow of the lyric, I'm breakin em off with the radical texture
I'm one brother you could never get next ta
Flex your style, I'm gonna give em a lyrical pump of the rhythm of Cav
And crackin em up with the word of the wise
I be bringin em up in the flow of the funky dialect
I elect a flow for suckers that try a wreck
I spark the light of a head and be wakin em up and then cause a fly effect
I insist ya lay with the path of my rhythm and follow me like a scripture
Flowin this from my lung, a tongue twister
Mista, my style'll be makin a dent and be leavin the tracks bent
Steppin is the lyrical black gent, my Nubian accent
Breakin em up and then makin em take in the smell of my funk I be kickin up in em
And then I'ma give em a lick of my lyrical lollypop, I'm gonna bring em into my doctrine
Rock, then the rhythm'll makin the clock spin blackwards
The funk of the rhythm'll snap, crackle and pop, then flow, oh
I'm makin em follow the path of a God and my track'll be blacker than Cocoa
This lyric I'm makin is dope, don't call it so-so
Don't dis the Tung Twista
Leavin the suckers soft as a whisper, Tung kiss ya like a sister
Then I'ma let it be known that it's the way that I throw
That's makin the funk of the lyrical glow
And how I tell it, yo Cav is kickin a funkedelic flow, and oh, my fist'll
Swing at the rhythm of suckers, then I'm gonna give em a Tung blister
It's the Mista Tung Twista
Ha-ha-heeey
Boy, that's Tung Twista for ya
Comin at ya in 3d
Ha-ha-ha
?? funkier than that, boy
Check it out
Kick it again
My tongue is spinnin
I follow with Allah and the Father be stoppin the Cavalier from sinnin
The lyrical rhythm beginning and then in the endin
I ratatattat tactics, give em black kicks
Flow of the lyric I'm pumpin and rappin em up is dope as a crack fix
Wack? It's - funky, I'm greater
Never to step at the lyrical dictator, a state of
Shock is what I put a sucker into, then to mentally
Go with the smell I be stylin, gee, funky is what the scent'll be
Harmin this? Uh-uh, the Cavalier's kickin my charm in this
Simply because I'm in this, I'm as dope as a pharmacist
Calmin this? Hype as a rattle be shakin and rippin the rhythm
And breakin up into a sweat, I be workin the lyrical servin a sucker
So never come near a, lyricist Cavalier - ah
Rock the flow of the lyrical rhythm be shinin like a mirror
Hear a sucker step at the Twist, ya gotta be goin like this to beat me
The funk of the lyric will flow from me like peepee
You caught a work of my tongue as I be flow flowin like water
Crackin em up with a flow and sort of slaughter I oughta
?? I'm bracin Nubian nations, race and chasin
My tongue your tastin, a quick pace and facin lyrical wastin
Tungs'll be cut like Jason, racin
Tung Twista rocks, your lip'll lock
My tongue'll be makin a tick tick or tick tock to Nubian hip-hop
Flip-flopped, a flow when I wrote this
Kickin and makin some hocus pocus, focus
Tongue will be flippin just like this I'ma locus
Givin a diagnosis for Twisterosis
Crackin a mouth and them makin em ache I'ma put em up into a coma
You're sniffin dope aroma
I'm blendin
I'm able to break up a sucker that you might send in
The funk of the lyrical rhythm beginnin
Spinnin the suckers around like a dollar
Be makin em holler kickin the funk of a lyrical scholar
I pray to Allah, I'm makin this funky like I'm a hobo
Throw better than bolo, ya thinkin that he can battle my solo
Just say oh no cause that's a no-no
When I be smellin the funk of my flow, jo
I'm pumpin this up and breakin this in with a lyrical, then say haha
Take titles, then say ta-ta
I'm rippin a rap and then rockin a rhythm and ring in my tongue I'ma bend em
And flow with a lyric it's steppin inside em
And get with the funk I be pumpin up in em

Talkin behind my back is makin it seem like it's a rumor
So tell me fact to face when you can decide to come to Juma
Don't say your name backwards because you don't like Cav
Played to the left by def and I'm gonna eff up the right half
The sucker descendant of Canaan, I'ma let my pizzazz wreck
I'm speakin this to the devil that calls his self an Aztec
You ain't a Puerto-Rican, know what I'm speakin, Islam you're seekin
You might as well open the doors of a church and become a deacon
Don't step to me, speakin the pep to me about what your rep'll be
Crept to me because I let them see that you had leprosy
Them suckers that be dissin me I simply just insist ya
Stop steppin against the Mista Tung Twista
He-heeey
Now that was bad, baby
But if you think that was somethin
Wait till you hear the album
He-he-hey
I like to give a shout to my son [Name]
And ?? to Eric the Wiz
Cavalier
Of course Cavalier, it's his album
[Name]
My man [Name]
Kooley
And the DJ Cut
And the whole entire hip-hop nation
We Audi 5000
Take the mic, y'all
Ha-haa
Do the robotic robot

[Twista]
Gang Bangin ain't go' never die, as long
As niggaz ain't got nothing we go' be thuggin forever high
Ain't no more drive by's, niggaz chase you down til they get you
Multiple slugz found in your tissue
Whatever it is you should've honored it
when them niggaz told you not to come around here
And you was found here
Your death is now near
I'm bout to put a bullet in his gut, catch him at the stop sign
And dump em' in his nuts. Now lets play a game of find and search
While your mamma cryin' in church
I'll be spyin for work
I'ma go right on
Cause when your life's gone
Nigga there is no replacement
And you got your work hid in the basement
I got it, gothic
Go for the endo, she's smokin hydro-ponic chronic
Blow out the heart like entity injuries upon my body
don't help heal up the scar, so baby don't cry
cause mob niggaz don't die
[Liffy Stokes]
Mob niggaz ain't go' never die
We in the lot, callin shots, keeping
Dope fiends forever high
Forever fire get lit wit the trigger eye
Twenty split, gun the bitch, leave her dead I
Man I put your block on four
Hit k town and come back wit a bus load
Full of niggas that's down and dirty, pushin thirty
Minutes beef it gets muddy
But I'ma swim through the murky water
Hold it down like a carter, live long like a godfather
Kick Volvo's, fuck tight hoes
Live a life many kill and fight for
And campaign in this rap game, cause ain't nothing out
here in these motherfucking
Streets man, and that's comin from a nigga you know who chose
To be legit and still rip foes
[Chorus 1 x2]
Mob niggas, cause drama, till it's hot
get shot, see the dot
Same day back on the block, set up shop
hat throw thuggin, throwin up
Fo's and forks, strapped up
screamin out I ain't gon' never die
[Chorus 2 x2]
we can be shot at, battered and bruised
bloody and left out in the cold
But real niggaz never fall, if I'm a hundred years old
I'm still gonna murder you
Cause mob niggaz don't die
[Turtle Banxx]
We release no doubt
Just close are eyes and open fire
Mash and bang on niggaz let them hot boys fly
You can tell a maniac got a look in his eye, card green, two
Magazines and a throw away knife
My position is thorough composition
Competition is minimum blocks
We bendin them shots
We're sendin them at the rhythm
Hit them put venom in them
Bloody up him in his jeans
And watch the white shirt study the scene
Gang bangin aint go' Never cease
As long as there's streets, police and heat, dope rocks and weed
Chronic, empty stomachs and mouths to feed
Who want it niggaz off the deed
The K Town we spray round
So stay down, this aint no play ground around here
You could get found around here
Shot up, battered and bruised
Headline of the news
The chosen, the few, mob niggaz don't die fool
[Chorus 1 x2]
[Chorus 2 x2]
[Liffy Stokes]
Hey, my papa told me, boy if, you wanna be a G
you gots, to flip them keys
And avoid, them federalies
Cause they, be on that ass
Ready to blast fast
Nigga fuck ask they take it, an' I'm shakin' off
charges like Payton
Hot stepping out the courtroom in gators, true playaz
No the business
No case without a witness, its senseless to resist this
Hostile take over
To late to pray to Jehovah, death closer, I lit him up like a toaster
Then put my shit back in my holsta
Blood crumbled on the posters
I gave a foe like a nigga was supposed ta
[Twista]
Shit, was wit the bogus bird, I don't want it
I can tell when I rub my finger across it it got sumthin on it
Fuck it if you niggaz wanna get killed wit a chick in the coat
Cause you can die wit the dick in the throat, hittin the dro
Back on the block servin
After the murder packin
For work cuz we're lucky popo's ain't havin 'em nervous
Think what I was in, family show up, an' the enemy
they lay, got it locked wit ten rolls
If they spray, fuck it
I'ma come back in the buck n'bloody fractures on my body
Bustin out on the public, bringin' the ruckus
Screamin, die punk motherfuckers
Reminice on how them hoes put the nigga on crutches
Smokin' on dutches, fifty sack in my clutches
Ballin no flows go, hataz Askin' how the mob's so strong
I belong to the breathin' niggaz that wanna take over after pop
Label me the verbal aftershock
I'ma never die!

Get up in here and do our thang  heh
That's how we gon' do
Hahahaha
[Twista]
Get down to the club
Chokin' on sticky and everything was loved  oh yeah
Look here now
Then on came the lights  hey
All the niggas and bitches in the party was feelin' high
Liffy Stokes bring it
[Liffy Stokes]
Tonight's gon' be the bomb  it's warm and calm
I got to take this cool in my arm with an ounce in my palm
I done took the bottle with Don, and I'm back for sure
Actin' a fool, gettin' skully, mixin' henny and mo
With plenty to draw, and we gotta blaze by the door
With too much M to the O from rushin' the dance floor
Mob style runnin' wild through every section and aisle
Drinkin' River, pissy now, collectin' numbers to dial
Talkin' loud, flash the cheese just for the haters and keys
That try to catch me sooner so they can cease without the cheese
Through mobstability, y'all be killin' me
With that weak shit, a nigga just came to party
With my guys and women probably pitchin' couple of innings
Break 'em down through my winnings and come out to drink winnin'
With my paper and ladies on the E doin' about eighty
Tryin' to get to the (?) so that freaky bitch can lay me
[Chorus]
When the mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
The mobstas rock y'all spot
Watch all the niggas and bitches start dancin'
Big ballers wave y'all knots
'Cause y'all the ones playa haters can't stand with
[Mayz]
I'm bendin' curves through the gym straight smokin' and drinkin'
Westside, mob style, and the mink and the lickin'
Trippin' on the cutie that's winkin'
'Cause she know we got the shit that rocks her block
And put the boom in your box and make your speakers pop
So I take this as my cue to make sure shorty don't snooze
The mobsta's rockin' tonight at the House of Blues
With some mo and some crews and now she lookin' in dues
Talkin' about bringin' our homies and puttin' on dancin' shoes
It's like that y'all, let your paper stack tall
So when you hit the club you can ball and get some numbers to call
Don't worry about the playa haters leanin' on the wall
Because when they get the gold and start to ball
They gonna have to fight us all to the end
Playas get a glass and a set of twins
In different clothes so they can be a thug's extend
'Cause when this party ends another begins it don't stop
So flash your knot and beep me at my guy's red shop
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Hey hey, oh suki-suki now, look here now, what's cookin' now
Shook it shook it, child, shake it down, let's boogie now
From the hood and I be the chief, feelin' good as taters and waiters
With playas with the ladies pullin' up in big-ridin' Mercedes
This party gon' fade me, smokin' with the brokes and the brothers
Cherry gators, yo dawg, this pocket's full hundreds and rollers
I'm kickin' it out with tippin' dippin' off from the laws
In the glance of an eye with drawers, while they hustlin' just to ball
(?) so I bought a drink, sport a link, recall the mink
Hoe figure she was pretty and think maybe I ought to wink
And she takes a glance, party'a boomin' so maybe I got a chance
This cutie got too much booty and I asked her to dance
Flippin' 50s in my hand, champagne all up in my face
Takin' pictures, (?) close 'em all bitches' probably in the place
Straight po pimpin', I'm trippin' (?) it's the weekend
Steady quickin', take a pimpin' and pay the scraps for sneakin'

We fin to bring this shit like this here
This muthafuckin' Chi shit  check it out
[Chorus 1]
The niggas in my mob can't be touched
You best to mob up to come fuckin' with us  oh no
Niggas in my mob bring the heat
You best to mob up fuckin' with the elite  oh no
[Liffy Stokes]
You just a bitch in the sky  I hear cries
'Cause you can't whistle for your guys
Surprise when you saw this pistols in your eyes
So I peal like mere mortals, bet I shoot bloody portals
To muthafuckas who owe us, niggas die, causin' horrifyin' (?)
My passion for blastin' made me an assassin on all enemies that work us
Whose purpose is to serve (?) timbs 'til they high and they hurt us
Murders got us murders, I pull my weed and gun out
Blastin' 'til they run in the house while I got the blunt in my mouth
[Mayz]
We in a rage bustin' rapidly like when I'm on stage
It don't get no rougher than Liffy Stokes, Twista and Mayz
In the blood of your day, then lay flat on your back
Then while he fuckin' your hoe
The mob gon' be straight coppin' you stack
[Twista]
Your mob lacks, I'ma defeat you run three-two on contact
Cogniac, get me strapped with the black gat itchin' to bomb back
Hoes can't get no sleep
Bullets hit your chin for the grief that you bring us
Shots hit his face as he grabs his chest
Then we watch him bleed through his fingers
Now come on, come all, but if all come all fall, fuck all y'all
We road dawgs, then I come gunnin', niggas runnin' like they sold y'all
In the heat of the night, the (?) static we start up
Guards up, while we come strapped they come ready to mob up
[Chorus 2 w/ 1]
If it's static, one of my niggas gon' get two niggas
Two of my niggas gon' get four niggas
Four of my niggas gon' get more niggas
That's more triggers meaning more killers
You muthafuckas better mob up
[Repeat]
[Liffy Stokes]
It's a static, it's automatic, so grab the automatics
And pumps and pull the triggers and make some niggas look acrobatic
I was cold but frantic, the foes have panicked
They got bloods blew out their dome, bet the bullets run rapid
I kept bustin' for the love of hustlin' squeezin' my wesson
Ruger, gang (?) maneuvers, niggas wanna be bruisers but I'm a shooter
Fuck the squad, because when it's said and done
Liffy Stokes will do some poppin'
[Short Skit]
[Liffy Stokes]
Nigga the devil's knockin' at your fuckin' door
With some hot ones and toe
And ready to hit 'em with nothin' less than four
Nigga let me go, I'm 'bout to pop this bitch
You know you know the lick, art of the mobsta click
Fuck the argument, mob elite's runnin' up apartments
Kickin' in doors pistol whippin' hoes be heartless
Searches as the bullets marches between your arches
Make one call and wait and reload the cartridge
[Chorus 2 w/ 1] - (2x)
[Mayz]
You can't even mess with a mobsta, nigga, is you sick in the head
I torture that ass and have you overdosing on lead
Or maybe I just leave you cut up, drippin' and dead
With your crew skippin' town scared, my lead gon' lead their ass red
Don't get misled, don't mistake me for somebody but a soldier
The elite niggas got more death than AIDS and ebola
Getting old and colder
I be quick to (?) start uppin' but that chip off your muthafuckin' shoulder
[Twista]
Behold the stack folder, gun holder, AKA blunt roller
Mayz if I die for you get your (..?..) and trap holder
To hurt particular niggas comin' with perpendicular figures
Crushin' triggers, y'all niggas better bring back some memos
[Mayz]
It really don't matter if that nigga pack a glock or a gauge
'Cause whatever the fuck Mayz blaze gon' make him see his last day
Takin' 'em out, my life and makin' sure his cast stays
Jack 'em for his last days, that's how livin' fast pay
Nigga, you know the word on the street
It's the mobsta elite that's servin' the streets to the rockin' these beats
You better have a nice way to greet us than rolling with your guys
And you could still die in a multiple homicide

Mobsters reign, we hope you feel this
Speedknot Mobsters
Verse 1:
My click been strugglin half a lifetime tryin to get our shit on
got no G's to sit on, even so niggas sell packs to get on
but let me take you to a place
where these niggaz learn to better pain and stress
look a murderer in the face, comin up with a wilder range you're blitzed
1, 2, 3, and to the 44, the good, the bad, and the ugly sticken you
fleein through the front door, and we gotta do one more
even though dealer watchin me like the lottery
we can still fulfill this westside oddessy mobster prophecy
Well mobbin what can be better than weed, drinks, bitches and loot?
hangin off 20 G's cause you got more money to scoop
lives a hustler by nature, fiend for paper, schemes and capers
constantly eyed by neighbors, who do the Feds favors?
it aint no major dough, what this lady yeya blow
as long as its payin me for my occupation criminal
pullin up on hoes, as the weed smoke blows, the absence of a mobsters presence
is the reason she chose, as the regency rolls, it rolls, the pearl white O's
mobile, shit im a ride high til i die, get killed
smoke like fields, forever dodgin blue shields,
we're blue steel i got full proof escape skills
we're paper chasin leavin trails of shell cases
and chasin to the part of your body
where the bloods wasted, on the life taken
Chicago aint a city its a nation
its all this my foundation within the mobster organization
Chorus:
If its gonna be shakin it up, if its gonna be cookin it up
if it aint hustlin and we got some skunk we gonna be smokin it up
(well I'm a payin mobster for life, caught with gold and ice)
(Speedknots roll two shots too cold to die, know im a get high)
its an everyday thang for my Speedknot Mob to hang
callin cops for thangs, readin to squab or bang
takin your riches, cause we know we snatchin your bitches
the wish I reign my family gotta maintain , its a mobster thang
Verse 2:
Im a fat booty fuckin, love gettin the sucks in and bustin
givin niggers punkin heads for nothin, while bumpin, handle my functions
my pistles pumpin, got hoes jumpin, a mobstas always into somethin
I can feel Killuminati lookin over my shoulder
somethin keeps tellin me to get mine before its over
smokin on plenty of buddahs, the brand to get blessed, with forgiveness
for the last time I'm sent on the survivin quest
from hustlin 24-7 to makin niggas get undressed
The mobster in me got to be obsessed
with lucci and success, so I can care less
if I gotta be lootin and woopin,
I'm sick of beggin niggas for rides
id rather be the one thats scoopin
cause in these last days its day to day hustlin for me, i wont rest here
everyday
fat ass chain and 3 blades,
trippin on that 2 faced, that nigga sweatin dick
while i rock the stage,
like these bitches is just tryin to get paid to give a nigga AIDS
like I can use it for turnin tricks
or either for hittin licks and then rap about the shit
in one the mobster's greastest hits,
and when we come to your town(?)then raise it
finest skunk we just can roll it up and blaze it
Chorus (2x)
Im gonna make it through this New World Order if i gotta be rappin and robbin
you cant stop the Speedknot from mobbin and if you try we squabin
we waitin for you to fall off the square so you best keep your head up
when these shots how niggas roll, cause we dont believe in goin head up
On this week 100's, 50's, and dubs, trigger finger itchy with snubs
hit me wit love, black gloves, red eyes (?)
t-shirt up on my face, fucked up and ready, I cocked the 380,
got a grip that was steady adrenaline
rushin po-feddy, while lives is rolled with Sisqo
may we rock the tightest flows but tinto up with the clips though
gotta find out what yo pockets hit fo, cause i aint that scummie
mother fuck (?) got no time for rockin,
choppin in the car stoppin with a stack ofpacked money
but you trustin me, then I cup this shit,
snatch all of your luxury, try touchin me
actin tough as shit, my moms is a bust for me
fuckin me or make me hate you,
permanently sedate you, when the bullet penetrate
you its goin straight for your face you, unless we chase you
when we escape through your pockets
by all means neccesary the rest is secondary
comin for back til my flesh is buried, the test is carried for me to survive
and hope we still will be thick, with a trilogy click but now seven
mobstability shit
Chorus(2x)
Ha, I just take a pull in the hail,
thinkin about my niggas thats locked up in jail
my mind dwells on crime sales, we wipin off mad shells
only time will tell if we gotta use em'
aint lookin for stack , but if we got into it
we gotta do it, ha, mobster anthem for life

[Liffy Stokes]
the stress of everyday living is slowly corrupting my soul
Im 2 months out the joint on papers walking with 3 years parole
I did 4 and a half a slab and shit a nigga was dying
I'm finally back in the world and its hard but I'm still trying
not to fall and risk my freedom again trying to ball
while waiting for this pussy ass job to call
and it ain't hopping
got me tipping to hear them things popping
cash bags dropping
with plenty of cane for recopping oppurtunity knocking
its what I'm on
I cry when I'm at home cause I'm alone
24 years and grown with a future unknown
my heart was torn from the pain of being back in the game
but I'd rather die getting my hussle on and live like a lane
so its back to pistols and cane
plotting on licks hitting stains
the mob life runs through my veins
its too late for me to change
these streets got me deranged
strapped up and paranoid
ready to add on situations I can and can't avoid
plus big voices getting hot
they constantly sneaking on blocks
they trying to bring me in unconscious
but them pins got popped
now they got me on the run
cherishing every last breath
but I ain't going back
its freedom or death
that be my motive for murder
[begin CHORUS]
[Liffy Stokes]
now I know you the judge of life and death
I ain't evil or nothing
but somebody done brought me pain and sorrow
so I'ma have to kill something
let me count the ways that I can repent
trying to stay holy and focused
but that evil in his eyes let me know that nigga too bogus
that be my motive for murder

I'ma survive these streets another day
I know the pain in my heart won't go away
these mother fuckers try to murder me
and won't nobdy hurt my family
thats what he gotta die

9 times out of 10 you can find Mays trying to hit a better lick
if it ain't coming up with the dopest shit

is equal to povertys bottomless pit
where bitch niggas trick
and thirsty mother fuckers beat you out of everything you get
but it seems like everybodys trying to make some type of come up quick
before its too late to get straight
and the most I make is final pick
anywhere they shit like riding slick
with a thick chick slobbing your dick
even if it means fighting these niggas in cases
as long as neither ones thick
cause I swear when I get hit
I go in a crucial rage like a flick
turn straight lunatic
making all these bitches niggas hear their final tick
but that don't mean my minds sick
just cause I'm motivated by a lot of cheese
when trees by the p's
and fuckin fine fee's and 3's with ease
for sho the skilled poets
within in the mask up kill for it
I'll whoop a fiend with a crushed grill
I'll bet his dumb ass'll stil blow it
bullshit ain't nothing
I'm trying to get this first mil in the bank
and drive a bullet-proof hummer tank
so the next haters who try to air me out come up blank
and I'ma have to sacrifice your life
with a wrath thats stronger than christ

how I'ma hide love from this mark

had to put a slug in his heart

my boy was young and ambitious
took his dreams and wishes
try to do right but my attitude like blast them bitches
drowning all my sorrows in bottles of yack
and a quarter ounce of dro want a rap
I'm bout to snap
here come the big pay back
looking up on the dresser for the black and gray strap
I'm crying and shit
I was hurt so bad I felt I had to go kill him
even if a slug hit him
I was still hurt enough to aim at myself and die with him
can't control them pains
now its time to throw them thangs
visions of the stud don't stay
empty the clip of am out right
ambulance come around
by the time the hypes
taking of his nikes
I know it sound cold
but this bullet put a hole in my soul
?never shorties years stole?
he was only 17 years old
and at the funeral I got to watch his mama's tears roll
and I know he used to wild sometimes
carry a 9 but you took away your sunshine
no more reminising on the fun times
balling and coming at bitches with blunt lines
but this nigga ain't going to want mine
for the pain I'ma handle this funk and dismantle this junk
fuck all that
in all black and then pumped
to run up on this nigga
tip up on him then jump
mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
eyes gleam with the fury
never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers
in front of a prosecuting team and a jury
how did one murder turn into 2
revenge had me shooting thorugh hate
I couldn't stop
in the mist of the action
is when that little ? got shot
all because of my motive for murder

to run up on this nigga
tip up on him then jump
mission to kill armed with a fist full of steel
eyes gleam with the fury
never thought I'd be facing to 2 mothers
in front of a prosecuting team and a jury
how did one murder turn into 2
revenge had me shooting thorugh hate
I couldn't stop
in the mist of the action
is when that little ? got shot
all because of my motive for murder

Right well check it out
[Turtle Banxx]
What's up with you miss?
Your lovely lips got me fiending for one kiss
I'm having fits just to be close to you
Give me once chance I'll make the most of you
What lovers supposed to do
Henny on ice a toast to you
I know how ya approaching, scheming on them noticeable thighs
and that innocent look in ya eyes
I know ya tired of them crooked guys
You know the type cheating just to get the prize on one night
and when the sunlight hits ya sexy alters
Mr. Heartless is in the darkness quicker than a loaded cartridge
I know you feel like a target (look here)
Don't bury your head like an ostrich (hey)
He gonna get his regardless, meanwhile lets hit the market (yeah)
Sitting hot dinner on the carpet
I feed you strawberries and chocolate in my apartment
[Chorus - Turtle Banxx, Johnny P]
[T] In my apartment, slip into your sexy garment
Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling

I know you skeptical on dating based on your past relations
but I got patience plus I'm waiting on the right occasion

Alone to see ya face and be bracing with every kiss
I'm hating the time we missed the fellas don't understand
It don't matter them are boys and I'm a man
Your boyfriend Buddy you calling him husband
When you not looking he trying to holla at ya cousin (thought he wasn't)
Play like it ain't nothing cant disguise the hurt in your eyes
Late nights I hear your cries for loving

Is it alright if I lay you down what what
Cause if it's ok we can play in my apartment
[Turtle Banxx]
Street hustling now became thangs of the past
Money at last again help me baby channel this anger
Ready to blast at oppositions
They don't give me the chamber
I talk the strangest cause my homies only want paper
Don't get me wrong I won't put you in danger the nature of the streets
Ready to claim another life asking God to save us forgiven hearts
The tamers the youth is hard to train em
They only want money and cars status and stars living ghetto famous
Ain't this the shamest lets resolve the changes so they won't be namest
Broke starving and banging
like that old saying home is where the heart is gods will gods will

Candle lights and music set the tone now convince me darling
[P] Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Got ya feeling buzzed off the Hennesey
Tell ya girl that you wanna ride with me
Meet me out front in my six fo' fo'

And when ya man ask where you've been

Yeah, y'all ready to ball, are y'all really ready to ball?
It's the Twista, EA Sports 2004, NBA Live
And you know how it go down, check it
[Chorus: Twista]
You think you're too cold but I
Think you need to go and grab
Your favorite squad
Put your warm up suit on
Cause we about to get our hoop on
[Verse 1: Twista]
In this game ain't nobody colder
When I post to Pippen and I be picking with the cross over, two times over
When I'm floating over your shoulder
I'm the reason why you sounding like a lost soldier
But I'm alright
Representing, I'll be hooping with the Knicks all night
Rather be producing with Houston
And running with Spree
And plus, thinking that Antonio McDyess
He's so nice with the peel
I'm a stay fly when I kick it and switch it to A.I. in Phillyville
Miss it and we right and he will
And he got no skills and it be a guarantee that he go grill
And win everytime
Brother got to get with Kobe
Especially if the game is on my mind
Shaq up in the paint
With Fisher and Horry dropping treys
And Devean George hurting them all the time
Got them crying like a baby
Minnesota got them fast Mercedes, I put them asleep with big K.G
If I got the Sacramento Kings, or Mike Bibby
It will be impossible for you to fade me
I play the game, fully in control
Hit me with some three's and I'm a take it to the hole
EA Sports 2004, NBA Live, if you didn't, now you know
But I know

but dont want the peace signs unless its in the mind
become a victim because i kick em sick em
supposed to be black but they be wack
those who pretend to be a muslim i gooshed em
positive ones i pushed em
into the path or righteousness might get dissed
those who pump a fist but aint right with this
i increase rhymes wacks and weak minds
if it aint real stop throwin up peace signs
[chorus 2x]
dont give him no peace sign if you dont mean it from your heart
untied we can get over, yet were still apart
terror wished em ima terrorize elorize in disguise
those for side for tizin and i begin
to creepin seepin thought out unrighteousness and dissed
connect of venomous gangs with the rhytmness
figured they manifestin g i can address
individually each emcee is throwin up peace but dont pray to the east
i write the lect the soul should be playin towards mecca
but snakes and devils wont letcha

lets walk the path of a vo-cab-ulary
you'll cary the thoughts of every righteous man
lets fight this plan of a other man

blackness dont try to attack this fact this lets now practice
true peace new salon one who is a peace
cease when you see hunger than give peace
blacks a supplied them and applied them identified them

cuz you did not follow the path that i layed out

[Liffy Stokes]
I hang wit pullers of automatic triggers and gold diggers
My mob's full of go getters
Go live or die by the cold niggas
Wit drama bringers ear ringers and pistol slingers with itchy fingers
Getting high on inhaling nigga smoke that lingers
Buck wild hostile we verbal barrels threw nostrils
My hollow point apostles turn living flesh into fossils
It's through gospel niggas will wet it vick Malif'll shred it
Beef on these streets only gets the best of you if you let it
[Malif]
Well it's that Westside nigga from K-Town always gonna stay down
Lay pounds on the table, smoking while watchin cable
I'm able to lick the shot from the porch of my block
And when the gun spray stops there's no information for cops
Nigga I'm heartless some say I role wit the forces of darkness
But the closest I burned to death is the reason that I spark this (Spark this what)
Dramafied premeditated homicide that coincides with the day you die
Cause G, I'm about to let it ride
[Chorus 2x]
Petty niggas down when the bullets fly,
no remorse your fuckin wit a mobsta
For fuckin wit a mobta
If you got your shit right then run and hide,
cause I got a slip quick clip on the side
For fuckin wit a mobsta
[Turtle]
Fuck the car jack we do a body snatch
Tie niggas up in the trunk wit them rats like a mac for owning scratch
SpeedKnot's unstoppable muderin as many niggas as possible
Makin heaven a hospital, and where I'm from it's highly probable
In a Benny reefa roller street patroller stackin clips for lethal loadin
In the city where secrecy's golden
Live or die in the Chi, we kill demeanors wit inferred beamers
Death is the sinner
whether the Reaper awaits your fate with your soul on his finger
[Mayze]
Nigga you can't retreat
When the Mobstaz greet you with bullets like Robert De Niro on Heat
And makin killin look sweet
See a nigga like Mayze break the safety I hold the clip 'till infinite
To show your definite when I make you cry blood like I broke your virginity
Shit my Mobstaz is straight cheat vs. killers for cash
Quick to stick your ass and flash this 3-80 and rainbow macs
And now you thinking of bringin that bull shit in this direction
Just cause you rap a lot don't mean you can't get a lethal injection
[Link]
Picture Link the mercenary fuckin you like missionary
Position them missile carriers precision 'till them bitches buried
But a mobstaz sip on Sherries snitch niggas sing like canaries
Where we wrong be carrying clone Periyon and Herringbone
We on the streets in territory we chill come and get you chest pealed
Hot steal and banana clips standing on tip you get your flesh filled wit rhinos
Energies feel for my soul they holdin captive
Visions of living strengthy posses me lets make it happen
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Smokin on sweet reef for the beat freak
Cause it's in the heat seaker of the street sweeper
Think I'm lying if you want shit is deadly as slugs
Got you swimming in the blood like sea creatures
Cause you done lit to the land of the lost
where our straps looking as pretty as bitches
But pullin up in a hearse to a church is the curse of these hideous witches
Hittin hoes wit, 44's and four by fours wit the pain of a figure four
Wounds hit you like a hit will blow
Every nigga on this track I'll pull a trigger for
If you test the rock vest, pullin slugs like a lockness
I'm a for show protect my chest
Everything in holes is what I unload and not less
Until meals make progress
Y'all niggas no who y'all be never let me see your face in my spot
While you still be facin your block I'ma be erasing you block
Snappin off like Jason on rocks tastin your knots
Cause when it's pockets for profit
I can't stop it this mob got me
If you ain't gonna pop it don't cock it
Cause if we working you, ready to us carrying clips that's reversible
Takin all our business personal diss wit a verse we all hurtin you
Bull shit aside, (Niggas is knowin I fill another wit holes and not hide)
Better role if not ride unless you hoes don't got pride
No remorse when your fuckin wit a SpeedKnot Mobsta
[Chorus 2x, variation on last 2 lines]
If you got your shit right then run and hide
Cause I got a slip quick clip on the side and drop ya
For fuckin wit a mobsta

None of y'all can hang [repeated]
[VERSE 1]
Hype! You better pipe down, or a fight's found
I know you can tear the mic down - huh, sike, clown
Say I'm phony like Christmas cause I twist this
Diss and hiss this, I'm pissed, come and kiss this
Butt of mine, you ain't but a blind muthafucka
Duck tail, one tail, dum tail, try to run, snail
Untangle your dreadlock, I mean deadlock
I'ma rock and hope your ears get the point like Mr. Spock
Them sucker wack rappers whippersnappers think I'm new to this
I been true to this, give me somethin to chew to this
Like bubble gum bums that think I can't hum to a slow drum
Don't think I know where I come from, dumb-dumb, uhm -
I flow to rhythms of all sorts, different sports
Give me some pants with them hands, I ain't takin shorts
Tired of them tiny turds and nerds, absurd words
I think I rock too quick, cause at my pace they ain't heard words
But I know one thang
None of y'all can hang
None of y'all can hang
None of y'all can hang [repeated]
[VERSE 2]
My style I kick, ""You're flowin too quick""
That's what I hear from the vicks
I bet I don't flow as quick as you lick chicks
Please, think I'm sweater than peas? I flick em like fleas
At ease, and even overseas they flip over these
Scall, I break em like a fall, my lead stops em all
I put em in headlocks, dreadlocks and all
I'ma scuff vicks with lyrical ruff tricks
Tuff kicks, put em at the end like a suffix
You better maxwell and get smart
Cause I'ma flow and kill em and let the angels play the harp
I'm sharp, Tung, I be rollin like bicycles, I slice pickles
Should I say cucumbers, newcomers, I flip em like nickels
And dimes, cause nickel-and-dime rhymes I find from blind minds
This time they all wanna diss mine
Why? Because I let the funky lyricals fly like this
Come get with the lyrical manifest that'll be flowin, and I
Rock, they still wanna diss a pro because of my quicker flow
You suckers get played like a piccolo
And I let you know one thang
None of y'all can hang
None of y'all can hang
None of y'all can hang [repeated]
[VERSE 3]
Check, hope you're ready, singers, for steady ringers
And humdingers, bum slingers cut from Freddy's fingers
Slice, nice, twice: he sliced ice and sliced mics with spice
So precise, don't sacrifice, take my advice
Jihad is on the twelves turnin giants to elves
Puttin twelves on the shelves, makin em hate themselves
Cuts like his, you lack that
Records were tossed, and then he crossed the fader like a black cat
Holdin the beat like a hostage
Think it's a joke? Try to poke, then suckers get smoked like a sausage
DJ Jihad be stickin cats
Turnin em sucker ducks' cuts into chicken scratch
...get the catch?
Suckers' hearts are ripped apart
For tryin to get with the god Jihad
Punk, that wasn't smart
Yo, ain't it a damn shame?
None of y'all can hang
None of y'all can hang
None of y'all can hang [repeated]

Blood clot, I do not know
Why suckers say too fast I flow
'Oh' be the reply, I don't see why
It don't be fly just like a slow flow
Because I still can rock a show
Oh, the party jumps, I make the party jump
I pump the fist like this
With funky hypeness
And oh, I take you far, god
The dope Chicagod can rock a show well
Because I flow well, so won't ya go tell
I'm at the show where they do not respect Chicago MC's
I make them freeze like frozen chimneys
Step on the stage with my stage crew
Grippin the mic like Crazy Glue
And after that then what do I do?
Begin to drop, my funky hip-hop
They start to flock, my funky hip-hop
Their brains'll lock, my funky hip-hop
The way I rock, my funky hip-hop
Hip-hop, I rock the show

I gotta flow - oh, 1 down, 2 2 go

Steppin up into a dancehall
I tell em, ""Dance y'all""

I pump the fly rhyme that be my rhyme
That I'ma rock in the funky party with
They think I won't, but watch how fly the party get
They follow me, follow me, black, I'm not wick-wack
They follow me, follow me, black, I'm not wick-wack
MC's be ever so angry cause I step in the fortress
Then I rock the party because I rock everybody
They follow me, follow me mic chants
I tell the men 'say ho', they say 'ho'
Follow me mic chants
I tell the men 'say ho', they say 'ho'
A victim of the way I kick them flows
I chose 10 bros I picked from 10 shows to rock the 10 toes
I make the rhythm rough enough to make the feet scuff
Across the floors and rock them dirty drawers
I see your sweat pours, ya step with no flaws
I rock the second show with cuts like chainsaws
The mic is yours
I rock the 2nd show
2 down, 1 2 go [8X]

Me comin to flo-ow, oh-oh
It's time to rock a 3rd show
Flo-ow, oh-oh, it's time to rock a 3rd show
Me stamina rocks again
The tick-tocks of clocks again
Drops the men, they need some oxygen
If suckers think I'm wack I call em out like bingo
Or oo-uno cause I do know hip-hop judo and you know
The hip-hop chops rocks akis, don't drop no abc's
Cause I only drop these to drop knees
Please, dis a Chicagod, ya lose
Cause I can rock with stars and still get ahs and oohs
And voodoos choose to put me on tours, I rock like this
I rock a male and rock a female, ay y'all, pump the fist
Because I be rockin the funky words and cheers are heard
That be the 3rd show - 3 down, no mo' 2 go

Fuck what the punks are talkin bout
I wanna get up with that big ballin bitch
plus niggaz feelin what I'm on as well
Blunts got my mind in the zone
The one that's rocking fresh Pelle Pel's
True to the shine on his bone
Somebody beatin up the block on fresh rider rims
If it's me hell, you can tell by the design on the chrome
Crying on the phone
Hoe thinkin I'm in love with her
cause she took me shoppin and had me tryin on cologne
So I left her on the line with the tone
Got up with this other bitch
Brought no weed cause she firin up her own
So hurry with the Phillie bitch, I'm really sick
off of some illy shit
Here go a rusty razor blade, but still it split
and fill it with the killer shit so I can really trip
It's like the bud was tailor made for milli-clips
and mac-10's, I lit the bead from the back end
Straight to the chest and it got me sprung
My lungs started collapsing - shit nigga what's happenin?
The sess got me trippin off the drums and guns, ready for action
Duck and swang on either upper thang
Try to be tougher, bang, scuff and hang
Suffer pain, left deranged then youse a bogus m'uhfucker mayn
System be struck a vein, I'm too strange
for m'uhfuckers to compete with
I'm on some infrared heat shit
with a deep clique, what I eat sleep shit
Well if it's a freak bitch, she can suck a sweet dick
til she's seasick; blockin niggas out like an eclipse
When smokin them devils put your hands together
like you know the host
Cause ain't no nigga that can resist the words from the Twist'
Leavin niggas comatose from my overdose

I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it
Me overdosin on weed and sendin all y'all off into a thang

I done put the fuel on it, take a pull on it

Kill off all enemies while makin G's, catch you off on your knees

Can you figure out the cause and effect?
Niggas comin on your set
Thugs comin out they drawers with a tec
Victim bleedin from the neck
Shirts is getting wet, shorties yellin threats
Lookin for the one who called for the deck
Now they airin out the hall in the spot
Hitting stomachs leavin niggas pinched up
Bodies balled in a knot
Bullet holes in the wall from a glock
Searchin for the one who called in the shots
Hypes crawlin for rocks
Goin all in the socks of the recently deceased
from what was released
From the chrome beast to the dome piece
Visions in my mind bein increased by inner beef
with some grief, but when I chief on some strong leaf
I'm snappin hard enough to make a nigga try to check his own chief
Violate him but can't annihilate him
Pickin up his own teeth and it's on with the microphone deep
Stimulate him with pistols penetrate him
Nerves still jumpin cause adrenaline pumpin is a m'uhfucker
Hit him with the steel bloodsuckers
Murdered the bud lovers makin sure every one of you hoe studs suck us
And I bullshit you not if it was full clips, two glocks
you would still die or you'll get too hot
Cause when my fuel kick you'll drop
Hypes is trickin on you
Tell me where he at bitch and you'll get two rocks
(Okay!) Cause when my tool click you'll pop
Can't this hype nigga stop shit, I'm hazardous
Makin musical miracles like I'm Jesus of Nazerath
Yet disasterous, smokin on halves and hash, fuck if it's cancerous
Bust ass to the beat cause I mastered this
It's hard to breathe, I'm bustin like an A-bomb
cause I'm in the zone, twenty-two a cold shit up my sleeve
It's hard to stay calm thinkin about the bitches that I'm fin' to bone
Hittin my enemies and competition up with lethal blows
that's damagin, flows that's callous and we're leavin
thick ladies frantic and people in the industry panickin
I thought we got in this to get out of pistol handlin
Now it's possible m'uhfuckers could start vanishin
Fuck the Anacin I be toking plenty and stankin from stress
and flowin over notes; them studs thinkin they can get close
I know I got you trippin off the shit
a nigga said off a overdose

[Twista]
C'mon and toke on a dub with me; I love cities with parties
that's full of bitches where they let me rub titties
Be able to pack a snub with me; in case we get in some static
and gotta start leakin blood from stud skinnies
So don't ask if it's the bud in me; because for some reason
I smoke on some weed and get too wicked and raw
It can't be nickel or soft the way it's chokin me
potency'll have me rockin mics
and givin your bitch dick in the jaw, I'm hookin the law
You're lookin in awe, took what you saw
Got the B's pen and pad out the bottom drawer
Then got to bitin and formulatin some shit you called your own
but take it to the rehab cause you got a flaw
To put it simple you ain't cold enough
Trippin out like you can't control the stuff
Lackin rhythm like you known to bust
In a different zone from us
You niggas need to sit the fuck down
get a swisher and roll this up
If you think I'm speakin too bold, whassup?
I ain't even on no hoe shit; plus the mob is so thick
I'm the type of nigga you should wanna get up close to
and take a smoke with
If there's static then check yo' clique; my mind is so sick
I be tweakin with speakin releasin energy to show I know the ropes
Cause when it comes to this rap shit
niggas will choke til I'm ghost
while I breath reefer smoke from my overdose
Try to put me to the test, gimme some buddha bless
I'll show you who the best
Release the vocal trilogy..
[Traxter] Aight T god damn slow it up mayn!
M'uhfuckers done felt you mayn! We can go to the next shit
[Twista] God damn man you stoppin muh'fuckers and shit
Man I'm tryin to get my zone on
Let niggaz hear what the fuck I'm doin man
[Traxter] I mean you done zoned man, let's go to the next cut baby
[Twista] Man, fuck that shit

[Liffy Stokes]
You looking chilliy wit yo thick ass
I know you got plenty niggas out there who trick cash
I damn near caught whiplash as you walked pass
Fucked up the blunt ashes
Peepin your script perpetrating you high
Youz a rat in disguise I see the freak in you eyes
You got between your thighs from fuckin to many guys
And yet still you play the sweet role but we know
That you juggle dicks like slot machines at a casino
I'm high as hell so I'm flaotin
Up in the party tokin
A 44 max and nigga don't jack
Cause I blast away fuck up a niggas whole day
Get the wildin and shoot this btich up in the party
Mobsta style you ain't had a thug in a while
I hit her wit the proposition as she's peepin me out
So whats the lick shorty? Fuck the game me or the lane
She hoped in the Range and then her attitude changed
She said ""I know you fool you one of them Mobsta niggas""
""Who rap wit Twista, wheres he at"" fired up wit some liquor
Hold tight shorty we almost at the City Inn
I told Maze about the lick soon as he buzzed me in
[Chorus]2x
Baby if you want to party tonight
then let me see you touch your toes
And show me you a party hoe
I got my niggas you got your girls
cause bitch we fucked the world and how do we hurl
Only if you partying hoe
[Maze]
I gotta confess I think I'm obsessed wit group sex
Yo lets have a contest and see who do it the best
Inside of Nubian flesh make me wanna get undressed
Tap that ass from the back cause baby your bodies blessed
And your friend to she bend too
Bust out some ginseng brew so I can dick your whole crew
That's the shit I'm into pass some pussy to my guys
Put my dick in your mouth shoot the loogy in your eye
I don't wanna socialize I'm just trying to get bucked
So after you get fucked you hoes gotta raise up
Bumpin out just blaze up big ol' B and the T's
Kick off the party wit you and your homies or your knees
While y'all party to see who got the most superb herb
Nigga Stokes gonna stroke that ass wit the killa curb
Till sober and then do it over again
Cause who ever taste the most dick is the one to win
So open them thighs wide while a nigga slide in
Let me see how many different ways your body can bend
Trippin on Liff spinnin your girl like he gonna miss her
While I'm opening the door for my niggaro Twista
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Oh gody what a sexy body you likes to party bitch come on get bucked
I gots to get some if I can't bust one gots to get fucked
Immaculate love get wit the look up at the ceiling lens
A pen of friends bring the Rhemy in I'm sinner sinning sin
Come up inside surprise pour Heny in a glass
Pretties is fast I'm glad squeezing tities and ass
Freakin at last Maze and Liff happy ever so horny
And one of them bonin what I'm gonna do now all of them want me
They slobbin and bobbin steady mobbin and globbin
like they slob whenever they party
But this big fat thick bitch made my dick hard
No that its swollen she choking
while her cheeks parted open the bitch started stroking
And I'm hoping the girl is hot and soakin, play wit her emotions
Talk about a Chi-Town po pimp
Let's flash the gold and wether or not get the dough gotta grab fo fin
Mo' freaks came thinking I don't want 'em I show
I got a gun, put you mouth around my scrotum and hold 'em
And catchin me bring that ass to me I have to see
Maze broke after me all of us going Ugh!! like Masta P
Boys is laughin cause we got the girls partying up
How they get fucked stroll to Bobby's we grab the shoties and bust

[chorus]
I thank God that I found my piece of mind one more time
Since I'm dyin' I'd rather go right now than to be waitin' in line
[REPEAT]
[verse 1]
play with mine you'll find that it's the wrong damn move
I was the wrong damn dude
Gino told me do the usual leave him in critical
my brother Bruce told me that he didn't pay dues
you snooze and lose
so what I'd do is make this man take a bath in his shoes
and it was all on the news
see I knew that it would be that me or him gonna bleed
and it wasn't gonna be me
so what I did was popped one up in my chamber and I sent 3
no women no kids
and I'ma shine on this nigga like Mop 'N Glo
you think he stopped and load
he jumped down with the rocks and a bomb on a dope
but he didn't have to be so bold
he rushed the Mob like a blob with the glocks and more
and even called the cops on Sko
he be shitty chi with the diamond in the watch in the coat
the medallion to match with the rope
no cars and the trucks in the cars that he ride
lookin' like a star when he glide
I swear to God when he hear the bullet fall through the sky
he be jackin' like a rabbit tryin' to hide
kinda hard to catch a nigga who be gone in the wind
purple Navigator and a Benz
a new ??, the old niggaz that he used to fuck with
took a fall for strength of a man
[verse 2]
(Sko get it) before I step outside and do my job for Allah
pray to Allah, undo Allah
anythang go wrong I pray to Allah
anythang go right I give my praise to Allah
anythang in sight I'ma bless for Allah
everythang tonight I'ma test for Allah
everythang you write I'ma erase yo bar
if you ridin' tonight you better hop out yo car
cause the moon tonight is traced in 5-star
I feel for ? my sisters at the bar
y'all be aight just keep yo self to yo self
y'all can see aight out on the streets it's double dare
over there it's the end of the road East 99 find my kind
still blind to the times and the signs
on the streets niggaz killin' elites
killin' ??
killin' the chief
5 stars in the governor
everybody gettin' covered up
wrapped up in some bloody sheets
I came off the deep saw throw my heart
niggaz slangin' a V with the L's on his way all the time
since I'm dyin' then I'd rather go right now
than to be waitin' in line
[chorus]
[verse 3]
I cant seem to get away from all the things in the world that bring me down
and I cant seem to get away from all the pressures
and the pain that I find myself around
but I need a little more time for me to survive
all the dirty things that I did in my life
I can walk by I can try to crawl by I can run
but I cannot hide from my piece of mind
I hit him clean in the middle of his dentures
he was getting carried away because I let him slide
a couple times he went off on an adventure
bloody murderer only to die it the Darkside
and god I like to for killin over some Benjamins
but it wasn't about my money it was bout his pride
he had to run to the van he was defending it
in a line of duty he died for a piece of mind
I never knew I would have to murder the motherfucker
I was the one fighting and piecing and increasing the peace
I could (?) hit me and my brother
we was the reason for a record that cd release
we B.I.B. to the avenue about the trigger time
you can't be alive in the hood when we dirt ride
and motherfuckers got down cause never could
never survive with the goods that god provide
so as I bogus wack him for doing my job
eliminate niggas that hate cause they ruining the mob
I choose got bruise when I toss that guy out in the squad
while they flossing the cars we busting and turn into god

Do you wanna riiide?
In the backseat, of a Caddy
Chop it up, with Do or Die
Do you wanna riiide?
In the backseat, of a Caddy
Chop it up, with Do or Die
Verse One: Belo
Seven double oh P.M.
Fly low to them hoes in the B-M
Sippin Seagram, chewin on a weed stem
Touchin on my fo' fin
Move it to the back so I can see who beepin this Po Pimp
Spring to the phone with a slow limp
In a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10
Three line connection
As the rest of them wanted affection
Just bring the weed, we got the drinks you need
And plus we strapped with two protections
I put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute
Cause I forgot where I met the hoe
And the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap
I straight up check the hoe, really doe
To the crib
Chorus
Verse Two: AK-47, Belo
Seven deuce five, the ride the point to spot the live hoes
Three miles per hour
Like we runnin up on some ri-vals
Never to deny though, these bitches look fly 'Lo
Introduce myself
A to the motherfuckin K finna recognize
Then I loose myself juice myself
As you take one pull, uhh, pass it to the left and umm
Self-centered niggaz'll take two pulls
cuz they thinkin about samplin umm
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We learnin these hoes biology, and obviously, well...
Mmm, ain't this some shit, pull up in the C-A
D-I, Double-L, with ah A-C, A-C hoes
They peep those, P-I, M-P, and they think that automatically
Cause he's a pimp, he gotta be, full of that
M-O, N-E, but why?
Cause nigga be sportin nice cars and fancy clothes
Fresh jewels Girbaud flexin one five oh (chop chop)
Chop up that paper hoe, chop up that paper hoe
Watch where your lips go, caress my tip slow
To the tempo, instrumental
Real simple when you fuckin with a pimp doe
Get involved in the backseat
Let's have me in the cab betcha mess with ya young ass
Smokin on that finest grass
Never miss what you never had, at last
P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
We learnin these hoes biology, and obviously, well...
Chorus
Verse Three: Tung Twista
Well a motherfucker might be broke and shit
and then collecting no dough from tips
But I be spittin mo' game than a mouthful of poker chips
to get them hoes with the Oprah lips and the provokin hips
and never gotta tell her many lies
I been lookin in the city skies, get up in the kitty's thighs
cause I'm blessed with a look of innocence, good sex
peanut butter complex and some pretty eyes
Pity cries on my strategy side, yo when outta me gotta be
right, that'd be the flatter me right
But if the head the bonk c'mon suck a nigga dick
Members of my click, wanna see what that'd be like
I know you wanna try it out, to the rhythm of a high hat
Don't be bogus and deny that
I done got a hold of dem my fellas on the train
while she lie back, now motherfucker can you buy that?
Where your ride at?
On the passenger side of your hoe
tryin ta come up on another G
The broad all up under me tryin ta smother me
Lookin love-ly while I roll another bead, suddenly
She learned that I don't deal with emotions
But when we in the room she rubbin me with lotion
Comin like an ocean coastin have a cig thinking
me and Do or Die dig drinkin love potion
The word that was never said
Twisted be givin women dick in the bed, until they sick in the head
And if I ever leave whoever dead
They ain't trickin the Feds or spittin game but it's chicken and bread
Kickin them legs in the air like a playa do
Then belittle in a day or two
After words I'ma slay a crew
Now that's some pimp type shit that B-Low and AK'll do
Wearing gray and blue
If a hoe wanna holler then you a playa if you hit them ends
and get the dividends
But you a pimp if you can get the same hoe to wanna freak your friends
Cause I studied P-I, M-P, ology, but logically
Be learnin these hoes biology, obviously, well...

[Todd Nitty]
Here's the tale of a young black male
raised in these city streets
out here hustling to make ends meet
In a world thats so corrupt
thats ran by greed
money and the power
for me I'm a survivor
I do what I have to and only God can judge me for that
So before you cash your stones down on me
I want you to take a look at yourself in the mirror
And ask somebody to pray for you
Cause that's all I'm asking is to pray for me, understand
I was born around gangstas, hustlers, and killers
Drug dealers with math figures making hella scrilla
In the city of Chi the home of the G's
If ya dont work ya dont eat that's been the code of the streets
As for me I was brought up at an early age
learned how to cook cane started to gang bang
and its a damn shame I chose game
but see I'ma knuckle headed nigga with no one to blame
and I'ma gonna keep on tipping under the street lights
and be wondering which nigga wanna take my life
until then I'm staying two feet in front of you haters
[chorus]
I'm living the street life
and I just cant get away
I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
so everynight I pray
oh I pray
I'm living the street life
and I just cant get away
I dont know if I'ma gonna make it to another day
so everynight I pray
well I'm surrounded by rats, roaches, and dope fiends
my whole world is being weighed up on a triple beam
man I dont know whats in store for me god
will I reach 21
why is life so damn hard
see thats the question thats asked
and is there a heaven or hell can the young black live
or will he be chained in the cell
I don't know as for me I only trusted a few
I had to hustle to survive now what else could I do
they say theres chances for everybody thats bullshit
that little girl had no chance when that bullet hit
I mean it blew to the sky
and all you heard was a cry
oh lord don't let my baby die
[chorus]
Til the day that I die I'll stay true to my neighborhood
fuck with my neighborhood nigga I wish you would
Ain't shit changed like oh once said
And oh no fool my nigga Fred ain't dead
neither is Pook or Kansas City
true og's still here with me
my homie boo, boo what up
and you know I cant forget about my nigga nigga Novesnake
nightime boats and herbie
Shine and Cherelle would ya pray for me
I rock genue death so dam sensless
big houses what the fucking radio been missing
and theres one more nigga that be true to my heart
Mr. Motion you the reason while I'm breaking em off
so our
I peed em to dead
whole reason was love
to that nigga twist for believing in me
I got a shorty to feed
my priority is to make sure this shit dont have to struggle like me
and if I could ask for one more wish
I tell em I wanna hug ya cuz I'm missing ya since

so I'm asking to pray for me
mamma pray for me

Sucker wack vicks, I ratatattat tactics, givin em black kicks
Mufflin up the mic with funky black licks
Tricks, I be rippin em like hocus pocus, focus on the funk, gee
Tung be runnin away like a punk be
Rockin, droppin the funk of the manifestation that'll be dope
Scope the point of being wack? Nope, never & no-no
A dancer like a go-go? Oh no
My lip be sort of kickin sort of funky like a hobo
Sucker, I'm like a hype hip-hop gangster gettin dumb
Instead of shooting guns I shoot the tongue
Style Pacino, I'm gunnin em up controllin your casino
Funky like a wino, rhino-dyno like dino
Comin around the corner cappin sucker ducks who be tryin to wreck mine
But my lyrical tongue is like a Tec-9, wastin em
Look at me spillin juice, loose to chasin em
Cut them like tomatoes, then be tomat-pastin em
Facin em, gun to tongue, let's see who'll win this gang member
I'm droppin em like a leaf in September to November
Froze in December, rock over October, so remember
When I shoot the Tec-9 tongue - timber
Ratatattat

Ratatattat
What's the sound of a gat

Prr-prrrr.. buck em down
Sucker ducks, comin to pluck em down
Hope the hip hype hip-hop horn struck em down
Climbin, I'm never rhymin Simple like Simon but I'ma do what Simon said
He told me to put that head to bed
Givin an eyeful, funky rhythm of a tongue will stifle
Trifle cause I pop the tongue like a rifle
Watch the funky words pounce
From my mouth watch 40 bounce
Cappin a sucker duck like a 40 ounce
Some flows are wack, but as for me I cause a catastrophe
Like callin Allah God steppin to me is blasphemy
I shoot the tongue like a machine gun
Know what I mean, son?
A chunky spunky tongue if you ever seen one
Cops, I give em props, they cap men, mostly black men
Mouth will pack, then smack em like a Mack-10
Bop - another head flown like a frisbee, it is me
The clips from my lips could drop a Grizzly
Hear me vick, I pack a kick for the ballistic, animalistic
You didn't know my tongue was this quick
Cops that be cappin thinkin that be spunky
Watch I hit them with the lyric and then I'm cut em up with a funky
Ratatattat
[CHORUS]
[VERSE 3]
Poppin and poppin and poppin the flow of the hip hype hop rhythm
I bust caps like I've been hittin false teeth with raps
Rip your show apart, I know you got no heart to start, I flow art
I got the style that even Humphrey couldn't Bogart
Syllable serum, suckers hear come a style to smack a man
And it be sort of like a smack of Jackie Chan
I pop the funky gun of hip hop, I hop with hips
Droppin battle ships I put the automatic clips up into my lips
Funky like a drunk, I buck em like a hunter
My rifle will make em stifle like Edith Bunker
Suckers I tag em, my rhythm'll rag em, drag em
They felt the funky flow of the formula .44 Magnum
Minimum against the maximum, cracks a maximus
Charge tax and dust, thinkin about waxin us
DJ Jihad will slice em like lard
Check out the funky cut, rocks god be gunnin em up like buckshots
Cappin a brother if he come in a centimeter
Comin to drop the style of Tung and then I bet I'm gonna beat ya
Shootin like mi Uzi, I re-arrange a fella feature
Filimeter, mi funky rhythm is like a 9 millimeter

Oh - back again makin the rhythm kick jazz
Used to be wick-wack, now I got funky pizzazz
Idryss'll do my fade-up cause he cuts em like class
And the chicks want me to lick cause I'm too quick, I think I'll pass
Dollars, if I don't fold em, I roll em like a bolo
Other steppin to brothers cause he be God? Oh no
G-o-d, I be not he, it's true, don't call me loco
And my man Eric the Wiz will stir the mini mix up like Coco
Cut like Michael Myers, start up fires, I'm a scar hard
Thinkin I be wimpy, I just simply rip em far apart
Ansaars in New York, I know that you know that you are God
This brother's from Chicago, so I guess I'm a Chigagod
Rhythm is my producer of rhythms on the wax
The posse Lower Level be kickin some funky tracks
Never ask, I ax, I get madder than Max

Styles, I hand em, I brand em like cattlecakes
Better get flows from your bros if a battle takes
I hear a hiss, the tale of a taddle shakes
Backs this breaks givin aches to the rattlesnakes
I get spunky with funky stylin
Rhythms I flow, I kick them wild and
Tryin to get with the styles I'm pilin
For your sob story I better get the violin
Come again - watch a fun one construct
I don't like sissy chickens and I hate a sucker duck
Some label me a sucker because ducks I like t pluck
The only way I be a sucker is if women wanna suck
Always goin broke so I don't dig into my stash
I'm cool as Brian Robbins on the show _Head of the Class_
If you don't get the picture, make the camera go flash
When this rhythm was a baby, doc spanked him on his - jaz

Study my culture, soar like a vulture
My teacher Marvin Howard will create my sculpture
I'm kickin Islam, some brothers try to bomb
Facts can harm but I still say Salaam
Sometimes I blush, bust and leave puss
Hush if I must, plus I don't forget to flush
With suckers I fuss, thought I was soft like a slush
Chicagods crush cause they think toys r us
Hip (hip what) hop
This funky hip (hip what) hop
Is funky hip (hip what) hop

'll make a drip (drip what) drop
I like to rip (rip what) shop
I always slip (slip what) cops

By getting in the 50 yard line and bump and grind
We can get our grub on but I ain't spendin' a dime
Except for (..?..) swisses and wine
I wanna drink until we're boozed at the match of playin' (?)
While I'm takin' you to school we can trip and get cool
And talk about how fun it is to break the rules
Then you do these fantasies to try something new
Baby let me sell you the dream and make 'em come true

I got a green broke down for some else to grab
A bitch in school, kicked off the piece and loot
Gettin' derb loverly as we cruise the coupe
Hoes swoop like troops to dive in while I'm drivin'
Got a wave and choosin' a slick nigga who's rotten
Bumpin' it feels good, chokin' on backwoods
With a pocket full of scraps, the sun beams on the wood

This funky tempo I throw, I know that I be slappin the dope hypeness up in em

This style I be throwin to tangle the mind of a sucker
Then label it lyricalism
And scopin em in a prism
And givin a lyrical flow that will fizz em
I tackle a rhythm and break it up, only my lyric was left
My Tung Twista is def first, let me take a deep breath
Flowin the lyrical magic of mine I be moppin and sweepin
And breakin em up and then makin em break in a sweat
I be makin em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kickin and poppin the rhythm I'm rockin and pumpin

And a flow of the rhythm I'm bringin into the mic
I'm gonna give em a concept, never let a con step
To what I be givin the crowd that be makin em hype and then leavin a con swept
Breakin the suckers up into chunks, I be leavin em sinkin deeper than south
I'm gonna twist this up funky, T.T. be runnin off at the mouth

Listen to the tongue twist, twistin is the Tung
Because of my trickery my tongue is slippery
This style is wild I brung
Terrible, tragical, mystical, magical, wreck in a second

You think that I'm sickenin, hoes be kickin when I stick it in

She said she wants some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross, a little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
(Are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are u gonna be, are you gonna be are you gonna be, well well well well well)

I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
Imma bring da cool whip
Then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shine home
Man I swear she fine homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action
My dawg said you aint no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
I'm a play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
Imma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get right

Got you lookin at the gliss at my hands and wrists
While i'm layin back smokin on my canibus
When it come to rockin the rythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you aint no messin with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi and I be

Play some R&B
Tryina smoke a B
Lookin properly
Feelin on a G?
And always (Well Well Well Well Well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm
Smokin on a B
Dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&B
And I got to leave
something to the 23's?
And I do it (well well well well well)
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me

Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin'
Tryina make you moan
And I do it (well well well well well)

It's like I got the 4 4 cocked
On the block in it two door dropped
And my spot is keepin' but hot
The pussy ass cop throw some murder in the lot
My nigga got popped with a bullet that was meant for me
The adapt by T's and B's and the regencies
Fuck what the reason be  I'ma start squeezin' these
Them niggas ain't G's  they wanna be thugs
And it ain't shit  these ain't no muthafuckin' slugs
The fools and plugged plus ain't no hoes over here
I done dropped more dead bodies than tears
Brought to life momma's worst fears
Pictures of a son dyin' from that hot ones flyin'
Baby mama's cryin' at the funeral
'Cause the magnum lit him like a black (?)
When I rolled out on his ass on the solo
I caught him up on mo-mo cookin' up co-co
I got to tip on the low-low
Bust it there like po-po takin' lives with the, oh no
It's a 4-4 many missles with a silent sub for the whistle
My favorite pistol
'Cause when I let that bitch ride
I know the homicide is being counted out, it's official
Niggas steady bumpin' guns, but don't want none
Because of these hot ones that explode on contact
A maniac just prepared to die in combat
Besides all that my 4-4 keeps my laced: Dawg he paid and safe
I can see the fear in your face as I reach my waist for this warm embrace
[Chorus]
I got plenty love for the 4-4
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it go
Because a nigga straight lovin' your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5
But when I pick it up, I don't wanna let it ride
But still I bust 'cause I survive from your warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill
And when I pick it up, I don't really wanna kill
But still I bust because I'm needin' your warm embrace
All you muthafuckas better duck and hide
Before I let it ride, the sucka stepped aside
Still I bust because I'm lovin' your warm embrace
[Mayz]
I love the element of surprise when I'm taking these hoes lives
With my customized 4-5
Get enough ammunition to knock off you, your crew and some more guys
You muthafuckas better get wise
Make sure your first shot is sweet, tryin' to kill the elite
'Cause you ain't gettin' no more tries
Make the nigga's nubian mother weap, but fuck it
As long as I don't get whole cries
Put the beam between his eyes and make that bitch nigga so wise
No matter what the size of the warm embrace of my forty-five
Make sure that nigga crossed me dies
You don't wanna throw them thangs
When I cocked and aim (?) think in these few seconds time
But Mayz ain't new to the game
I use the spark when we start to light up this thunderin' crime
But niggas get bucked for dime and it's like you're a magnet for sin
(?) pretend to be your friend 'til they get close enough to your ends
To do you in, that shit puts me on ten
And make me wanna put the barrel of this solid fiend
Upon under that nigga's chin, plus he talkin' big shit about war
Like he don't know my stee, now mob's gon' win
But I dare one of you niggas to say my name
'Cause I put a fuckin' bullet into your closest skin
Just to get under your skin like a dirty syringe
Plus I know you can't win with a gun or a pin
So when you see Mayz come in the place you better say your grace
Before I fuck up your face like a can of mace
Before I get disgraced, I'ma catch a case
Maybe you hoes fear the wrath of my warm embrace
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Would you (..?..) of the team, for sure
Hold you ever so tightly, I love you nina and never wanna let you go
Miss millimeter's makin' the (?) muthafuckas gotsta be ruckus
When I get my clutches upon this hoe
Itchin' to let the barrel blow
Like a sparrow, how it flow, like an arrow (..?..)
Spit 'em up and swallow slow
I reload, clippin' your ass crack, you constantly blast back
Payback from flashback, some bitches know
Bust 'til I see the chrome from the intro
You was fucked from the phasin', deep with the cuts and abrasion
Erupts and amazin', nigga, my nina bucked
Fuck the gauge and enemies get (?) up from the blazin'
Fool you be burnin' them with your black ass
Murderous hips, hurtin' the grips, ride on personal list
Deposition die for servin' them six
Everyone of 'em with a hit but some are missin' of a jerk to the kick
'Cause I be working my bitch
Tryin' to pimp her but she a wild and a tame thang
Kick a static on when she gangbang, blast in the fullest moon
Niggas better pull it soon or else suffer hellafied bullet wounds
And even though I stay clubbed with some thugs, why call 'em stug
When it comes to (?) run about she draw my blood
Static under the bra 'cause everytime I take a hit at the bud
And give you a hug you gon' pop up a slug
Drinkin' remy on the block, gotta bust the glock
When the henny hit the chest, bustin' smith-n-wess
Fuck the discussion, I'm bustin' 'em all, clutchin' my balls
If I see I'll be laid to rest, let me hit the sex
Lose (?) but used to be a problem solver
But the nina made me a baller
Go strapped and take the place of the black nine
Leave 'em flat lines, feelin' fury, you was born to taste
From my warm embrace
[Chorus]
I got plenty love for the 4-4, 4-4, 4-4
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the 4-5 (4-5), 4-5 (4-5), 4-5
Warm embrace
I got plenty love for the nine-mill (Nine-mill), nine-mill

Intro, I break a, break a brother ten fold
Oh, 10-40, stomp em like a dinosaur
Poor excuse for an MC, so-so singers
The things I bring'll snap like fingers
Rugged hip-hop, I'm gettin funky like a cheap perfume
Doom, take em from the womb to the tomb, whom
It may concern, I return from the mentally dead
To fly a sleep sucker duck's head
A thouroughbred in this talent, I be snappin like I'm coo-coo
Try to fade my spade, you made a boo boo
Suckers say 'ooops', troops, I spank em if they rap happy
Never calm, cause I'm snap happy
[CHORUS]
Am I snap happy? (mh-hm)
Tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
Tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
Yo, tell me am I snap happpy? (mh-hm)
[VERSE 2: Tung Twista]
Snap happy - snappin on those who think I rap crappy
The Tung is snappy, rougher than nappy, you can't outrap me
Punk, with suckers I toy, I'm stronger than a droid
I don't avoid the noid, I destroyed the noid
So I gotta make a scrub pay hay
Suckers I slay, they lay stinkin in the subway
Focus, my rhythm will scrub, say rub-a-dub-dub
Cause I'ma step into em like a bathtub
I make em run like waterfalls, use your eyes for pool balls
Then run through rappers like school halls
I'm breakin sucker punks' backs
Facts on wax, when I step, instead of footprints, I leave tire tracks
My rhythm be delicious while
I flow, the skunk of this, funk of this with a dramatically vicious style
I destroy your phoney hip-hopness like the Lochness
Monster, just because I want ta
1 to 2, I'm comin through
Swig em like a brew, ooh
You think I bit off more than I can chew?
I break a sissy up with no twist
Don't make my tongue flappy
I still can be labelled as snap happy
[CHORUS]
DJ Jihad get loose
[DJ scratches] (Hit me)
[VERSE 3: Tung Twista]
I snap and make em yield
Spin my tongue like a windmill
And crack your skull like a windshield
Show me where a sucker makes a error, I give him terror
Be smooth as Aloe Vera, they run like mascara
I turn em over like a page, engage
I eat em with rage and trap the duck behind my rib cage
Flow, my jock'll make em blow
Want me to take em slow
I flow speed till they can't take no mo'
Get the urge to see what I'm servin, bee
I make an emergency for the sucker to get surgery, word to G
You thinkin what I said'll miss
But I'm the head of this, what I said'll diss
Cause it's a mega-diss
If you sleep get into bed of this
But if you wake up, I'ma fly that dreaded head like Pegasus
I'm a son, but for some reason they wanna call me the rap pappy
I guess it's cause I'm snappy

Now, now, when my boo let me break 'em off, freaky when we makin love
I can do shit to you that'll make you shake in lust
Comin through how I be stoppin off, kinky when I make you cum
How could you wanna do shit that'll make me break the trust?
Shoulda knew you were sheisty the way you lick me on my body
and actin shady when I'm out the crib, lightly
Cause somethin bogus just to fight me spite me all in my area
plus I'm a Sagittarius, you a Pisces
For some reason we be clickin like we on business
but you be on some bullshit
Askin me where I go, what I do, how I kick it
Won't you get with it baby girl, I don't cheat on you and pull shizz
Now who don't wanna roll on, chrome with then go home with
Get you to the crib, give you some grown dick
I let you hold my pounds down, purchasin you phones and fits
How many times I told you, I ain't known shit
But you steady don't listen even though it's your friends that listen
Gotta have trust, but you won't back up on a couple I'll catch you wishin
Claimin that I'm fuckin on another bitch and
all in my privacy on no premonition, you trippin
Tell me why do you - doubt a brother, in one ear and out the other
Cause in my shirt you done found number
You steady lurkin while I was up in the shower
dumpin all of my pants pockets, trippin cause you done found a rubber
And all I gotta say is.

That's not right (that's not right)
Snoopin through my things (you snoopin baby, snoopin baby)
I don't do it to you (I don't do it, I don't do it)
You shouldn't do that to me (I don't do it to you)
That's not right (that's not right)

I don't do it to you (and I sho' wouldn't do it)
You shouldn't do that to me (I ain't gon' do it to you)

I was sittin in the front just watchin videos
Readin my magazine, my Vibe magazine, yeah
I coulda sworn that I turned my damn 2-Way off
But damn I heard it ring, I think I heard it ring, yeahhh
If it's somethin that you think that's wrong got you feelin insecure
I'm grown - baby let me know, and then I'll let you know
Cause I'm the one that's footin the bills
And I'm not the wrong one, that's for real
You can get your shit and go, gooooo!
[Twista]
Now you don't see me all up in your dresser drawers
You don't see me goin through your Jag
You don't see me in your celli; you don't see me
searchin through your thongs, and you don't see me though your Gucci bag
Baby you got the shabazz; sometimes you need a swift, kick up the ass
just to to see how far a foot can go
Would you wash it and took it slow, couldn't though
Pressure cookin low, bitch I hope you find what you lookin fo'
I'm losin focus from fuckin witchu, don't get me charged
Come in from a show, my whole closet be picked apart
If anybody should be paranoid in this motherfucker it should be me
I'm the one smokin hydro by the jars
You need to leave my stuff alone, go and get some business of your own
cause me and you ain't spendin precious time together
Baby don't touch mine, I shouldn't need a ""don't touch"" sign
I ain't explainin nothin, you can find whatever
And all I gotta say is.
[Chorus w/ variations]
[Twista]
Now when I get up in your ooh-watcha-katcha
Move to the mm-ch-ka mm-ch-ka mm-ahh, don't lie
You peepin the details of my fax, mail and voice mail
and E-mail and why sugar, don't try
to come up with the justification for what you doin
The relationship's about to be ruined for what you persuin
Steadily tryna see who I'm screwin like I'm fuckin the nation
It's nothin but hatin that the homies be doin
Spittin rumors all up in your ear, tension in the atmosphere
Baby what's the mission here, listen here
You lookin for numbers and fist in hair
It must be here for a reason so quit before I have to make you disappear
I can do without you pokin through pockets
Prophecy's potent, whatchu peepin fo'?
I hate the way that all this time to tell what I been thinkin
shoulda told you when I thought about it a week ago
But now I'm tellin you.

R Kelly: You ain’t neva had a playa like me to take you shoppin
Take u to the crib and sex u nonstop and
Bone thugs top droppin
Vip with the bottles poppin
So clean we gotta take a picture
So sexy I wanna get wit u
Girl I’ll be singing thrilla
While u be squeezing pillows
And we can take a shower together
Get cozy in stormy weather
And if u ever going through something
I promise to make it betta
Ya just keep on lovin a thug
Massage and some sex when I tell u its time
U ain’t neva gotta want for nothing
As long as u down and u ready to ride
I wanna give u them butterflies
Have yo head all off up in da sky
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)

U ain’t neva got up with a thug nigga like this
Or got with a balla that spit to the rhythm like this
Or kick it with a platinum plus nigga like this
Well looka here now come look at how the player T drop the top
Rollin through flickin my music bumpin so the trunk wank
Kelly and Twista peep how we rock the block
Platinum Ferrari it nothing shorty
U its chump change
Or pull up in the 7-4 to the fend (4 to the fend)
Won’t u get in
While I’m steady blowin smoke in the wind (smoke in the wind)
Hoping to win
Now speakin words to my head in the bed
Then after we work then we can do it that one way
Lookin thick as a loaf of bread by legs
And u get at shakin the way the twista make the tongue play
And this is for tha love and the ladies
The fine women that be rollin Mercedes
Getting freaky and
And we be going (weo weo weo weo)

Whatcha gon' do when we come for you?
It's a stick up
Put yo hands up
Tell me whatcha gon' do when we come for you?
It's a stick up
Put yo hands up
[Hook]
We came for them, now they comin' for us
Whatcha gon' do when yo time is up?
We was unprepared for this lickin' plus
We been on the run from dawn to dust
Wrong nigga, wrong place, wrong car, wrong time
Guess I was greedy, shoulda kept the shine
But it ain't nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Fuck it, ain't givin' up nigga it's ride or die
[Buck] They got us on the run now, in a high-speed chase
Holdin' the Feds at gun point with no getaway place
[Benn] Nigga look quit bitchin', I ain't even ask for yo help
You keep talkin', I'ma burn both of y'all and get away myself
[Buck] Man them streets got roadblocks, there's choppers in the ghetto
Shinin' them lights on us, and them streets gettin' narrow
Nigga the path I chose got exposed by yo ass
Either get the ?? plenty ice and more cash
[Benn] Nigga shut the fuck up, I got another plan
[Buck] Here we go again
[Benn] Bust 2 warnin' shots to remind 'em, we still got it man
Tell 'em to lose the choppers, and if they don't we pop 'em
See all them cars behind 'em, shit I'm itchin' to stop 'em
My adrenaline's rushin', these bitches done ??
Robert Taylor raised me, nigga the hood got me scarred
[Buck] Damn Bennie, but this that real dilly
And we done showed our asses like Mr. Billy
Man here they come!!
[Hook]
[Benn] Man I ain't in no joint, I got 2 strikes plenty
I'm finna exit on 51st so we can get loose in a buildin'
[Buck] Man we got a quarter tank of gas and a briefcase full of cash
Back seat full of yay and the PIG's right off on our ass
[Benn] Nigga look the yay counterfeit, remember this a hit
They was supposed to escort dude but shit the bank we done hit
Man it's the only chance we got to bust shots at them hoes
Hand out the first meal so maybe the rest'll fold
[Buck] Nigga you watch too many movies
[Benn] Fuck that, it's our only chance
Grab the wheel muthafucka so I can aim at the van
[Buck] Man you stole a ride, sittin' on some shit that I ain't never seen
By you bein' too greedy, this shit still all a dream
[Benn] Man what the fuck, you givin' up nigga I don't need that
[Buck] But in how the fuck we supposed to get away with just two straps?
Now I could see if it wasn't no choppers nigga we might can escape
[Benn] Fuck it nigga here go the Nextel, negotiate
Tell 'em what we want
[Buck] Shoot!!
[Cop] Hey c'mon guys, I know you guys can do better than this
Now you need to slow it down
We gettin' the whole ? surrounded
Got the choppers and everything
What is it? I mean you guys can talk - c'mon let's negotiate
You guys are goin' down, I mean what is it you guys want?
[Buck] We need a helicopter at 552 . . .
[Benn] Gimme that!!
Man I'ma give you a list of 20 muthafuckaz at the MCC Buildin'
If they ain't released in 24 hours, yo boy outta here!!
[Hook]
[Benn] Now you see what the fuck I'm talkin' about, they offerin' us shit
They don't give a fuck about me, you, or this Fed bitch
Fuck negotiatin' with them niggaz, I'm finna off this nigga
[Buck] Now what the fuck we gon have as collateral if you pop this nigga?
Remember dude in the trunk, he don't really mean nothin'
Look at the gas tank, Oh no lie, Bennie I'm runnin'
[Benn] You ol' fool ass nigga, how far you think you gon' get?
Man that's the whole damn state
Do you know how much time we facin'?
Basically look at the situation, man I ain't got nothin' to lose
It damn 2001, my shorty need more shoes
[Buck] Probable cause, duckin' from laws, used to be fun
Now this'll cause us to probably to live a life on the run
[Benn] Man this negotiatin' shit ain't workin' fast, they need to hurry
We could probably get into the buildin' but I sho' ain't certain
[Buck] Yo was this really worth it?
[Benn] That's some shit you shoulda asked yourself
We in to deep and ain't nothin' but action left - c'mon
[Hook]
[Benn] Man what the fuck, man this muthafucka done ran outta gas man
Man shut the fuck up (Man please let me go man)
Man both of you muthafuckaz shut the fuck up
Now I'ma ? this muthafucka and you gon' escort him in the buildin'
And yo cover me man (I can't go in no buildin' man)
[Buck] What about dude in the trunk man?
[Benn] Man fuck dude in the trunk

And stand-off till they give us what the fuck we want

wen i saw a 745 gonna get inside is what i'm thinking
nothin but a wire in my jacket tryin to get up the courage to do it
all it takes is a few seconds to pursue it and get into it
move ahead with the mission hot while your the ignition
tryin to be quick with the procedure look around in my suspicion
get the guts cuz i make my mind feels like what i deserve
in the car on a empty street as i tell myself dont be scurred
?????? but i see through this mans eyes
im feelin as good as i ever felt up in this rich mans ride
so i just started up quickly madel it harder to come get me
even tho i done this before its like i took part of em with me
but he aint loosin no sleepin im steady cruisin n creepin
breakin no rules and no weaving as i get away smooth belly breathin
so as i get outta sight wen i take a plan for another ride
then split to the car to pick up speeders i drive whip through the night
just take me dancin tonight ive been all on my own
u promised one day we could thats what u sed on the phone
im jus a prisoner of love always hid from the light
take me dancin just take me dancin tonight
first i invision myself as twista rollin slick through the hood
saw me hurtin at first but now i sittin on leather and wood
started wavin at the shorties cuz i know im lookin cool
then i get visions bout the life of the man whos car was stole
wen i burn streets like fire as speed as high i like it
as i invision myself in his life like imma psychic
now i see things hes doing  wonderin if hes ? his ?
hes a company man whos out at night with 2 kids and a wife
theres complications within the marriage leavin her embarresed
like the trust aint no longer cherished wen the vows of love get damaged
like tellin her hes spendin his nights alone in his room
wen in the car u can smell the trace of another womens perfrume
just take me dancin tonight ive been all on my own
u promised one day we could thats what u sed on the phone
im jus a prisoner of love always hid from the light
take me dancin just take me dancin tonight
wen he got call up thought he was a balla
and a big shot calla as soon as he saw her
wen he got call up thought he was a balla

but wen he gets home will he be able to cover up all of his lies
as the voice of his lonely mistress by the ringing in my eyes

Yo Fiend, what up man? (Yo, yo)
You rollin' with these Legit Ballaz right? (Whomp)
Aight, well check it out
Won't you tell these muthafuckaz a lil' bit about where you come from
[Fiend]
Fire arms, sounds of alarms
Consistency in bodily harm
Where I'm from that's the norm
Fiend the ?
Lil' nigga ain't no man of creaton
Once we encounter the killin' spree we on
My defects have G's bet on
Niggaz dollars get they rep on
Speakin' with heat ? could bring death on
Nigga I'm called the killa
Cause every time he get it, it brought chills
Lead that's what made 'em take his ass for real
I done ? survivor
He never wrote the name of his drivers
And wondered that the man can deprive ya
It's there in black ink
With millions in dirty green had to think
Lives depreciated over drinks
Call me twisted
Rope burns to the neck was insisted
And all his hope turned to ""I guess should I risk it?""
[Fiend talkin]
And that's why the law is laid down
You know what I'm sayin'?
From Fiend to N.O. to Chi, Twista
Pimp run it now
[Hook - Fiend (Oobie)]
Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain
I said some survive the game
Some just get they names in the stories to be told
Why the young never make it old
Now to my hustlaz slangin' cain
I said some survive the game
Some just get they names in the stories to be told
Why the young never make it old (Why the young never make it old)
[Liffy Stokes]
I live my life drownin' in homicide
Never let the drama slide
We killaz quick to let it ride
Send a nigga beddy-by when I let it fly
Niggaz be yappin' but they scared to die
Talkin' plenty shit till I cap off with the .45
Look into these smoke red eyes, feel me starvin'
Feel me shakin' up that dope in my apartment
And picture me on top of the world and still servin'
Blessin' all my shorties with birds to keep 'em workin'
As long as my hood is tight, my mind is right
Look at the dope line tonight, just doin' aight
For the nugs
Y'all got paper, I got paper so let's find some ass to jug
This struggle for power keeps us all up to no good
With constant heat, we cruise the streets like cops on D's
With the itchy sittin' dead on the seat
For the wicked and weak, tryin' to get down on what we put down
For this grid-ound, that's why we stand firm with these rid-ounds
[Hook]
[Twista]
Never thought that the cries of my people would get louder
When Chief first came home with that glistenin' white powder
But it gave us power
Never thought them ? packs that had us buyin' clothes and pullin' hoes
Would have our new Starter jackets filled with bullet holes
(That's how it goes)
And who would have ever thought that when we would rock this shit
That we would end up gettin' our whole block lit
By-standers got hit up
And who would have ever thought that women would be up on silent nights
Lightin' pilot lights
I would be crept on my a mask on silent nights
Now I'm wonderin' and thinkin', how can a man make a sack ??
Flip a new Lac with his work
End up in the back of hearse
Then be packed in the dirt
? over turf, can you hear the Mack when it burst
He get cracked where it hurts
Feel the automatic when it jerks
Comin' up in the land where the white and blue Dracula's lurk
Is that what it's worth naw, niggaz got the chrome in ? in the whip
Never let the law get the low on the licks
Bet they got a mob and they mob full of tricks
You ain't on yo P's, you gotta be
Fuck a ? strategy, don't be punked like no lame
You just a Bone in the game
Steady baggin' work, hittin' licks, and stackin' cain'

Um, them wanna test the champion, it can't be done
You walking barb wires, watch me carve liars to shogun
Cuts a duck, fuck ""Naughty"" I'm in that hate ya ""Nature""
Ready to break ya, (state ya), claiming I raped ya, (faker)
Take you degrees deeper than death I get you dissed
To get you pissed, the mister split ya wrist
Thinking I bit twist now picture this
Me biting something from you, and you can't top me
Better yet stop me, or drop me, your technique is sloppy
Check my flow autopsy
Copy yet never be cleverly my shit blows up
Leaving them froze up, straight from the toes up
Rip these shows up, in my city, we run shit like president do
Turn you to residue, snatch you your revenue
Rip ""This and That"" like Dres'll a due
Vestibule, your dead bodies I feel we cut your hair short
Dissin the Chi, why dare sport
We fly more heads then airports
Thinking you hard but when I pull your card I bet ya stretch
Go fetch a Treach, I make him disappear like Etch A Sketch
Wretched nigga, keep Chi out your mouth or get your neck split
Quickly I used to wreck shit, but now punk I'm on some next shit
Check it, the crew you tried is making sure your bluer side
Face the beat down bitch nigga, fucking with Chi, suicide
[Chorus]
Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH
I wonder why (I wonder why motherfuckers wanna die) 4x
[Verse]
I come deep as golpher tactics, pop them like prophylactics
With flowmatics, no statics takin, breakin' punks up I'm a pro at it
Go at it with whoever, crew never cracks, pack gats
Fuck your chains and locks, chainsaws, hatchets, butter cutters and bats
Braids and blades and machetes, petty shit you carry
Can't scare me fairy, burn your obituary at the cemetary
II to a casket, heads in bread bask', was dead when lead blast
And burn him like ashes, FUCK A GHETTO BASTARD
Huh, come with that ""hey ho"", better stay low
end up with a halo, spread blood like mayo
Looks like a TKO, say no, to Treachery, bet ya be thinking you're ganking
I do the shankin', Naughty kids always get a spankin'
So uh, go diss some more emcees instead of these
Punk your better ease, or get your head filled up with holes like cheddar cheese
Never let a breeze, slow me down kid this ain't the season
""Tung Twist' back to Chicago""? Bitch, who told you I was leaving?
[Chorus]
Suidice when you're fucking with Chi - BOOYAH
I wonder why (I wonder why motherfuckers wanna die) 4x

Selector, my DJ cuts up, B-hyper, what's up
Let's beat the nuts up, eat the ducks up
Then sweep they guts up
The things I bring will make you spring forward and later fall back
Talking about Twisting don't impress you, like your shit is all that
Go get your tecs I got grenadas to pack pins
Be quick to stack men, black men with mac 10s
Ready to let their finger back bend
And if I catch your dreamin, of descendant schemin'
Y'all find an intoxicated demon, sucking semen, hear what I'm screamin?
Huh, another pussy wants to break me in a homosapian
Beat him down and wont give a fuck what type of shape he in
Yellow is the color of cape he in, punk your style'll be
Facing fatality, split his head like a personality
While I'll be cracking heads like jokes, leave a tight stitch

[Intro]
When I wake up in the mornin? love,
And the sunlight hurts my eyes,
Then somethin? with out warnin? love,
Bears heavy on my mind
[Twista]
Let's get them dollars, Let's get this money
[Verse 1 (Twista)]
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind,
I got my finger on tha trigga, stayin' on tha grind,
And when I wake up in the mornin', I got's to hit a lick,
Saw the 2000 and 3 Navi, on Sprees wit' a kit,
Soon as my eyes see tha sunshine,
My thoughts is jukin' the block, and dodgin' the one time,
Peep how we movin' the rocks and wit' pounds of dro before I double my shit,
I can serve sixteen ounces for six and get back ninety-six,
A killa for tha skrilla, Nigga, Best not be stalkin',
I got's to get them bigga, figga's, fuck what you talkin',
I represent them nigga's ballin' wit' jewelry full of zickels,
Down to the nigga's chasin' million, their dreams' servin' nickels,
And I know, one day, I'm gon' come up,
And when you see me, don't hate, that I rolled up,
Get paid whether you legit when you slang, or tippin' off 'cane,
Until I take a dip in the Range, I'm flippin' them thangs,
Gotta get that money man
[Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
It's Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day, lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day
[Verse 2 (Twista)]
A hustler's definition, is a hustler for scratch,
You serve a motherfucker, you serve him for that,
I'm makin' money off of verses when I spit 'em on tracks,
And if I ain't sellin' no records, I'm servin' them packs,
I got a, clip full of hollows, money makin's my motto,
Semi-auto and Marlboros in the bottle, 'til I hit the lotto,
Wit' dreams of ownin' a records label, flippin' words,
My nigga flippin' buildin's better than he was flippin' birds,
I got tha, mentality and tha motive I'm on a mission,
For tha money, you can get it too, it's all about yo ambition,
Play yo position, provide the plans, and follow procedures,
In tha six-hundred, blunted, wit' a pocket full of hundred's and Visa's,
Love, when I get that dust, hit 'em up, re-cock then I get back up,
Love, when I get that gig, get a crib, get a car when tha grip stack up,
It's still in the evenin' if I'm sleepin' paper problems,
Soon as I get up it's just another day, another dollar
Gotta get that money man
[Chorus (Anthony Hamilton)]
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day, lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day
[Verse 3 (Twista)]
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin' rollin' jags,
Got love for the thug nigga's who get' it on tha ave.,
Love for those, who can make a mil and sit back and laugh,
And love for the fine stripper's who get it poppin' ass,
Love for the single parent's that's workin' through the struggle,
Love for those who gotta make a livin' movin' muscle,
Love for those who gotta watch tha hater's rollin' bubbles,
Causin' trouble every time a young brotha try to hustle,
And if I can't, legally make or not
Then I gotta get, right back on the block
And if it no work we do a stick-up and whip-up a concoction,
Might leave yo face down in the dirt because hurtin's not an option
Gotta get that money man
[Chorus (Anthony Hamilton) x2]
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day, lovely day,
It's a lovely day, just got paid,
Stack it up, be on my way,
Lovely day, lovely day,
Lovely day
[Outro (Anthony Hamilton)]
When I wake up in the mornin' love,
And the sunlight hurts my eyes,
Somethin' without warnin' love,
Bears heavy on my mind

Damn girl, (damn)
You got a tattoo right there (right there, that's a tatty, tatty)
I like that (ooh shit, a tatty, tatty)
Sexy than a motherfucker
Can I kiss that
[Twista] (Chorus - 2x)
Is it on your chest (uh huh)
Is it on your back (uh huh)
Is it on your leg (uh huh)
Is it by your cat (uh huh)
Show me where your tatty, tatty, tatty

[Liffy Stokes]
Hey there shorty, what you working with
Let me see you pop that shit for daddy
That's shining blowing big pound out a pro caddy pick up
Diamonds flick up protect your tip tattoo bezel that lift up
Blinding them booshy hoes
I bends through the Gucci store
Grinning, Sprewells spinning, but I'm standing still
Man trying to call up this zig-zotic hot mama out by the Ville then
I'm talking top flight, high priced brown sugar
With the curly butter, thick hips and all
With the E-V-E kitty cat paws, tatted above her bra
When the Twist sat down by her draws
With a bust that needs dusting off
Cause a man keeps on running off
Just dropping her cheese, but shorty got me's
Taking trips to the tat shop, come on the black top
Let her feel Anita while we smoke B's
Cause you really gotta get greed
Fish that pearl, and then show it off to the world
Thickness shorty got niggaz out here screaming
Let me see your tattoo girl
[Chorus]
[Bennie Franks]
It's Mr. Fat, freaky, black, nasty, damn near 4 hundred grams
It's something bout a red bone tattoo, god damn
You need a cover up, etch out your baby daddy name
Girl I know you love to fuck, just the way you took the pain
Check my name and etiquete, oops I don't mean to be rude
I got a fetish for oops I mean I love some tattoos
Let's get up on a room, everythang's on me
Ain't got no A in the ointment but I got some Vaseline
The brandy
[High Beam]
I said she suck me like a riiiiiiib
And then she suck me like a neckbone
I've been gone slap then I took the Milly that home
Since nobody needed to drive
I'ma be the one they gone put it on (put it on me daddy)
What's that, what's that
Another tat with the Playboy bunny by her cootie cat
Got one going in the crack of her ass
But she can't really see cause her booty fat
Girl you don't know what I'd do to that
Got little mo' scrapes right up on the crack
Put Legit Ballin all across your back, take that off and let me see that
[Chorus]
[Twista]
Can I see up your freaky body especially with a ""Get It Wet"" tat-too
If you ever think a tat' ain't sexy on a chick well homie I got news
We can see the top part of their booties out, blouses up
Girl lick her tittie even with a lil gut
Pull a cap off there's a tatty on her back
with a tail pointin down to the cunt
Illustration slick girls, thick girls
with the thongs on not really the ones that excite me
Stick ya wood in ya shouldn't but the one on her bossom says bite me
When I see the yellow girls it be over
Cherry by her naval, on her back, on her shoulder
Check out the girls with the neon ink
The glow in the dark ink and I don't know which one is colder
Had a bitch put my name on her chest, my name on her neck
My name by her custom tat, and the custom interior
have my name in the Vet'They beat my tat', see I'm laced
Spit a lil game, hope they take the bait
But don't let your tat' dry up, come let me rub a perferation H
A big butt freak with a butterfly ring on each butt cheek to cover her behind
When she pull her Prada pants down
I pop that thing and it look like the butterfly be flying
Look I be lyin, I put it on the B's that I pearl
Twista travel all over the world
It's such a damn hotties, with the tatty up bodies
Let me see your tattoo girl
[Chorus]
[Lenny Hooks]
Swig the cris and light the hydro'
Spotted a chick across the dance flo'Pimps like them tilt the kangol
Out the club she shotguns 6-0-0
Straight to the Mo' she came out, her clothes
She tattooed up like her a hell's angel
I'm searching around like I'm 5-0
I'm bout to put something on it this ain't no tattoo hoe

Let me take you to the wicked wicked Westside
Where them niggaz carry chrome and the best die
Where we push up in the corners that we fight for
City from the shores breeds gangsters and Vice Lords
Bustin pistols while we runnin from the five-oh
Hit the adversaries up because we drive slow
Oh I'm a killa mayne, standin on these corners
Hustlin for my denim mayne, and if you try to move
Soon as I hear one shot
I'ma let the tec and desert eagle ride non-stop
If I have to I'll commit a murder just to maintain
Tell me what you thought I'm from a city where they gangbang
And I got that thang thang
Get it however you want it cop a fo' and then split
Hustle hard and work your way up 'til you holdin a brick
Cop an ounce of this 'dro I got the flyest shit in town
Bet you within a week you'll be able to get a pound
Go ahead and drop you can whip on 24's to get around
Gettin paper make me feel like... {la-da-da-dahhh-deeeee}
[Chorus:]
Let me see all of my gangsters come up - in Chi-Town
Let me see all of my hustlers come up - in Brooklyn
Let me see all of my riders come up - in the Bay
Let me see all of my killers come up - in Houston
Let me see all of my bitches come up - in A-T-L
Let me see all of my niggaz come up - M-I-A
[Twista:]
Now let me take you to the motherfuckin Southside
City of the chrome, get shot up for standin outside
Don't talk no shit or you can end up on primetime
My nigga Ty Nitti be holdin down the nine-nine
That's where the thugs lurks
I done been out there and seen them niggaz put in bloodwork
When I'm in the 100's you can always smell the scent of purple
These niggaz always gettin money in they inner circle
Fuck with 'em they fin' to hurt you; gotta get they cash on
Necessary evil they quick to put the mask on
Then they gotta put the mash on; steady bustin at each other
I take a tool and bust my strap and scream out ""Free my brother~!""
Bitch-ass motherfuckers; I'm about to break 'em out
If they hit me before they get me I'ma take 'em out
If we successful we gon' smoke a blunt and cruise home
Introduce him to his new Charger with no shoes on
'Til the haters move on
Fin' to set up shop now, gotsta hold the block down
Gettin paper make me feel like... {la-da-da-dahhh-deeeee}
[Chorus]
[Twista:]
Now let me take you to the motherfuckin projects
Where the true thugs, and the elite members of the mob at
Know somebody; better call them out or try to tell them later
When they tell you ""Where you from"" when they catch you on the elevator
The fiends lurkin, niggaz serve in pissy hallways
Can't say shit cause they be gettin money all day
Mercedes parked out front, chillin with a hat cocked to the left
In the ride with the glock cocked smokin a blunt
300Z with the Lamborghini do's and some hoes with a big ol' project booty
And the beat kinda hot but the cops wanna come
To hold the work he got that duty
So they can't do nothin to me
Seventh flo' with the 'dro now, nineteenth flo' by the rocks now
Gettin paper make me feel like... {la-da-da-dahhh-deeeee}
[Chorus]
[Twista:]
Yeah, some oh-six shit
For all the real niggaz and bitches to ride to
Not none of that ol' lame-ass, metaphoric-ass ol' goofy shit~!

[Twista]
Bounce that ass, load them cribs,

Rowdy motherfuckers that be scummy and'll go for the money,
ready to ride when they rollin' a lick
Thugs with the Chevy's, thugs with the trucks,
the real gun runner never run when he bust
Henny and he mobs in the front, smoke a 'dro blunt,
sippin' with a fifty sack under the nuts
Hoes with ass and no gut

Niggaz if it's static, then pass me the strap,
gonna RIDE 'Til MY RIDE
All the hoes that'll freak niggaz, with the 'fedi,
let's get buck up in the club
And all my soldiers, FALL OUT, gangstas, MOB UP
All the homies on the block, ante up on the fin,
and let's go get us a sack
Serve til we got a custom 'Llac, hustlin' packs
'til a nigga bust, then we bustin' back
Guys that'll roll them dice and win,
Girls with the 'fits that show the skin
Real niggaz mind your best friend at the pen,
Real hoes let your best friend know about men
Cause I be squeezin' ass
and'll make a full glass disappear like a genie
Move to the LOX and Beanie,
while them hoes backin' that thang up on my weenie
It's like no nigga in the world could see me
when I Ruff Ryde with Drag-On
Rollin' up big babies in a Mercedes,
if you want herb we got bombs
Chorus: Twista (Drag-On) (2x)
Gotta kick that shit for the fine bitches and all my nugz
For the ones who smoke pot, do stick ups, and ball in our hood
What do a nigga say when he sees Drag-On And Twista (kill me)
Gangsta (Let's ride), hustla (Feel me)
[Drag-On]
By know everybody should know, that the kid spit tight,
and this kid spit fire light
And the bitch I don' fucked like last night,
I don't give a fuck 'bout a 2 and a half mic
Cause the only motherfucfkin magazine that I read,
is when I buy my gun from it
How many bullets you could digest in that one stomach,
I suggest y'all run from it
And the click-click from the calico, I gotta go,
make it pimp with a lot of hoes
I'm the same motherfucker that's countin' that dough,
cookin' that coke to a pot of gold
Cause my rainbow, is every color top that crackhead cop
I don't care I gotta cap me a cop
As long as I got enough money to cop me a drop, pop enough glocks
Drag open up dope spots and co-op's in convo at condos
Keep the heat up in jeeps, in case y'all creep up on me
I run up on y'all in a cab with a meter on me
And the only on leavin' is me
And the only one bleedin' is you, tryin' to breeze with me
All I rock is E-N-Y-C-E, in the NYC with the white T
All I really do is R-U,
double F, R-Y-D-E, D-R-A-G, to the dash O-N
Catch me, smokin' potent, bet I leave y'all, niggaz soakin',
with your insides open

Hold the fuck up! (Slow down!)

Nigga, so, get ignorant!
Chorus: Twista (Drag-On)
[Twista]
Whether murder or bouncy beat, my flow be philosophical
Smokin' on tropical, achievin' all +Missions Impossible+
When I up the block at you, I'ma pop at you
If your momma cry there's nothin' I could do
Should not've fucked with Mr. Illogical
When I'm in to clubbin', huggin', shake it don't you break it
Your booty too sacred, can't take it, wanna see you naked
I done drunk a blue motherfucker, so you know I'm lit up
Everybody get up, sweat for the Twista, it's a stick up
[Drag-On]
This where the shit pick up, let me load this clip up,
just pour me some liquor
Flame-On and Twista,
let's see if you murdered who'll miss ya
I love the dirty south, that's why I gotta dirty mouth
that'll burn you out
Tell your bitch I got a dick that'll turn her out,
especially when I tell her turn around
I don' hurt her now
Shit'll come back, and I think it's time to get murdered now
I'm tired of silly clowns,
spittin' out weak shit, sound like me shit
You gon' make me pull a all nighter
Standin' infront of your crib with that gasoline and that lighter
That way we won't miss ya, Drag-On and Twista

Now thick, we roll on plenty chrome
50 strong when the temp is on, then I kick it on
Butter-bee how could you get it wrong
Girl yo homey don't know what she talkin' bout
Told you I came at her, now you wildin' and walkin' out
She tryin' to hate
You took the bait and you shoulda just been tickled
Cause you rollin' on 20-inch nickels
Neck and wrist full of sickles
Oobie, you wanna do me
Girl please, I'm who you need
Steady stackin' G's, I'm been givin' you too much cheese to leave
[Oobie]
Every time that I come around you
You're shovin' yo money all up in my face
And that's you're first mistake
The things that you bought for me were cool
But I still don't have to give in to you
You can't buy me

Boy you bout to get lonely
Pushin' up on my homey

You know you're outta place
You embarrass yourself from the things you do
But it's not the issue
I don't want you
Don't want you
And she told me what you said about me
But you didn't tell her you were handin' out G's
Straight takin' care of me
Takin' care of me

Now boy you're not here do what you wanna do to me
Just cause you paid off my bills for me
You're not gon' lie and cheat on me

Don't be runnin' that bullshit on me no more
All dried out with them lies baby
That's why you about to be lonely

I know a whole bunch of motherfuckers thats prepared whoop
Leave a body bloody red to scoop
Poppin off lead for loot
Shot the pussy up from head to boot
Just for talkin dramatic when it was static you was scared to shoot
Police prepared to swoop
To catch a nigga on the runway but don't none stay for the white chalk
If aired out your tip whatch your lip niggas pipes talk
I you wasn't seen then you might walk
Even if it ain't the time of day niggas will find a way like locos off of nodos
Cappin when you servin your blows niggas doze hoes
Got the popos posin as hobos
Take a photo of him please
Tell the Chi Town he freeze they don't give a fuck if it was DT's
They be up like the sea breeze on CC's
And they handin out these murders like free cheese
Could you pass me the B please
I got intercate shit to kick even though I campaign with a gang
Bumpin though in different denominations in the nations,
and the nations racin worried bacause I'm slangin the thangs
If you can ahng up at my town up a K Town
if you dissin them then you dissin me
Niggas actin like they glad to die so if you had to try,
if they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
just a unsolved mystery
[Chorus 2x]
Before I saw his body lyin down
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery
And left an unsolved mystery
Before I saw his body lyin down
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Call the popo the man and mess
Shot up his head and chess
Put to rest now the rest should be history
Before I saw his body lyin down
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Have you ever seen a bitch nigga give into mysery
And left an unsolved mystery
Before I saw his body lyin down
I heard a motherfucker crying now
Niggas actin like they glad to die
So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
[2nd vesre]
In a hoopty shorty's will design a spot
So when the get pulled over them people wouldn't find the spot
But if you ain't got it hid you have the flowest
if you can throw it and motherfucker its a nine to knot
Just go back to where your thang lay
Cause lo key niggas they started out in the gang way
But if you wild when your aim spray
Them niggas that you aired out is gonna be comin back the same day
In the middle of a war you ain't on the tip
if you get the guns and clips to keep doin what you doin
Is it the same chiefs that got the same beef
claimin they ain't been doin the bruh be givin it to 'em
Flamboyant niggas must be slow
If your bitch ain't get popped then its a blessin she a lucky hoe
Cause no matter where the fuck he go
In K Town they will dress him in a casket and tuxedo
Cause you can't be actin thug roof
Because of Hennesey and drug use these niggas love juice
Some don't even considered gettin caught
cause when you talk up some shit the gonna be quick and let the slugs loose
These motherfuckers heart is love boo
Especially like them niggas up at Ghostown Windy City snipe
Cause its a pitty when hype
For niggas wanna get witty
For comin too pretty
Get the chilli filled and desipher
To pay the piper and bow to viper
Twice is rough
Now is what I'm kickin hype enough
Cause everytime I puff and write this stuff
I kick a frenzy facin fuckin and fury cause I dont like to bluff
So if we ever get into it and let the static get to me
Lets squash it and make it history
Niggas actin like the glad to die
So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me
Just an unsolved mystery
[Chorus]
[3rd verse]
Now listen they be kickin hocus pocus
I done said shit to put your motherfucking eyes out of focus
So writing what I wrote is hopeless
If you see our base and you said then you better be ferosheous
And matter fact I hope the dopest
For to try to cope this is hopeless
Cause my lethal rhymes
Is the kind that can beat you blind
And pre-design
I pee through mine
Like I see through lines
Check the brain and see define
The reason I'm gunnin I tried the runnin
Cause I should have let you know
I don't give a fuck you was fronted because you was blunted
West side to the hunters you can't step to hoe
In the state of emergency urgenlty the ambulance will come
And then the law will come demand the gun
But bullshit irrelevence they need evidence
or trippin on elegance they be holdin out they hands for some
If anything they'll hand 'em some
Or get wit him here come the victum he be shot up in his pants and lungs
Cause he actin hard and ran his tongue
Don't mean another nigga he meet in the street gonna be the man to run
Cause a prison is some shit to see
Matter of fact fuck the talkin my lip let me hit the B

So if you had to try
If they faded you it wouldn't mean shit to me

Mothafuckaz talkin 'bout styles and shit
And who bit what and who made what
Nigga fuck all y'all styles
I'm finna set this shit off like this here
Chitowns murderous mob gothic
Hard knock it give me tha mothafuckin ammunition I'll cock it
Respected like i'm one of Gods prophets
Gotta put it down for legit ballaz and you don't think
That i'll rock it annihilate that nigga
'Cuz like a lamb I was sacrificed for this verbal murder religion
Imprisioned by my hunger to succeed
By the heart I be driven
No shakin, no shiverin, get your shit to bleed
Reciting street literature, shall i spit tha creed
Now who them mothafuckaz talkin 'bout bitin
Go get me the pump-out of my trunk-I'm finna buss
Y'all better run punk
Fuck where you got your style from I be the one
Rippin the track and I'm murderin
I'm in the middle of killin 'em off when the guns dump
With a young pump two to the brain don't even harm me
You fuckin every party, you wont even startle
You' the harder crew of lyrical giants
Turnin mothafuckaz like u to microscopic particles
To hype, to stop it the modules on cruise control
Ride out on these niggas-bitches-ho's
Ain't takin no titles I instantly bruise your soul
Talkin that shit to me- trigger vicious flows
Get to rippin my clothes and start snappin like I'm
Sniffin shit up the nose, and catchin convulsions
Till i'm trembling no surrendering start shootin and
Knockin mothafuckaz out like Benalyn
Reminiscin' on that adrenaline
Oh, now you rememberin
Overdose 'em on poisonous poetry from the west to the wild y'all
Gangbagin like Gotti, rockin tha party
Straight up shockin your body doin it Kami Kaze style y'all

Cause it's Victory or Death nigga, better stay out the way
When my adrenaline pumpin or you can get a..(click-clock-blast)
Die mothafucka die!
Ain't no makin me bleed cause i've got family to feed
It's [repeat]

I would rather die before i cant prosper I'm a mobsta
Won't stop ballin, because it's meant to be,
It's Victory or Death I gotta hustle till i'm gone
[repeat]
To all the folks and the lords.
The bloods and the crips and every ward lets roll
You gotta go- for what you know
If it's retaliation get low
When you get to the calico let it flow
Make these niggaz know in the door
Make a mothafucka bleed for what you need
Cuz the familys gotta eat in the last days it's hatred and greed
Luv to the Gov's, B.M.'s, Field marshals, elites and the chief
Soldiers we better take heed and realize
Signs of the times, stand by yo 9,
Watch out for tha haters and write yo' rhymes
But the industry is set up to fuck u so u better be on the grind
Don't be one of the blind gotta stay alert
And put in work cuz time is almost up
Twistas, Hurricanes, and Volcanoes erupt
So we can't stop the struggle,
I'm killin my enemy, breakin 'em off and not givin a fuck.
And I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
When i go to the sky
Thank you from savin me form a torturous life of hell,
But hile I'm here I'm straight legit ballin until I die
Lets better these years, feel the blood sweat and the tears
Organize, I'll sit back and smoke a Philly witcha
Never scared of my peers, I only got federal fears
And I'm known to put it down for my city nigga
And when we get full of this indo
Hydroponics and Chronic lock up ya doors and tha window
Better go and call up your kinfolks
Cause the riders that's down with this mob
Will murder when the wind blow
Don't know what you info
We bring terror in this Apocalyptic era of Armageddon we headin in
And the only way we can survive is if we come hard
And strive to be gods instead of men!

Can you be my daddy (daddy)
I need a daddy (daddy)
Won't you be my daddy (daddy)
Come and make it rain down on me
Come and make it rain down on me
Now come and kick it with the Twista
Black Caddy, Mack Daddy,
With a hoe up in the back seat
With the '97 pimp flow
Gotta feeling when you smocking
When I flip it to a track speed ?
Talking about a beautiful figure
Astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like a girl in uh..
What's that movie? nevermind
Let me enter your atmosphere
As you enter my world
And lemme touch that booty
I can't believe that your momma that cold
Her daughter got such an astonishing soul
You need a modeling role
Still a player know you got it
When you climbing from the bottom
To the top of that pole
Cause you can pop and control
Your fatty's so accurate
When I'm smacking it
It's making me say
""What I gotta do to get with that?""
When it come to making it rain,
I can get it wet
When it come to cuttin the monkey
I can get it wet
You gone see me to ya baby
You need a better man
Here come the politics,
I'm gonna be your weatherman
Cause everytime I'm lookin up
And I see more ass
I'm gonna constantly see
Rain in the forcast
This-a-way that-a-way
I'm flicking 5,000 ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
It's a celebration
You the champion
Here's the fetti confetti
Come on and get drunk
with the money hauler?
Chorus
You done been good,
But you can do better
I done been wet,
But I can get wetter
Come and make it rain down on me
But when I'm not for the feminine
And everybody that perceive with the hatred
I'm gonna teach them a lesson
I take shots of adrenaline
Cause that's the way I receive immunization
Against the recession
I got the muscle off my hustle and flow money
An entrepreneur with ways to get more money
So don't be trippin whenever you see me throw money
Hah. It's just a little bit of show money
But if you want me to get it wet another ways
Then I'm gonna have to beat it up the first time I play with you girl
Touch your ears and your neck and play with your pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play with you pearl?
When I lay you down you ain't gotta be fronting or faking
On me baby cause I know it takes the right touch
I ain't stoppin til you wet up the covers
Because I gotta keep on fucking til I see a lot of white stuff
Now you got me excited I can't hold it
I'm feeling it coming I'm bout to let off an explosion
Let it ride when I see you I'm animated and shaking
When I touch your body you catchin convulsions
That's when I know I'm doing what I'm supposed to
You chose me. I chose you.
Don't think I can get it wet? I told you
Come and let the Twist rain down on you

First time i met her i could tell she tastes like one of kind
If you dont think you tasty then baby go head save it
Coz Twista be messin with the flavas by Craig David
Tell em dawg

I met this fly girl in the club
Went by the name of pecan deluxe
This ice-cream was high maintenance
When i took her out,
Nearly cost me 20 bucks
Met this chick named walnut whip
Nearly made me sick til the point of throwin up
So i called chocolate chip
With the sweet toffee crisp
An i still cant get enough
[Bridge]
Your what i want
Your what i need
I wanna taste you (taste ya) take ya home with me
You look so good
Good enough to eat
I wonder if i could peel your wrapper
(i could be your fantasy)

Whats your flava

I take em in the middle of july
With tha drop top down in the park
When its summerin
These ice-creams lookin so fly
That i just cant lie
It all seems to bewilderin
They got these grown men
Runnin round...
Screamin out...
Actin worse than children...But i
Flow better...

Stack cheddah...
Get more tongue...

See you, you can crowl up
Girl i eat you awl up

Screamin licky licky while im leanin on some pimp shit
Went to a better spot, ran into a butter scotch

The one who make you frown up like the lemon in my ice tea
The muthafucka most likely
To get a tuba with the opposition in my position
I break em off when I give em tha heat
Steady re' for rollin
Bullets body decomposion

Check yo brakes and knee pads

The New Testament
These are the Street Scriptures for all my riders, niggaz, and hoes
Let me ask you a question:
Why give a bitch fame by sayin' his name?

Yeah, I'm talkin' to you nigga
You ain't no killa, on the riz-illa
So High Beam my nigga, get with 'em

AHHHHH!!

When I look that fool in his face and tell him he's a lie
Everybody want a cure but nobody wanna die
Put the cash in my face, I might take a try
Money motivated that nigga that threw up my sign
My wife's on my side with a .9 ready to ride
Hold my sixth sense up and ask buddy why
Shit get deep in the cold city of Chi
Could somebody, anybody tell me why-ay
Why-ya-y-yaah
Why-ya-y-yaah these boys they wanna try me-eeeee
Why-ya-y-yaah
Why-ya-y-yaah but these boys don't wanna die-eeeee

I'll sacrifice my word and my balls for this here
Straight down to earth with my real niggaz crack 'em beers
Straight up that mean mug muthafucka havin' no fear
What the fuck
You thought I was one of them bitch niggaz standin' right here
Legit Ballaz is the clique I break bread with
Niggaz I bust lead with
In the midst of confrontation, high-speed chasin'
Bend 'em, and bust 'em and stick 'em, I'm runnin' from the FED's shit
This is the New Testament, uh-huh we never dead bitch - NO

I'll make that damn fool get on his knees and say please
Bitches in the neighborhood spreadin' disease
Hatin' ass niggaz starin' and studyin' me
Cause I'm fresh up out the bank to get my daughter some cheese
But I got somethin' on my side like a lemon to squeeze
Lickin' bout a pack up at you muthafuckaz right at the knees
Probably givin' somethin' to fools cause the man in need
I been deep up in this game for a century
Now I'm makin' major moves and stackin' paper is my motto
Different day, different gear, hoppin' out a different auto
Put it on and I'll be jackin' off louchers like lotto
Showin' love to my niggaz who show me love in Chicago
It's fair but it's square, for the love of the game or they hate it
Many done died, plenty done tried from imitatin' it
Fuck what they say, keep faith in this world you'll make it
Thank him for everythang and every blessin' but don't fake it

[High Beam]
Trapped up in this wild life, thinkin' to myself
Askin' the Lord for forgiveness and thankin' him for my wealth
The block is on low when these slickers ain't plantin' drugs
Saturated with racial hatred result in a slug
That's why I stay high, gone off green
Fuckin' up muthafuckaz lyrically with the Beam
Got you and yo boys losin' yo breath like ??
Never disrespect a Legit Balla when on the scene
Ooh wee I rip shit like velcro
Get off in the studio
Fuck up the punk that step up got the umm next nigga screamin' ""Oh No""
Just when you thought that I was gon' fall I fuck around and ummm
Cock back explode, reload
Hit you with some shit that make you shake and shiver as I deliver
Shots from the 4-0
NO-NO!!
Got the next nigga screamin'

come and sit with me in V.I.P.
With those curves and cocoa skin
now where have you been
The tattoo on your belly's kinda hot
them about a shorty in the spot
You came in with a man
but I'm making plaaans
[chorus 1]
to be next to you
been checking out the rest and they just wont do
pretty young thing in a lexus coupe
been praying everyday to blessed with you (blessed with you)
but I am next to you
all I think about is undressing you
playing all alone just to touch with you
can we get it on in my bedroom
would ya mind
[chorus 2]
would ya mind
if I got to know ya better baby
your my type
and I really really want you lady so
make up your mind
do you want him or do you want me
take your time
its alright, I dont mind
I see ya checking out my rings and the platinum watch
your trying to figure out what I'm not
the keys to my range around my neck
and a legit royalty check
if ya looking for someone who has nice things
someone to give ya all the love you need
look no further I'm that man
and I got a plaaan
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
I wanna take ya home
get ya all alone
turn the lights down low
to a private show
kiss ya from head to toe
take off all your clothes
throw em on the floor
make a video
baby come stay awhile
you cant deny
what ya feel inside
its in your eyes
make up your mind
stop wasting time
baby its alright
would ya mind
[chorus 2 2x]
I wanna take ya home

make a video
baby come stay awhile
you cant deny
what ya feel inside
its in your eyes
make up your mind

* [Verse Two] -- from the DJ Clue CD ""The Professional""
[Verse One]
Yo, my squad is honored like Elijah Muhammad
But I'm God-retarded, ain't no righteousness in this heart of violence
Hard as diamond but I'm in the ruff, listen up
If you ever see me with the Feds you can bet it's in the cuffs
Ain't no snitch in us, bitch in us
Unofficial-ness, everything we outside you wish you was
Official thugs in the drug profession
Drug connections, drug addictions
Still seein the judge for drug possession
The four-D's, all these is more reas'
to either get big, or leave and let live
We the best there is T.S., ain't nobody else
We probably Dove, cause we all way on top of the shelf
I'm lockin your wealth with the master keys, freeze
Don't try to breeze, or I'ma squeeze and blast the back of your knees
Just pass the cheese, please don't test the toaster
My tech'll roast ya body faster than Ferrari's Testarossa
You're gettin closer to death, Reaper's got a hold on your breath
You goin straight to hell as you sell your soul for your flesh
You was posin a threat, now you froze in the bed
Minute ago, you was poppin shit, holdin ya dick
Now what's the problem, you ain't nuttin like you said on your album
I thought you was wildin bustin your guns and runnin the island
You was't violent, you was silent tryin to get college credits
How pathetic, did it to get out of the calisthetics
I'm +Dianetics+ combined with lyrics
My matureness is my insurance
Kill my appearance, I'm a shinin spirit
You gotta fear it, cause every last gem is poison
You gotta cheer it, you can't win you better join em
I'm head-annointin niggas like the Holy Gospel
I'm the only vato loco to smoke you with fire-blowin nostrils
Watch for the toast, when you see it, you better draw yours
Warlords, callin The Giant, it's all yours
[Verse Two]
Fuck all y'all non-believers; I roll with God, the Squad and T.S.
Out with the B.S. we platinum, they even doubted Jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brain-bolic with knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin it down, walkin around with gold by the pound
Frozen and drowned with diamond boulders all in the crown
Talk of the town, soakin you down wit toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and pound your corpse with a force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns, I'm on the serious tip
You keep playin.. and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk through the ghetto
Either spark your metal or get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit, I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mac in back of the Ac[ura]
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that, but don't think I won't counter act
My niggaz is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mac, quicker than Kung Fu
with the reflexes of a cat, and the speed of a mongoose

What the fuck, Terror Squad
All we do is battle what; what, what what
Yo it's ""The Dream Shatterer"" strictly for cream team battler
Ring rattlin microphone fiend spline splatterer
King of the throne, bringin it home five nights
Up in The Source - five mics
Whippin a Porsche - high price
Pumpin the 9-7, rhyme heaven her voice is mindbendin
Imaginin Angie nuttin but panties and my 911
That's what I'm reppin the thug tech and the glove
Step in the mud with less than a SCUD I'm splittin your rug
It's just I'm in love with Mrs. Martinez
Latin Goddess or Venus, you just happen to give me the hardest {penis}
You wanna see us apart, you're chasin the dark
Long as she run the battle she got a place in my heart
[Remy Martin]
Yo.. yo, yo, yo
All of a sudden the big question is, yo who this bitch Remy-nisce?
Is she really thorough with her borough, can she represent?
Do Remy write every line and every rhyme that she spit?
Is she, really the shit, is her flow really sick?
Get off my dick, keep your sorry ass compliments
I get mad quick y'all knowin me ain't got no sense
Bitch don't try to play me, because you not a player
Believe me, you don't really wanna see my gangster
It's easy to cock back and smack the shit out a hoe
Had to leave niggaz bleedin just so we could get our dough
It get me heated, that's why I wild out for no reason
on the Bruckner, like fuck you, gettin weeded and speedin
I'm untouchable nigga I ain't never have love for you niggaz
cause y'all pussy that's why I ain't never fuck with you niggaz
Motherfuckers is scandal, on the avenue of Randall
Don't slip into some shit you and your click can't really handle
I ain't havin it, get the cash out the cabinet
before I stab the bastard baby in the bassonet
I'll, body a botty bwoy, blow his gut open
Leave son chokin, gun still smokin
Know how many niggaz like, ""I bet you Pun wrote it""
Y'all can all take a dirty dildo and deep throat it!

Something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll.. roll..
[Big Pun]
You know I'm well known like Al Capone, fully blown like Ton' Montana
In a zone, sittin on chrome, stoned sippin on cham-pagna
Rollin ganja up in bible papers, see how high the lye can take us
Through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob
I make the kind of green a hustler dream
Bustin out the custard cream Viper
custom piped up with the mustard seams
Clustered green Fort Knox and hard (?) medallions
Mockin God even Italians see my batallion pull out the broad
I got the +Squad+ over-qualified, pullin over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted, three-wheelted hydraulic slide
Sparkin lye in the clouds and reppin my housin
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
[Chorus: Ashanti]
Ooohooo there's, something, I want to tell you
There's something I've been, thinking, that your, crew should know
Big Pun be the largest thang
Straight out of the projects
And that's how we roll.. roll..
[Big Pun]
I keep my Desert Eagle cocked back in my tuxedo with my top hat
What you broke motherfuckers know about that?
Lookin fat in Marc and Pelle leather like Fonzarelli
Sparkin Phillies with the Gods like Makaveli
On the celly (blown Benz, chrome rims)
Shinin like the (stone gems) on my (gold rings)
I got it sewn Twinz, I can't begin to tell you the story
that soared me from livin poorly to a modern day Cinderfella
I've been a killer and a drug dealer, a bugged nigga
But now I'm like Puffy cause money's thicker than blood player
I'm still a threat but now I think before I flip
Call my connects together
and figure which cleaner's the best for the hit
I get the job done, Pun's handlin business
Candlelight dinners, havin a toast with the most glamorous bitches
My road to riches was no Christmas
Now we blessed with gold Lazaruses
so expensive my whole family's religious
[Chorus]
[Big Pun]
Aiyyo I want it all you can call me greedy and superficial
long as my crew's official and pulls they pistols soon as I whistle
I'm tryin to triple a million and split it three ways
Joe the God, Full Eclipse, and myself - that'll be the day
I need a way to get it already got the ambition
Start the ignition, watch for the NARCs in the marked Expedition
I'm on a mission which requires a higher position
Desire and vision keeps the fire inside of me glistenin
I'm infinite like math, so I'm gonna last
But you wanna laugh all day, bullshit and sittin on your ass
I'm all about cash and the power
A stash with the power that lasts like hittin ass for an hour
Let's get it locked, I want a watch with baguetted rocks
so I can clock hoes with the glow that never stops
Forget the cops, we got Deserts and glocks too
Ready to rock whoever tryin to stop our cheddar from stockin forever
[Chorus]
[Ashanti]
Big Pun is the largest thang
Joey Crack be stayin paid
Terror Squad from the projects man.. {*fades*}

Yeah baby
There ain't nothing better
You know you like it like that
Check it out yo, yo
She had it goin on, red bone, fresh out of Bayamon
In the calle long, Dona Ana throwin at her corazon
I should of know she was a cachatera
Always watching novelas with her abuela
Gossiping that bonchinchera
Thought that she was better
Cause she was pure boricuan
I was New Yorican, the Bronx
Pledging my true allegiance
But now you're leaving me
See I lost out before
See you in my next life, adios mi amor
Mi amor
[Ricky]
She's into superstitions
Black cats and voodoo dolls
I feel a premonition
That girl's gonna make me fall
She'll make you take your clothes off
Going dancing in the rain
She'll make you live her crazy life
The girl will drive you right insane
2 -     [Ricky]
Upside, inside out
She's livin' la vida loca
She'll push and pull you down
Livin' la vida loca
Her lips are devil red
And her skin's the color of mocha
She will wear you out
Livin' la vida loca
[Ricky]
Woke up in New York City
In a funky, cheap hotel
She took my heart and she took my money
She must have slip me a sleeping pill
She never drinks the water
Makes you order French champagne
Once you've had a taste of her
You're guaranteed to go insane
Repeat 2 (2x)
[Cuban Link]
Yo, yo Joe the first day I saw her face
She had me walking in space
Wanting to say something
But I was frozen, stuck in one place
I ain't fronting Seis she was more amazing in grace
The type of face you pay to say everyday upon the stage
[Fat Joe]
I met her at a rave
Back in the days
We could of got engaged
Shorty's body was tight
Have many that ask her aids
Masquerades and mardi Gras
She likes to play menage et tois
Lost it all
But that's the way the hottie was
Repeat 2
Oh, she'll push and pull you down
Her lips are a devil's red
She will wear you out
(Livin' La Vida Loca)
Oh, oh yeah
Lips of devil's red
She will wear you out

Mamma.. I don't understand
Why he had to fuck with me, now I gotta kill this man
I said mamma.. now I'm on the run
Dear ma-mmahhhhhhh.. what have I done?
[Big Pun]
Somebody save me, I think I just killed somebody baby
Shoulda chilled but money was really tryin to play me
Couldn't hold it no more so I showed him the four
Duke was dissin my girl like she was hoein on tour
And knowin I'm raw, money tried to play fly
""I said whassup to the bitch; why she couldn't say hi?""
That ain't right!  I had to put him in his place
Remember them hollows I bought for three bottles?
I put 'em in his face
I didn't have to disgrace myself, hatin myself
""Ahora a tu!""  BLAM BLAM, brace yo'self
That's the law - the streets are like basketball
but sometimes you shoot, sometimes you pass it off
Can't always take a shot, make one mistake you upstate for what?
Too much hate, time to break the lock
I hate the cops so I ain't tryin to see 'em
I love a brother doin triple life but I ain't tryin to be him
That's why I be on the low, and keep my feet in the row
Cause they're tellin me as far as felonies
you get life for three in a row
Then whadday'know?  Last week at the flicks
I had to kill somebody, for steppin on my kicks (STUPID)
[Chorus]
[Big Pun]
I can murder half the world laugh while the other side hate me
but hurt one hair on my mamma head and I'ma, cry like a baby
She my heart and soul; what Jimi Hendrix was to rock'n'roll
Made me believe I could achieve the impossible
Now you know one of my weakness's, but Punisher keeps it glizz
So don't pull out cause when I pop oh what a relief it is
Send you where Jesus is - hold up, that's the gas chamber
Think before you put on that ski-mask and blast a stranger
Relax the anger, don't be so hard on yourself
That's how you'll end up twelve years old;
bein charged as an adult
Terror Squad is here to help so you can learn from our mistakes
Cause power just makes you reject destiny and devour your fate
How many hours I waste, tryin to figure the shit
Until I finally realized, we're just niggaz and spics
That's what they feel, what can I do but just stay real?
Keep somethin in the stash in case I gotta make bail
Cause ain't no brothers, runnin shit in the system
You goin straight to jail if you colored and fit the description
.. fuck you talkin about?  I live here
This is my buildin nigga; fuck you nigga!
That's my daughter right there playin.. fuck off me!
Get the fuck off!
[Chorus]
[Big Pun]
I don't have much time so I'm only gonna ask you once
to please forgive me mamma; I love you and I'm sorry I broke your heart
But I ask you to do me a favor and take care of my daughters
and raise them to be good respectable woman, like their mother
God bless her soul
And raise my son to be a good man, a better man than me
And for this I give you my soul, I love you

The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed

Don't stop, keep it movin, the streets'll ruin

Three kids and my motherfuckin big mamma
My sig sauer got different plans God knows I'm just a man
So hide your wrist if it's glistenin
Listen man, we just niggaz tryin to work it out
Listen friend, strictly biz it's nothin perso-nal
We thirsty now and I ain't drinkin out of plastic cups
Platinum plus (thorough) crystal glasses with the fancy cuts
Fancy us, livin life lavish
Drippin ice cabbage, livin in the six, with some white bad bitch
Tight package I gotta pass

With my fruit punch and my forty
Sweeter than candy, Brandy's the only one for me
You get it up
It's only the middle of the week
But when you called Joe and Pun
You kept it real with the streets
That's the true honor
Not the jewels or Garbana
Any fool can't accomplish just a few hundred dollars
That's paper thin, I got my mamma out the apron
I'm loyal to her from eight to ten
Make way for the twin

Who the twins that be making it hot
(Say what?)
Number one on you Billboard charts
Showing love to them thugs who be holding the blocks
And we be tearing up the club like the Three Six Mob

Perhaps maybe we can ball with this
And all get rich, I ain't only talking ish!

Some people say that I am not the same girl
They think that I am in my own world
What makes them think that I have changed, yeah

Yes everything is quite the same

Sitting on top the world
Sitting on top, no that's not so
Everybody changes, let it go

Back in the days...when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

I wonder why it's often said that my life's
A fairy tale and everything is so right
I wish that you could know the truth, yeah
My life is real so please don't get it twisted
Problems the same and got to be dealt with
These are the things I wish you knew, ooh yeah
Repeat 1

Ever since you wanted to be down
I wanted to put you on
But you ain't come around
Had no time for the don
Sixteen on the block
The latest phenomenon
Number one with a bullett
And your own sitcom
Brandy hand me one of the platinum hits
People talk but they don't know the half of it
Well the fact this is, we're in the worst business
And anything you have you deserve it miss
[Big Pun]
Encima del mundo
Follow the squad we never segundo
Tell el mundo, telling vatos of every remover
Word chula we packing men like Lollapalooza
From here to Havana, Cuba then Puerto Rico en scooter
Getting mula
Sitting on top of the world like A Buddha
Who the first Latin to go platinum without the basura

Never settle for second best cause I'm primera, which forever

I felt he found my letters, and read each one aloud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on
Strumming my pain with his fingers
Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly... with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly... with his song
WHaaaoooooo aoooooo whoaoaoao
lalalalalalaLALALALALALA ohohoh laaaaaa
LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Strumming my pain with his fingers
(yes he was) Singing my life with his words
Killing me softly with his song
Killing me softly... with his song
Telling my whole life with his words
Killing me softly... with his song
strummin my pain. yeyeyeyeye

Why's it feel so good?
When it hurts so bad, when it hurts so bad
Why's it feel so good?
I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right
But I, I loved the young man
And if you've ever been in love,
Then you'd understand
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it,
If you don't catch it,
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it,
If you just let it
See, I thought this feeling
It was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad?
Gave up my power,
I existed for you
But whoever knew the voodoo you'd do?
But I, I loved the young man
And if you've ever been in love you'd understand
What you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be

[Intro]
Yo, hip hop
Started out in the heart, uh huh
Yo, now everybody trying to chart
Say what?
Yo, hip hop
Started out in the heart
Yo, now everybody trying to chart
Come on now baby
Come on now baby
Come on now baby
Come on
Come on now baby
Come on now baby
Come on now baby
Come on
1 - Come on baby, light my fire
Everything you drop is so tired
Music is supposed to inspire
How come we ain't getting no higher?
Now tell me your philosophy
On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?
Now, who you know without any flaws
That lives above the spiritual laws
And does anything they feel just because
There's always someone there who'll applaud
Repeat 1
I know you think that you've got it all
And by making other people feel small
Makes you think you're unable to fall
But when you do, who you gonna call?
See, what you give is just what you get
I know it hasn't hit you yet
Now I don't mean to get you upset
But every cause has an effect, oh
Repeat 1
I cross sands in distant lands, make plans with the sheiks
Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak?
All I wanted was to sell like 500
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me and fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it- however do you want it?
Now you get it
Writing rhymes in the range with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented
And if your lines sound like mine, I'm taking a percentage
Unprecedented and still respected it when it vintage
I'm serious, I'm taking over areas in Aquarius
Running red lights with my 10,000 chariots
Just as Christ was a superstar, you stupid star
They'll hail you then they'll nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down
And make you face it, you slit the bag open
Put your pinkie in it, then taste it
Repeat 1 until fade

Trying to turn stone into bread
Masquerading like he got it figured out
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt
Left to his devices, those worth the sacrifices
Praying to the alter of himself
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
Cuz he knows they're not connected
And he shows them how to be just as he is
Virtually real, and commercially appealed
To the lust of all the people where he lives
Eve was so naive, blinded by the pride and greed
Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual
Caught up in emotion
Burning up in her devotion
To the king of exploitaion in the field
She handed him her virtue
Cuz he told her  I won't hurt you
So she lay with him to see how good it feels
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication
She brought affection home into her bed, quickly multiplying
Now the 3 of them are dieing by the poison she perceived to be good head
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment
Cuz everything appears to be the same
They entertain suggestion,
Next time just use protection
Desiring to cover up their shame
But much to their demise, poor decision closed their eyes
To the very antidote to their dilemma
Burning in their lust,
Both of them were dealt to us
Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky, in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion,
They can't even entertain the solution,
In a brain filled with vain information and pollution
Hiding from the truth,
He provided an excuse to explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done
Now if we can agree with who created us to be
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Then can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified
Un-learn everything you know, and let him teach you
Line upon line, every step upon pre-step, say goodbye,
To this decaying social system
He wants to know, how far we're willing to go
If we love him like we say we do,
He will try us
Just don't regress,
Or slip into hopelessness
Once he's satisfied his love,
He won't deny us,
And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now
And then he'll tell us,
What, what we gonna do now
Where we gonna go now, what we gonna say now

As I see his majesty's ebony eyes
His clear complexion got me open wide
I'm sayin', ""Come on, girl, roll with the ride""
Allow me to introduce to utilize
You need a vibe, I could tell through the eyes
If you decide you wanna roll with the real money
Live, keep it goin', flowin', you know that we go
It's all for the dough and the love for my people
N'I mean, come on we could blow this scene
We the types to make the nigga wanna drop his team
We could force the A/C and let me sack this cream
Cruisin' the Garden State as we conversate
About big time livin' so we both relate
Keepin' it real, honey, if you ain't the one, I can't tell

Well, could it be the dude he's caught, see as I swear
There's stares, especially smooth as Syndey Portier
Clean cut and dapper, seems he's straight and narrow
Tinglin' the bone marrow, team the almighty apparel
But I ain't that aggressive, instead I act suggestive
Bat my eye lashes right through the sunglasses
Sound perfectly with the classic under my dark glasses
I mouthin' all the words to Blue Magic (You must have put a spell on my

With all due respect till you 'pproached it
Hand off a the roach clip as I respectfully decline to smoke it
Roll get the ice, his demeanor was nice
He tried to freak it to my mental, word [Hey, yo', it was an accidental]
Yo', his talk was slick, my resume is kinda thick

I got a urge to ride the train and do some walkin' in the rain
It sounds the same, but meditate it for the brain
Plus I like to get to see if you as crazy as you claim
Dope blown, like iceberg, slim and down goin's
Uncut, it's all raw, dog, hit me off
Paid & Live, baby girl, I'm sayin' this connection
Be in through your burrow, territory in section, true
I come correct in all my agenda
Trump jewels, top gear, and Willie Wear linens
No question, I'll show you affection
As I proceed to lead your direction
Well, these procedures that you agree to
I'm gonna need to know a little bit more about yourself and family
Well, who's Paid and who's Live, where you live, what you drive
Never did a homicide let our molecules collide
And time will tell if you can endure with Nell
If you tryin' to knock it down then I'm not the type of girl
My mind's a pearl, and I done been around the world
But if you righteous, I might just let you spend the night and
Tuck me in real tight and watch the fight with Tyson
Kiss me on my cheek, I got the type of s@#$ to make a nigga fight for
weeks
Never mess with geeks
Well, mister Live I've decided that I like you
And if you try to get to know me better I won't fight you

The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins
You act like you ain't hear him then gave him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down then you called him again
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even fooling him
If you did it then, then you probably fuck again
Talking out your neck sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the gin
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hardrock when you're really a gem
Babygirl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending them
Now Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn.
It's silly when girls sell their soul because it's in
Look at where you be in hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again
Guys you know you better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend popping yang like you got yen
Let's not pretend, they wanna pack pistol by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face, men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of their three and four kids men
They facing a court case when the child's support late
Money taking, heart breaking now you wonder why women hate
men
The sneaky silent men the punk domestic violence men
The quick to shoot the semen stop acting like boys and be men
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
How you gon' win when you ain't right within
Come again
Come again, come again, come again, come again
Girls you know you better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before my record deal,
The streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem
Story starts at Hootaville grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
""Kill the guy"" in Carter park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been

Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back
A bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu
Main street roots tonic with the dreds
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lees to the tongue of my shoe
'Member Frelng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick were together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever

Looking back

You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got
Looking back
Thinking back, thinking back, thinking back
Drill teams on Munn street
Remember when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave.
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing your friends' names on your jeans with a marker
July 4th races off of Parker
Fireworks at Martin stadium
The Untouchable P.S.P., where all them crazy niggers be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self-Destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim
Sensations and '88 attracted kids from out-of-state
And everybody used to do the wop
Jack, Jack, Jack ya body
Nah, the Biz Mark used to amp up the party
I wish those days, they didn't stop
Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been
Make me recall my days in New Jerusalem
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got
Looking back
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
You know it's hot, don't forget what you've got

To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of his grace
For I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face
That the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Marching, marching, marching to Zion
Marching, marching
Marching, marching, marching to Zion
Beautiful, beautiful Zion
(repeat to end of song)

Well written topic
Broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce
Words so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat
Like I'm deuce
Two people both equal
Like I'm Gemini
Rather simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it
You can't stop it
Drop it
Your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles while I make international articles
And on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother business
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness
First handed I'm candid
You can't stand it
Respect demanded
And get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real
So I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
Now I be breakin' bread sippin Manichevitz wine
Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bend
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockerfeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela
Singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Maribella in Couture
Or collectin' residuals from off the Score
I'm makin' sure
I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle this is war
Word to Boonie
I makes a lot like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from
Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop
It's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks
you can't capsize this ship
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour
I'm about to change the focus
From the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus
To reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest
To the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall tryin to ball
While my team win the pennant
I'm about to be in it
For a minute
Then run for senate
Make a slum lord be the tenant
Give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it
Every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival
Documented in the bible
Like Moses and Aaron
Things gon change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna
Be seen through
Let God redeem you
Keep your deen true
Watch out what you cling to
You can get the green too
Observe how a queen do
And I remain calm readin' the 73 Psalm
Cause wit all this on I got the world in palm
You could get the money
You could get the power
But keep your eyes on the final hour

Although them again we will never, never, never trust
Dem noh know weh dem do, dig out yuh yei while dem sticking like glue,
Fling, skin, grin while dem plotting fah you,
True, Ah Who???
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you, to you
They say all the right things to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he's full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized like Menelik
And other African czars observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gonna idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they comin' gunnin'
I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers
Then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle
March through these streets like Soweto
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus, Jesus and Judas,
Backstabbers do this
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them, forgive them
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
Forgive them, forgive them
Gwan like dem love while dem rip yuh to shreds,
Trample pon yuh heart and lef yuh fi dead,
Dem a yuh fren who yuh depen pon from way back when,
But if yuh gi dem yuh back den yuh mus meet yuh end,
Dem noh know wey dem do,
Dem no know, dem no know, dem no know,
Dem no know, dem no know wey dem do

Everybody knows that they've guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
Time to get free, oh give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time
[First and only verse]
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world churches decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epedemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From here and like under water
Beyond the borders
Fond of sin and disorder
Bound by the strategy
It's systematic deprivaty
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em
Drunk of the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was fallin' in indescision
Apollin', callin' religion
Some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhD's in illusion
Masters of massconfusion
Bacholors in past illusion
Now who you choosin'
The head or the tail
The bloodshed of male
Or confidance in the veil
Conferences of Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me from all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as the Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than (?)
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We prolong the true enemies defeat
Death to the ascendancy
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the unescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly only water can purge the heart
From words, the fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
You're whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb, Saddam, and Minister Farakkhan
What's goin' on, what's the priority to you
What authority do we do
When the majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the lamb
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand
[Singing Chorus]
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, I'ma be who I am
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they've guilty, yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free, be who you're suppost to be
Freedom, said it's freedom time now
Freedom, said it's freedom time
Freedom, freedom time now

...I've written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation...
...It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I
put the record out, people would Misunderstand what I meant by  Rebel  and
they just take it to the streets...
[One and only verse]
Ok, yeah, alright...
I find it hard to say, that everything is alright
Don't look at me that way, like everything is alright
Cuz my own eyes can see, through all your false pretenses
But what you fail to see, is all the consequences
You think our lives are cheap, and easy to be wasted
As history repeats, so foul you can taste it
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
His life so incomplete, and nothing can replace it
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
Your lives so incomplete, and nothing can replace it
Fret not thyself I say, against these laws of man
Cuz like the Bible says, His blood is on their hands
And what I gotta say, and what I gotta say, is rebel
While today is still today, choose well
And what I gotta say, is rebel, it can't go down this way
Choose well, choose well, choose well...
...choose well, choose well, choose well
And while the people sleep, too comfortable to face it
Your lives are so incomplete, and nothing, and no one, can replace it
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel, rebel
Repent, the day is far too spent, rebel... rebel!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up...
Wake up and rebel
We must destroy in order to rebuild
Wake up, you might as well

Your stinkin' resolution
Is no type of solution
Preventin' me from freedom
Maintainin' your polution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord
That's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimised no more
I just don't sympathize no more

You just wanna use me
You say  love  then abuse me
You never thought you'd loose me
But how quickly we forget
That nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin'
Repressin' me to death

And your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box

I've just accepted what you said
Keepin' me among the dead
The only way to know
Is to walk then learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you've had everyone believed
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality
The system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice
To a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure...
Where is the passion in this living
Are you sure it's God you servin'
Obligated to a system
Getting less then you're deserving
Who made up these schools, I say
Who made up these rules, I say
Animal conditioning
Oh, just to keep us as a slave

Oh, just get out
Of this social (?)-----  PURGATORY
Just get out

Just get out
Superstition killing freedom
Knowin' my condition

And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

Content because that part of my life is finished

Moving down the streams of my lifetime
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat
Melting down the walls of inhibition
Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission
Dissolving my condition with his tears
[Chorus]
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
[Verse 2]
Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you
[Chorus]
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years
[Verse 3]
Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination? No no!
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land
[Chorus]
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
[Ad Libs Remainder]
Cleaning me
He's purging me
And moving me around
He's bathing me
And he's claiming me
And moving me around
Around and around and around
And around
Watching me, claiming me
Moving me around
He's purging me
He's been cleaning me
And moving me around
And around

I was lost but now I'm found-found-found
I just want you around

Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings underground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I have found

Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will

Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay

I felt he found my letters, and read each one aloud
I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on

Do their lives become a lie
Should they wither up and die
When they find out they deserve more than they know
And it's hard to be confused
When you find out you been used as a sacrifice for other peoples gain
And no matter what they say it's the same thing everyday
And no one seems concerned about your pain

Who make a little too much noise
When their dreams have flown way beyond the clouds
Would you rather see them silent
Or would you rather see them violent
Cause they never had a reason to be proud

Never underestimate those who you scar
'Cause karme, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long

Trying to pretend like your word is our bond

All their talk, it's seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation
An opportunity, to further situation
Why they're so important, is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional

The advice that we go, desperately searching for
The subconscious effort, to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional
Stuck in a system, that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage, by what everybody does
Counting all the money, that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance, in the name of love

It's the mystery of Inequity...
Said it's the misery of Inequity...
Said it's the history of Inequity...
When it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down
Children...
Eat your bread
Little children...
Eat your bread
Cuz it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down
[First and only verse]
Yo!
Ya'll can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors
Witness despised
Crooked lawyers
False Indictments publicized
Its entertainment...the arraignments
The subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon
Black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the surface on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that  In God We Trust
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator
Receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to they neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff
Representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution
Political prostitution
The more money you pay.. the further away solution
Legal actors
Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants
Morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers
Dodging duty for years
Hating the process
waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct?
Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt
Spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause
Prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind
Guilty never defined
Filthy as swine
A generation purin it's own mind
Legal extortion
Blown out of proportion
In vein deceit
The truth is obsolete
Only two positions:
Victimizer or Victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma trying to own a piece
of the  American Corona
The Revolving Door
Insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing
What are we working for?
Empty traditions
Reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Podition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief
Brethren can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men
Trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses
They run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them out really white
Internally they absent of light
trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse
Evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first
Angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth
Burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turning me ill
Let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real
Surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep
Troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap
Causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come
Find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh
Self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed
Hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die
Let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought...was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught
Where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie
Not realizing in Adam, all die

But it's a hopeless explanation to describe the situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect, cuz I'm morally defect
By reason of the god inside my head
Causing me to see, only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
Cuz I... can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be in sanity
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God thru my facade only material
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, a generations so aloof
Only followin' the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord, with all thine heart
And lean not to thine own understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall correct thy paths
Be not wise in thine on eyes,
Or you can't follow Him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cuz he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil, when we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, ey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Will reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me
Oh Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem providing you no protection.
Abide in Me and I in you, as the branch cannot bare
...fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the Vine, ye are the branches,
He that live in Me and I in him,
The same bring forth much fruit
For without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen Me
Do whatsoever, you asking My Name He may give to you
But in vain they call My Name
teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know knoweth the heart,
what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
...for why would you die
Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth(sp?)
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou may be saved from thy deception
How long, shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee
Oh Jerusalem, providing you no protection
Oh Jerusalem... (fade)

No matter how we remain in denial
Wasting time
Replacing time
With each empty excuse
But that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair
Knowing you're not there
Ashamed to just admit
I've been a fool
So I blame it on the sun
Run away from everyone
Hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery
Wrapped so miserably
In this deception that I'm wearin'  like a skin
Dying to maintain
Oh I keep trying to explain
A heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess
I have no choice but to confess
That I've been desperately trying to belong
Lying to myself
And everybody else
Refusing to admit my right was wrong

This treason from within
That reasons with my sin
Won't be happy till it sees the death of me
Selfishly addicted
To a life that I depicted
Conflicted cuz it's not reality
Oh what's left of me
I beg you desperately
Cause me to agree to what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself
I need you to save me from myself
Please save me from myself so I can heal
The choices that I have made
Oh have been nothing but mistakes
What a wasted use of space
Should I die before I wake?
In all of my religion
I've fortified this prison
Obligated to obey
The demands of bad decisions
Please save me from myself

Please save me from myself so I can heal

Messing with my mind
These social drugs
Telling me im fine
These social drugs
Messing with my head
These social drugs
They want me dead
Afraid to address
All the reality before me
Too proud to confess
That im addicted to a lie
So I seek temporary feelings
To replace reality
Though the truth is telling me I should die, no
BUT IVE BEEN TAUGHT TO LOVE IT
But they just don't confront it
I hate when I found out
That I can't do what I wanted
This emotional tantrum
Has become somewhat of an anthem playing FOR TIME TO TAKE A LITTLE TRIP
To hide this condemnation
I find a compilation
Of a manmande stimualtion
to deny my situation
Now unreality
is distorting what I see
Reporting back to me
A sense of false security
So in my imagination
Oh I must find a recreation
DESPERATELY SEARCHING WAYS
To alter my sensations
theres no equilibrium
inebriated till im numb
intoxicated till im dumb
to avoid confrontation
these social drugs
messing with my mind
these social drugs
telling me im blind
these social drugs
messing with my head
these social drugs
telling me im dead
now this chemical analogy
is our emotional reality
these political
traditional
and ethical stimulants
when the SOCIAL MEDICAID
wont let us be too upset
to the way things really are
Your taught to camouflauge regret
and those religious structures
tell us GOD want us to suffer
to suppot a situation
we all know is obligation
and if you shun an obligation
they'll just gun your repuation
like mob intimidation
to enforce participation
see they need to keep us fiends
to their lies and broken dreams
and if you find another means
Your told your being too extreme
and if you wanted to get clean
theres this pool of social streams
holding up their social GOLD
deifying noble things
now were all stuck in tradition
unable to state out position
to afraid to contradict
the expectations of the system
oh and the harsh reality
is they've made Grace for you and me
because
theyre just enslaving you and me!!!
these social drugs
messing with my mind

telling me im fine

They'll hail you then they'll nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down

And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be

In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me
And every word, every second, and every third
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (uh)
And when I play them, every chord is a poem
Telling the Lord how grateful I am cause I know him (what? word)

To keep him in my life
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right

Will turn out what you want to be

See, I thought this feeling
It was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad?
Gave up my power,
I existed for you
But whoever knew the voodoo you'd do?

[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
Yes, ladies and gentlemen
We have a special guest for you this evening
Ghost, you ready?
[Ghostface]
Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller
This about a young boy dealing with the older fellas
Promised him the lives you see on TV
He ran packs across town like rhyme CD's
And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks
Stacking too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box
Saving, he promised his mom a crib in Atlanta
And his pops got killed through debt, he was a dealer
So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases
No more cross-town, now he's crossing them states and
Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust
So when the door kicked open they scream ""This is a bust""
""Is it a set up?"", it seems funny, a scuffle broke out
He got hit, dropped the cases spitting blood out of his mouth
He walked four blocks to die trying to survive
And now all that's left is his mom screaming ""God Why?""
[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah, let me begin by saying ""Shut the fuck up!""
Let my begin by saying I don't think this man knew what he had in store
He opened the door and found the bag under the floor
Not a peep, always working a lot, get the flame, aim, pop
Open the box and take off out the back of the pawn shop
Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car
He felt like he been hustling so hard like a demon he pumped a cold heart
Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart, put the rings on his chain attached by both parts
He did the drop, one ring in a bag, envelope, all the money he had
Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale
Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail
In the box was a bullet made of gold
Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band
And he stared at it sitting in the palm of his hand
And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand
It was his wife in the picture on his side
With the ring on the finger on the week that she died
As he looked in the reflection, at those eyes so red
He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head like that
[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
Uh, yeah, uh
Fiasco!
[Lupe Fiasco]
You know he didn't have enough power in his thrusters to muster Warp 5
Plus if he pushed it, the fuel cells could rupture then they would die
Then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try
But he couldn't risk it, put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it
And told her goodbye, she started to cry, but he knew if he could distract 'em
He could buy her some time and she could make it out alive
Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off
Space mind had blew one of the hands off
Damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed
And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth
The final saga in the seven planet wars
Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward
His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass
He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like
[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
This has been a Fort Minor production
Ghostface! Fiasco!
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
It's an expression coming out of a simple can of paint
Look, it's the easiest way for the average kid to paint things using himself as the meaning of it
You gonna get into the gallery there soon, man
Why? I'm not gonna be famous one day
Why do you always say that?
Cause it's true

Yes the shit is raw, comin at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)
[Verse One: U-God]
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigga cuts
Acapella spittin shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hangin like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, hand held tote mm-hmm
[Break: (first two lines)]
[Verse Two: Ghostface Killah]
More than a thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, enhanced how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew, drew like an epic
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more games than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster
[Break]
[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
of the Wu and learned how to
fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-huggin mics with the grips of a python

[Verse Four: Cappadonna]
You heard of the rasp before but kept waitin
for the sun of song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propoganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nuttin yet
One man ran, tryin to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertainin motherfuckers can't stop O
in battlin, you don't want me to start tattlin
All upon the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattlin
Bitch, you ain't got nothin on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your think, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggaz still talkin that shit is absurd
My repotoire, is U.S.S.R.
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
and ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Cut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cuz you weak in the knees, like SWV
Tryin to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA ridin name printed in the tablet
under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound, and now we out like beers
and blunt power, born physically power speakin
The truth in the song be the pro-black teachin

Yo, kicked down the door on the spot, 260
2L, I heard they had O's for sale
I heard the same shit, money drive a burgundy whip
Keep it low, faded licenses plates and great plate
Where's the cat from, think he's from New Jerusalem
Pretty Rick did his thing for him, but he was usin him
Power sun, jungle, physical, you know the God
He go with Tim, the one who called Lover of God
Y. E.quality S.elf, I know the natural law now
It's time to get the God U and blow like mines
But on the Iow I heard he got BORN original sin
Back in a drive-through Kentucky Fried shot up his Ac
We got to get him Dunn, aliens is snatchin our bread
U.F.O.'s movin in with bigger plans than Fed, yo
Knock on Daddy-O's door get the scope
He's not home, he took Ishmael to Park Slope
There go the the dreads yo, swindle two bags of that stuff
That get you crashed out had you laid out like bums
Peace Keana, what's up with your girlfriend Wanda
She drive a green Honda, with legs like Jane Fonda
I just left her, she took Rashean to Pathmark then
jetted to Canal to get her man some Clarks
She said be back in ninety minutes, Ghostface God forbid
She say, peace to W, who's watchin the kids?
[Raekwon]
Two hours later, scheamin like DeNiro in Casino
Son better have more coke than Al Pacino
Keana ain't tellin no lies, last year she did a sting and a half
and Tymeek bought her a aircraft
But anyway, yo, Daddy-O home, we need the shotties nidow
When we get back, throw you a bit out
Later that night, stay mesmerized yo
Go get the green 5, meet you on the corner of Marriot
You ready, you got the E&J and the machete?
We goin upstairs, I hope one nigga is empty
We walked in, both of us, looked like terrorists
Masks on, second floor, Dunn yo, I handle this
Kick in the crib, the whole shit looked graphical
Natural, fuckin a white bitch, actual
fiends chanting, ""Do your thing Chef, handle it""
I shot him in the neck, it ricocheted and hit Carolyn
Ran to the back analyzin, much disguisin
Surprise we comin and their eyes were tranquilized
and buggin, throwin her twin cousins at his nugget, fuck it
Meet shottie waddy slug body hobby
Where the drugs, where the ounces you be bouncin
Fake cats announcin on the block, you loungin
Where the blow at, I ain't got shit, stop frontin
(Yo Chef, throw the joint in his mouth, money'll start stuntin
Bitch, show that bit, before I push your wig back
Chef stop wavin that, show him where the paper at)
Come here Valerie, you know the God he need a salary
Put down the pipe here's two tickets to a coke gallery
It's in the kitchen in the ceiling
(Baby girl kept squealin
Only found a white block of cheese from New Zealand
Ohhh shit! Yo, yo where that shit at yo?
Yo Chef, where that shit? What? What? Aiyyo...)

I remember in the elevators when we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us, (uh)
Staten's where the war is

Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them
[Genius/GZA]
We got a history, full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough it ain't no mystery
Long vision, from giants in every way
Rap czars, magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skill
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
They hit 'em fast, with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock
[Inspektah Deck]
We grindin', down to the bone
My name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with Chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome

Only dime dikes, with minds right, we choose Queens

Yeah we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, he ain't Ghost
It's no joke iron coat rife him with the stroke
One toke brains float, shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing
On the crime scene
Body on the block
Eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still had a lit cigarette between his fingertips
Danger when you step into the chamber with the master
Disaster, gotta blast ya, cuz I hafta

The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed off, cuz you worship the gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like, Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let iy rain curly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash (Dash..)

[Intro: Ghostface Killah, The Delphonics ]
(After the smoke is done) Yo
Yeah (Tang-o-Phonics) yeah, what, what, who wanna do it, what
(Number one)
Slap fire outcha monkey ass niggas
(After the smoke is done) word up, big dick, motherfucking house
Whaddup, bench press these cats
(Tang-o-Phonics number one) Yo
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo, god, show these niggas how we get deep, down, and dirty
Like Keyon, got his wig pushed back,
Five-thirty
Yo they gotta hit
Placed on my head, what should the god do?
Max out in Spain and do business with the Jews
Never that
Them never look angry out of synch
The imperial, industrial king got weight
Don't give a fuck
Like the poor part, we watch Heart To Heart
They used to push me in shuffel cards
Now I'm writing books like Ebinezzer
The porno teaser
Sayin words like sheeba
Educated rapper fouling the teaser
My team got rocks like Six Flags, plus the Wu lab
Cameras in nine bedrooms we own tags
Don't touch this
Cracklin hot shit
I snap ya shoulder blade in half,
Laugh, and pop shit
Reader's Digest, passed my book to L. Ron Hubbard
Got bagged that the world government tried to dub it
But devils love it
Movie trap raps cover the tracks
Like Ajax
Sharper than cuts laced on hardly scratched supreme clientel
My cartel
Willie Star passed,
Shit his piece, where's the Nobel?
Oh, well,
Siginin off as usual,
The arsonist, leavin niggas lost in the stairwell
[Break: Ghostface Killah, The Delphonics ()]
(Tang-o-Phonics number one) Yeah, yo, yo
Represent my projects Stapelton (after the smoke is done)
He represent that project Park Hill (tang-o-Phonics number one)
You represent that project Murder West Brighton Now Born
Arm bangin into that will (ahhhhh)
Word up, (after the smoke is clear) yeah, what, Stapelton
(Tang-o-phonics and Wu-Tang still here)
Park Hill, word up, yeah, yeah, New York
[Raekwon]
The greatest story ever told by me, precisely
Roman numeral I be
Plus three describe me
My son move like the toad
Get drunk
Speak in codes
Throw a fiend in the sleeper hold
Got beef with the cold
Met my comrad
Go half on this lamp down in Baghdad
Flippin like a mex tab
Get money like an A-rab
The type niggas snapped
Six legs on the crab
Now, hush, who wanna do what
My click better bust
[The RZA]
Underprivileged,
Grew up in a Stapelton house village,
Where blood flood the water in the streets like oil spilage
When the water was flowin (Tang-O-Phonics number one)
I spot a fifty-five borough
A nigga was still flowin,
Voice was echoin
I rise high like an Opera's
Procter wouldn't Gamble
The sample, it shocked her
My ninjas run wilder than Shaka Zulu
Some play peace like Donny the Guru
Others live to be wise and old like Desmond Dutchu
Undisputed champion
Bell holders
Shape and mold us
Sole controler of the moon
I, solar and polar
I blow half smoke through my nasal
Bust my ways with thirty words
Wu-Tang wasn't for children like
Cannibals raidin Sicilians
[Outro: The Delphonics]
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang-o-Phonics number one
After the smoke is done
Wu-Tang-o-Phonics number one
After the smoke is clear
Tang-o-Phonics and Wu-Tang still here
After the smoke is done

Hardy Boys shit...uh huh
Smoke a Winston to this shit nigga
Word up bout to fuckin' throw ya head up, Yea
Yo, yo he got his stones from Greece
In mouth he had like thirty plus karats
Big ratchets, smoke cigars like a Bogart classic
Told niggaz if he dies he want a glass casket
Parents died when he was five years old
Made his way inside the US with Columbian Gold
A fake name and a passport
Benetton luggage, one sister, pretty thing, light skin
Niggaz will body over her like fuck it
With a scar by her left eye
Her brother Alex was extremely close, he sold coats and minks
Had trays put in toilets and sinks
Loved to roller skate, ninety nine did time up in Rahway
Came home blown, the thorough kings and soldiers
Never gave a fuck about that MC beef in Queens
Alex, he was a rich nigga
He had close to ten bodies under his belt
His man did the last one and got murdered himself
Took him a while to get his head together
Alex one day out in LA, made a call in New York
Told his man Oc, God it's goin' down, fly the whole team in for support
Remember that Ray shit that Jamie Foxx played? That was my shit
I never got paid, they got rich off a stolen script
In ninety eight I seen Charles on the Cali strip
Showed him the copyrights, his life in the real flick
In Braille, he read it in no time
Hit me with his math, said I'll give you some more lines
Real talk, stand up dude
Said how you like Jamie Foxx to replay you? He said yea that's cool
But under one circumstance, you think he can bow my walk, flip my talk and my hands?
I said sure why not, he can imitate anything trust me this young boy hot
Shook his hand then I bounced in the limo
Grabbed my cell, bit my cigar and then rolled down the window
Contacted Stony Brook and Roberts
Told them we got it in ten ?, yo Ray Ray signed it
Now we can move on and shoot this live shit
With mad options, Paramount and DreamWorks we shop it
Or Mandalay and New Line cop it
I go and get ten mil' and blow it on the independent market
But anyway down in PF Chains, I had a meeting with this rich investor
Said they'll throw twenty million on the kid's film only if he chose the cast
He was drunk, he was talkin' real fast
So I test his mouth, laid back then I put him on blast
Where exactly we gon' get this cash?
I gotta ill Gotti Gigante connect
Wise guys that kill Bulotti, catching bodies, earnin' respect
The waiter came in a dropped off the shrimp fried rice he ordered
I said thanks as he poured my water
Then out came the veggie rolls, sesame chicken and mint tea
Rice wine had me wanting to pee
Said excuse me I'll be right back, pardon me
Grabbed his glass and he nodded to me
Skated off to take a piss, the shit felt like a nut
Got back the dude vanished, briefcase, script, and all
Ask the waiter where he go, the motherfucker spoke Spanish

Intro One: [some movie]
What dey gives you blood?
Three months man
Whatchu doin in here anyway?  You oughta be home with your momma
How old are you boy?
Thirteen
Thirteen?  Damn, the bastards must be runnin outta niggaz to arrest
Intro: Ghostface
Yeah, ohh yeah, this goes out
to all the families that went through the struggle
Yeah, from the heart
It was from the heart, everything was real
[Mary J.]
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
Verse One:
Yo, dwellin in the past, flashbacks when I was young
Whoever thought that I'd have a baby girl and three sons
I'm goin through this difficult stage I find it hard to believe
Why my old Earth had so many seeds
But she's an old woman, and due to me I respect that
I saw life for what it's really worth and took a step back
Family ain't family no more, we used to play ball
Eggs after school, eat grits cause we was poor
Grab the pliers for the channel, fix the hanger on the TV
Rockin each others pants to school wasn't easy
We survived winters, snotty nosed with no coats
We kept it real, but the older brother still had jokes
Sadly, daddy left me at the age of six
I didn't know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
She cried, and grandma held the family down
I guess mommy wasn't strong enough, she just went down
Check it, fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
Roaches everywhere, cousins and aunts was there
Four in the bed, two at the foot, two at the head
I didn't like to sleep with Jon-Jon he peed the bed
Seven o'clock, pluckin roaches out the cereal box
Some shared the same spoon, watchin saturday cartoons
Sugar water was our thing, every meal was no thrill
In the summer, free lunch held us down like steel
And there was days I had to go to Tex house with a note
Stating ""Gloria can I borrow some food I'm dead broke""
So embarrasin I couldn't stand to knock on they door
My friends might be laughin, I spent stamps in stores
Mommy where's the toilet paper, use the newspaper
Look Ms. Rose gave us a couch, she's the neighbor
Things was deep, my whole youth was sharper than cleats
Two brothers with muscular dystrophy, it killed me
But I remember this, mom's would lick her finger tips
To wipe the cold out my eye before school wit her spit
Case worker had her runnin back to face to face
I caught a case, housin tried to throw us out of our place
Sometimes I look up at the stars and analyze the sky
And ask myself was I meant to be here... why?
Yeah, yo
Chorus: Mary J. Blige
All that I got is you
And I'm so thankful I made it through
(repeat 4X)
Word up mommy, I love you
Word up
It was all you, word, you brought me in like this
Verse Two: Mary J. Blige, Poppa Wu
I sit and think about
All the times we did without, yeah
I always said I woudn't cry
When I saw tears in your eyes
I understand that daddy's not here now
But some way or somehow, I will always be around, yeah
All things that I did from this to them
Oh from drugs to being there
Being down and out and I love you always
Yeah, you say
You see the universe, which consists of the sun moon and star
And them planets, that exist in my space
Like man woman and child
You understand?
We got to keep it real, and what reality and reality will keep it real with us
I remember them good ol days
Because see, that's the child I was
What made me the man I am today
See cause if you forget where you come from, heheh
You're never gonna make it where you're goin, aheh
Because you lost the reality of yourself
So take one stroll through your mind
And see what you will find
And you'll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again
Heheheh, yeah heheheheh ahaheheheh

Yo, check these up top murderous
Snowy in the bezzle as the cloud merges

Kid who punked out bust a shot uip in the becon
Catch me in the corner not speakin
Crushed out heavenly, U.G. rock the sweet daddy long fox minks
Chicken and brocolli, Wally's look stinky
With his man straight from Raleigh Durham, he recognized Kojak
I slapped him five, Masta Killa cracked his tiny form
E'rybody break bread, huddle around
Guzzle that, I'm about to throw a hand in your bag
Since the face been revealed, game got real
Radio been gassin niggaz, my imposters scream they ill
I'm the inventor, '86 rhymin at the center
Debut '93 LP told you to Enter
Punk faggot niggaz stealin my light
Crawl up in the bed with grandma,
beneath the La-Z-Boy where ya hid ya knife
Ghost is back, stretch Cadillacs, fruit cocktails
Hit the shells at Paul's Pastry Rack
Walk with me like Darthy tried to judge these
plush degrees, said the cow, wrap the fees
Gettin waxed all through the drive-thru
Take the stand, throw my hand all on the Bible
and tell lies too, I'm the ultimate
splash the Wolverine Razor Sharp ring, dolomite

Aiyyo, this rappin's like Ziti, facin me real TV
Crash at high-speeds, strawberry, kiwi
As we approach, yo herb, the Gods bail
These Staten Island ferryboat cats bail
Fresh cellies, 50 thief up in the city
We banned for life, Apollo kids live to spit the real
[Ghostface]
A pair of bright phat yellow Air Max
Hit the racks, stack 'em up Son, $20 off no tax
Street merchant tucked in the cloud, stay splurgin
Rock a eagle head, 6-inch height was the bird
Monday night Dallas verse Jets, dudes slid in with one hand
Two culture-ciphers, one bag of wet
Heavy rain fucked my kicks up
Wasn't lookin, splashed in the puddle
Bitch laughin, first thought was beat the bitch up
Mossied off gracefully, New York's most wanted tee-ball hawk
Seen the yellow brick road, lust of pastries
Same Ghostface, holy in the mind
Last scene: Manhatten Chase
We drew the six-eight digit in the briefcase
Rawness, title is Hell-bound
Quick to reload around faces, surround look astound
[Raekwon]
We split a fair one, poker nose money
Gin rummy with glare, spot the lame, bit his ear
Yo, you taste a tea-spoon, 300 goons, stash baloons
Locked in lab rooms, hit with glock, stashed in Grant's Tomb
Clocked him like a patient, his stock's full, hustle invasion
Knowin now, we cocked a block off, the chain tri-color
Freezin in valor, ice-sicle galore
Gas station light gleamin on the wall
Cop WiseGuy jams, James Bond vans
Niggaz flipped Timbs, rock boats under water, watch clams
pose at the stand-off, mad timid
hopin that the gun fall, guess him like lottery balls, yo

Invite the fight, we all die tonight
The life I lived, a 25 to life bid
Parole reneged, I stroll the globe fugitive
CREAM is short, C-cypher power stalk plus the fiend talk
Three G's accost in Supreme Court
White lies and blackmail land me back in jail
We're all for sale, a stolen gold but it fail
Stranded on the front line, I shine to the dumb and blind
It comes time I take back what was once mine
Crunch time in the first quarter, from the worst slaughter
Devil's poisonin the birth water
The earth daughter rest her head on my chest
Through the struggle we cuddle under half-moon crest
While the press plant fear and exploit the gun blastin
Central broadcasting is shackling, nerves are unfastened, shhhh
Trapped in deep-water gaspin
I Clash With the Titans from my half on the action
[Verse Two: RZA]
I stop producers careers, the weak spot was their ears
Scorpion darts hits their mark, pierce their heart with silver spears
You're bewildered, my unsaturated, low filtered
Devils still peeled it still they're living built tilted
MC's upon their axis, their body has a tactic
Lactic acid, desert drop cactus, practice
You can never master, it's invincible, Wu-Tang indispensable
One nation under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice, the mic is in my clutches
Thugs who bring ruckus, leave in crutches
Unforgiveable snakes face the double-edged swords starts to swivel
Decapitates the head, makes the projects, more livable
Interchangable, caution flameable
My chamber is ninety-nine plus one unnameable, angles
And strangles, microphone cords start to dangle
Silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
Retrieve through your doors
Seep out like sweat through the pores
Destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare
[Verse Three: Raekwon the Chef]
(Assassination day)
First of all, before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon
Don, spread it out like Grey Poupon
Splurgin, mergin in the suburbs, using this just like an adverb
Action word, flowing like a blackbird
God came in, aimin like Terry Bradshaw
He hit the crash bar, stay relaxed God, his shit is smashed Pah
You handle this just like algebra, UFO spot 'em like Galaga
Hold on like bullet-proof Acuras
You so fly, yeah right, you want to get me high
Yo Bobby, you hear how I'm shootin it like they blew top snow
You won't play me like your lady
Pay me three-eighty spit it at you like a baby
Final destination Haiti
[Verse Four: Masta Killa]
War is extremely serious and it saddens me
To have to take tings to deadly measures
And have you measured and shot for no pay
It's assassination day I stalk my enemy like prey
Tranked by deceptional sounds that deceives
And lures MC's to the lair
With a mic-like bait, then awaits to be bitten by greed
Temptation tempts my victim to proceed
Forward, ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
You'd rather pursue DEATH than admit defeat
Now who's best to describe for what I specialize in
Murdereous rhymin, constantly in climbin
My mind spits with an enormous kickback
Your brain didn't absorb the impact
Disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback...
It's assassination day, I
It's assassination day
It's assassination day
It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy
It's assassination day, I stalk my enemy

If it's a boy
His swag and ditty bop'll be just like mine
And if it's a girl
Ooh, just like her momma she gon' be so fly
What a joy we made, from the love we made
Yeah... yeah...
Yo, aiyo, I ran up on the corner, poppa warned her 'what'
She pulled her shirt down, smiled, trying to hide her butt
I said 'Nah, baby girlfriend, you ain't gotta do that'
Hope you ain't the anorexic type, trying to lose that
Us boys like 'em thick, short weaves, curls, braids
I take 'em buck 50, 60 with them thick legs
We can sail it out, five nights, six days
Boat cruise, wardrobe flights, everything's paid
If I'm aggressive, just pardon my gangsta
I just wanna get to know you, get to show you
The way I move, that's part of my gangsta
Like art, yo, I can sit you down and paint cha
Plus my stove game's up, no red meat, but having you
In my cypher right now, makes me feel complete
Like a baby going night-night, sucking on his baby bottle
You in a class by yourself, all them chicks follow
Chorus
Yeah, yo, she cook and clean, matter fact she saved my life
When I'm outdoor, she check and see if I'm alright
I'm OK, babe, how you? I'm alright
Just that the baby's kicking, I want some Popeye chicken
And my back kinda hurt from the way I was sitting
Hurry home so you can rub my big belly and kiss it
And I need some, don't be fresh, girl
You know I can't help it, baby, it stay wet, girl
Yeah, that's my joy, love, strawberry shortcake
Leave me weak in the knees where I can't even walk straight
That's the reason I got two court dates
Grown nigga like me let his thing blaze for that
I was raised in the Stat', that's my word
I pluck something if you fuck with my bat
And my name ring round the way, girl, she the sweetest thing
I love you Starks, writing hearts in between our names
Chorus
Mr. Producer, drop the beat right here, now
Ghostface Killah, let me talk to them
Radio Raheem
I will be the sweetest thing you've ever known
Like a kiss on a, collarbone
I wanna be ya, best friend, your homey and your king
And bring to fruition, all of your dreams
And so you're having my baby
So stay forever my lady, like Jodeci
Now, push (push) harder (harder)
I'd rather you be wifey, than to be a baby father

Chorus
Tell your crew to be easy, niggaz run around
With them fake frowns, sell 'em on eBay
Get word to the DJ, tell 'em Staten Island's
In the house, put the record on replay
Colorful kicks and my closet like Baskin-Robbins
Central Park killings, stab niggas while they jogging
No shirt on, whilin' like I sniffed the eight
At the ball game, jumped down and stole the base
Some muthafuckas said it was bass
Silly me, thought it was a 12 by 12 inch Colombian snowflake
Mob Jacob slow cut 8 six, the semi have
Niggas running like Forrest when he broke his braces, pa
Scold a nigga like a pile of hot chocolate
Before I eat her, I belong on a bitch cartridge
Niggas kill me potraying that hard shit
Shove his face in the dirt like an ostrich
On some mob shit, no talking, like we resolve shit
Stretch a nigga out like an enlarged dick
That's one for you, one-two for me
I'm hoggin' and shit, y'all muthafuckas best to be easy
The pyroclastic flow, you know the side, bitch
You know the side, bitch, huh, ah
Fuck you, if you don't think I get money
I get it all day, standing in the hallway
On broadway, bitches wanna call Shea
Over to the car, but hoe, I'm the superstar
Get your ass out, fuck if you pass out
Walk over to ya man, pull the cash out
Put it in my hand, watch a nigga mash out
Walk back to your car, with your ass out
Fuck a ghostwriter, nigga down wit Ghostface
I'm a killa, wit that chrome in ya face
Blow ya face back, turn you into a ghost
Hit you like Kenny hit Casper on the post
West coast, ya hoe, ya gotta love it
It's Ice Cube, yea, bitch, I got it covered
I got a movie for ya kids, a dick for your bitch
A four-five slug for your wig
They wanna put me out the league like Terrell
Til they CD smokin' double barrels
Ice Cube, will fuck off movie money
Then serve you on the mic, and make whitey feel funny
Yeah... what's happpening New York City?

Live from Staten Island, where the gangstas kill
Only place on the map, that got the 30 dollar bill
And we front like we got millions
Our specialty is how we willie, niggas
That's how Buck brought the building
And the police is pussy, they protect and serve
They connect, with baseheads then they frisk our birds
Smack DVDs, blowin' herb, I'm in the room
Bonin' these two white bitches, Ice baggin' up work
That's how we get down, fuck Vegas
The black Carlo Gambino, rockin' the wallo's
Blow his diamonds in Z-No's, spicey, verses is jalapeno
Best to leave, when I'm in the big Escalade, I'm sittin' on Dino
Tone Stark, a poet's art, kiss the girls
And bake them pies, clean up, some are old darts
This that real live don' shit, you heard!
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, they lick forty rounds, today
Okay, plus the shit is mad hot around the way
Niggas don't give a fuck on any time or day
Or if he dyin' today, or could he find a way
Blow niggas over 'turt, bitches, dimes and trays
Blow a nigga a jewel and watch him slide away
It's like that, in the hood, he in the grimy say
But what we try'nna say is gonna ""be this way""
It don't have to... it don't have to... ""My God!""
[Ghostface Killah]
With big carrots and static, with that leaves the bad habits
Drugs layin' in buildings with great big automatics
Anonimos' in the hood, it's a fact, we could do magic
Splatter faggots in lobbies, the heat burn off his eyelashes
Don't try to pass this, back up or you'll receive something
Real tragic, them hollows'll race through your jacket
Semi gangstas with weak tactics
Forensic scientists called in to display graphics
For square inch to his back winds
They brain is spleen, it's left all over a fiend's mattress
Bastard, we cock and squeeze after we leave our ratchets
We keep the hood cryin' for massive havoc
No Trix we take from silly rabbits, yo feed them lead carrots
The little mans'll connect and they touch that fabric
The only thing that can stop 'em is that tephlon phat shit
Maybe artillery's heavy like a bunch of fat chicks
Brrrr.... baow! Ain't no comin' back bitch!

We left the jewelry store, feelin' like we left the morgue
We was frozen, and I brought an iced out Trojan
That's for pussies whose golden, who got Toney wide open
I put my ring up to my man's waves and seen an ocean
Move like a wolf, kid, in sheep's clothing
Snatch the money bag off the milk truck and kept boating
I be potent like ibuprofen, I be coastin'
With two shotties on me, in your grimiest lobby smokin'

Spelled honey when she blew it out it turned to water word

She put the perfume to her neck and sprayed it

It make a young girl steez yo feel outdated
And know the married chicks shopping with they man's hated
One stone on her finger was green, Maybeline
Cover Girl lipstick, plump color fingertips
Revlon face blush, oh-five-six shit
The ashes was hangin off her stog' so she flicked it
Damn, had to bundle up, I call goosebumps

So it seems like it doesn't make sense...
[Female singing with laughing in the background]
[sniffing]
Yea, it was them cute pretty bitches that was smelling like coke
They kept going [egh egh] like they had shit in they throats
They had stacks on the tables, cables
I had to say it was like early May a few days 'til my birthday date, baby date
I'll play to the sucker DJ, lookin' like Enrique
Told him to throw in that Supreme Cliee-ente
He said just gave a nod with a thumbs up wink
I just put down my dollar bill, took off my mink
Bartenders know me big spenders, gave us those monster drinks
Sent us ? and cigars that stink
Playing them oldie but goodie classics, them honies had fat asses
Noses runnin' from the raw, they hid behind they glasses
Toney with the Montana, I came to play
With my long fingernail, yo honey you should pass that yay
Let me see what color you got boo, I got that beige
I see y'all from the perihperals? ladies far right from the stage
I'm thirty-three, I look twenty-six with big furs on
What y'all inherent the Santa Maria? Y'all money that long?
Your father must have fell back when y'all started fucking
You asked me what I think about dude? I say fuck him
And this one bitch called me Fat Albert
The way my pockets had the mumps you know that Ghost is 'bout it
Then I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets
They said fuck you, took a sniff and then they didn't tell me
Just because you left home, this is Tone...Yo you see I flip stones
Birthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned
Peerage pretty young ladies lost at six, Gucci kicks
And they picky when it come to they dick
If y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well
Free tales, sweet smells, slee? well hear bells
Before you sleep read your books like it was mah fanmail
And when you wake ? you woman the whole world can tell
Word life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop
College girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop
And all I ask in life's for you to be careful
Stay focused, take care of your health
Have kids and marry a prince
Good luck and happiness
And no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow
The sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow
And maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library
You got the right conversation, education, and looks
With the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks
Baby get on your feet, be an acocuntant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid
Computer wizard, you about to get paid...
[Outro, over background singing]
Yea...
You know I just met y'all
And I love y'all already and all that
But I gotta get off that nose candy
To make it in life and all that shit...
That's why I'm here
I'm like a father figure and all that shit
I let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but...
YaknawhaI'msayin?
Cuz I drop jewels all over the place
Y'all too pretty for that...
Some of y'all nose hairs is burnt
I just want you to snap out of it
You know why...cause youse a...

Yo... who the fuck brought me this chocolate shit, man?
I said a banana nutriment, man
Ya'll heard the fuck I said... I gave you.
I wrote it on the fuckin' paper, man
Ya'll muthafuckas always fuck around and forgettin' something and shit
Smart dumb niggaz and shit, runnin' around here and shit
Ya'll niggaz need to wisen up, man, yo..
Fuck that special ed, shit
[Ghostface Killah]
I said Big O, hydro-face, pass me the sazone, it's on
There go son, tap out the hash bone
Half moon, he rock, three's fourth quarter length
No jewels, no rocks, it's not worth the spotlight
His gun tool, was a half a hill
That's a six digit slip behind five sticks, eatin' steel, fuck him
We gon' -- we gon' get our money
If he front, they gon' read about the rocks in his tummy
Mouth was red, socks was bloody, fuck all the talkin'
Safety off and shit, crept out, ""What up money? Freeze!""
Don't move, turn around, act like James Brown
And get down! Get slapped with the put down
Wasn't you the same clown? Uptown, yappin'
I keep big Shirley on my side, so What's Happenin'?
Try eatin' these shells, they non fattening
After you digest gat, I'mma stomp you bastards
So take that.. blaow, blaow! Ghost, he still breathing
Blaow, blaow! Anything after that it don't matter
Your homies and your close relatives
Even them nosy ass pigs'll get splattered
It's the TH-EO-DORE, send me to Iraq I come back with don heat
Teeth, less than a week, they be callin' me
Keep with the fists, cuz I sure do cook when it's beef
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, what up? Meet, these, O.G.'s, quote these and
Baller' shit, long biscuits
Fuck around, take all your shit
Call your bluff, y'all faggots don't want no beef
Grind your teeth, and just, roll with it, don't risk it
Fuck around, and be a statistic
[Trife]
Yo, yo, niggaz ask why I use my glock
Cuz it's 2003, muthafucka, I refuse to box
I'm true to block, strip you for your shoes and socks
Remove your watch, yo I'mma have to lose your top
I'm from a place where chunkheads and zombies dwell
And niggaz keep they heat blazin' like laundry wells
Don't ever talk to a nigga like I'm one of your kids
Cuz I'll cock back the mag and pop one in your ribs
So homeboy, keep runnin' your jibs, I'mma run in your crib
Pistol whip you right in front of your wiz
My nigga, that's how it is, I get it, just how I live
Cuz me without a gun, is like Queens without the bridge
Classic cut, this is how a O.G. live
Lamp in village, and still get heard with no spins
This is Trife Diesel, New York's backbone, back home
Black blown, it's Theodore, nigga, fuck your wack stones
[Chorus 2X]
[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
That's right, it's real!
It's that muthafuckin' Theodore Unit
Nahwhatimean? Staten Island, live shit, y'all
Straight up and down, nothin' but that cutthroat shit
Blowin' niggaz back home, you know what I mean?
I don't give a fuck... we could take it there
Whatever, peace, we got him nigga
Yeah, now I'mma strangle it there
No doubt, it's real right now, muthafucka

The Specialist who eyeballed the mistress necklace
Perpetuous, this curly head kid's treturous
Leggo the Eggo, so we can dip dip dive the gleego
Throwin' can-can, eat that plus this instrumental
Awwww Shit say Stark-aligist, Starks-aligist
Fried fish halibut
pull out the bull horn
and celebrate like Kunta was born
we elbowed our way inside loud and got on

who wanna rhyme? who wanna challenge the swordsman?

Vampire Curse disperse on each verse
Swim in black water, act slaughter through my earth
You're hit by my element Great Wall of China

Measure on my mic stand, molecule and strand
Finger rollin' rhythm ride the horse one hand
Golden Eye, Spy vs. Spy, guilty of suspicion
Chess boxer, mic in dead body position
40 oz. Ciga-art, three verse invented
divine universal black man representin'
Similar the pure, rhyme blowin out the pore
Battery in the back, keep it charged for the raw

Fully woven Beethoven, hit you on a humble

Holding the wheel, still burning the swishes
Exotic killas who bribe to kill us, and we pay for a tab

Cuz, if Lil' Jon, can ice his cup

See I'm a threat when it comes to rocks
At 3 A.M., you like damn, who put the sun on the block
Is he crazy? Illuminate like the Son of God
And still pull up in the hoopted out rented car
With dust and weed on him, knock the neighborhood bully out
Take his gun and pee on him
The magazines cant develop my flicks
The negatives came, and printed out them c-note chips
Keep the heat flaming, beats banging, bottle of weed stanking

Burn 'em like bacon, some want Satan
In the hell fire, screaming, yo I'm sorry for faking, baking

Crack heads get knocked out, right in front of the school
Slap 'em Sheek, wake his ass up, he can't even move
Cereal box is crack and ratchets, in the cocaine spot
My fiends'll box filled with coke head classics
Dope money, flood me rags of kush, heavy drags
Bodegas, I'm mad, my older sister Patty's a butch
Guns come out like my mother's teeth, watch how I'm throwing heat
The leg gravy be steaming over smothered beef
From eight-ball jackets to cops and robbers
My last drug run, I threw in two bricks to garbage
I wash my money in Woodlife, dunyy, sippin' on Folgers

[Cappadon] You know how we do!
[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef]
Yo, what's the deal Goldielochs?
Ain't buttin I'm just hibernatin love that watch
Pour me some Scotch and cold Courvesoir out
No doubt, have a chair Boo lets get to prolly in
Who you wit? Me and Molly and some trick from Yugoslavia
What fabric is that? It's only woolen Rayon
Lipstick crayon fly, Vere on ice spray on
I'm gettin tipsy, I hope she read cocks like a gypsy
and transport bricks steal in many fifties
Fuck negociatin is you wit me is you waitin
Sweet as carrot cake, fakin plus you don't eat turkey bacon
I don't get down like that, I don't get down neither
Cuban Linx skeezer, why you actin like a rap teaser
I'm like the jury exchanged plus arranged
Nigga you small change I only fuck with figaro chains
Analyzin Miss Clairol, fendi down mascara on
Assistant manager in Paragon

Say goodbye...
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Love was never born...
[Verse Two: Cappadonna]
Socializin, vibin with my eyes on dot
She this book cover lady that be blowin up the spot
While my heart was racin, like the hands on the clock
I step live I think she see me puttin out the pot
Peace Dot, I'm so happy to see you at the rendezvous
How's life today your hands are softer than Camay
too your hairdo way more class than Halle Berry
Caught visions of me and you ridin on the ferry
Plus your daughter Kiki talk to my man Merry
I order me a Sex on the Beach with the cherry
I order her a Vermidi on ice, sounds nice
She elegant, pretty eyes, glasses, inteligent
Whispered in my ear that she's celibate
Whispered back to her ear we don't have to go there
As I grab the hand set her politely in the chair
As we stopped to stare at one another
Black sister, the brother
I'm thinkin all the time how she could be my lover
[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Just another helpless
Fool in love is what I am
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Love was never born to say, goodbye
Just another helpless
Fool in love is what I...

What's happenin brown sugar? Say you look so good today
Ankle bracelet rapt around your leg
Here have a seat, complementary drinks is on me
Bartender Chevalier chateaux at table three
Luxurious rings, eyes sparkling
What's your name sugar? Juanita Cash Hawkins
Your complexion gives a reflection of
sometime a black woman just need to be loved
Quiet and shy, baby girl my gift got you high
Made you wanna hit me with the keys to that file
Just jokin baby, I have a sharp sense of humor
Wish I woulda bumped into your frame a lot sooner
What's your physical degree, thirty one, thirty three
Half Hawaiian with a slight touch of Chinese
Seen you workin at a law firm, on Fifth Avenue
Three blocks from the Gucci spot is where I trapped you
Yo, I'm all into older woman, who's happy livin
Love kids and, keep all up and this in the crib and
not afraid to doubt need a God on your side
We holdin hands til death do us apart and then we slide
Earring in the left side of your nose love my combo
Should have left wizard thousand times maybe tonight though
But you sexy mothafucka DAMN whats the recipe
You make a nigga wanna GOD DAMN
Can you cook darlin, at the stove you're revolvin
Bake macaroni, turkey wings, a nigga starvin
Here take my number let me pull the chair from under
I had fun plus your backyard speak with thunder
[Chorus: Teddy Pendergrass]
Love was never born to say, goodbye [5x]
Just another helpless fool in love is what I am [repeat to fade]

No girl can freak me, I'm just too nasty
Lost on the dance floor as I attack y'all

Tired of roaches and tired of rats

You hear the feelin' - snatch that boy

Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boom bum
She had a ass like Deborah Cox, face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
And times she got my ding-a-ling hard
When she said push hard, she kept vaseline
Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back
Now held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rockin wallows
Drawin crads, sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goines
Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins
Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss
Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bounched off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke
Girl's so pretty, kids with little niddys
Hope the years go slow, slow
Surrounded by intelligence, life through education
Healthy minds will grow, grow
Catch me on a bus-stop, dustin, cursin out
The cops are still coming, vibe with me
Everybody's talking about Wu-Tang fronting
But you still telling lies to me
Beautiful in lightshows, having no intentions on love
But having strung eyes of oppose, here we go
It's not the way she bubbed the gum, shooked her ass
I'm not the one, double dus, waiting for the bus
The faggot Nore son, now year later
Lady 7th floor, building 7-80
Fancy fox, booties for her socks, nothing else can change me
Young Nefertiti, knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree, she's a capricorn
I really liked the girl, had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got (""powered"")
But hating, was Shinene and Grace and Key-lolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit
Eh yo, the bitches started swinging and shit
So I jumped in
Those were the days, made faces in school plays
Paper trays, city wide test, made half a days
Shooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga, I'll pop her cherry for her
Fresh air fun, here's dunn, alphabets, berets
Jellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings
Eh yo, I hit that shit, got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broked her chicko's sticks
[Outro: Ghostface Killah]
Guys and girls, y'all remember those days, and shit
Girls walk around in school, one ponytail with the beret
Next looking like baby powder, youknowhatImean?
Those were the days right there
Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy
YouknowhatImean? You'd just come in school for half days, and all that
Just to see that little girl right there, ? to this
Go home and think about it, youknowhatImean?
May hump the bed sometimes on her, youknowhatImean?
Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G
That shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom, youknowhatImean?
Might get a little, go to the G.O. Store or something, youknowhatImean?
Word, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something, youknowhatImean?
A little buttercrunch joints or something, youknowhatImean?
That's that real shit, G I miss those shits, man
I wanna go back to school, man
That's my word, man
For real y'all, those were, those were the... goddamn y'all, you remember...

Told him it was no cut to be careful, he took a hit, Woodrow damn you

And snatched up his coke napkin, with dick snots hangin from his nose

Told him play the window, keep your eyes on that Verizon truck
Every fiend that walk through the door, check if he wired up
No shorts, only give him a play if he buy enough
Cop ten, hit him off with a brand new stem
Our shit is mad potent, one hit they coughin up phlegm
Make sure you get that hundred beans from Pam

Light up the mic God, knowledge this

Play it God, he pack over the shoulder
Chrome tanks, player like Yanks, check the franchise
Front on my guys, my enterprise splash many lives
Rapel on fakes like reflectors
He had sugar in his ear in his last crack career
We can can him, manhandle him, if you wanna
run in his crib-o, get ditto, skate like a limo
And jet to the flyest estate, relate take a break
Break down an eighth and then wait drop it like Drake
Thugs they be booing and screwing, we canoeing
Claim they doin the same shit we doin, fuck your unit
It's the same style, RZA trainable, jump the turnstyle
On the alley tried to challenge God for the new vials
Especially that, aluminum bat in the act
Relax, lay back, sell a grenade a day, it pays black

The Wally kid count crazily grands with our plans
Layin with my bitches and my mans in Lex Lands

Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive

Aiyo, I used to get a threesome, every other weekend
Cheated on my girl til we nearly stopped speaking
She broke down and cried, and it hurts so bad
Her friends went and told her I was a brand new dad
Of course, she knows now, I ain't used no bag
My excuses, I couldn't cum like that
She warned me of days like this, if this should happen
She'll be out, and we'll be the ones, sharing the napkin
Silly dilly me, didn't follow the instructions
Don't bring nothing home, I don't wanna hear nothing
But brought to the world, innocent, two month old
Little girl, but what am I to do? Yo, I lost my boo

Nah that shit don't add up, what am I to do, yo, I lost my jewel

Right next to the thieves, the cons, the lifers
For mad years, you held you down, I'mma overwhelmed in pain
And the worst time to leave you, now

I appreciate your concern and support for me
Most important, your honesty and trust, your heart's incredible
This the truth spilling out of my guts
If I, would of took the chance to see
What was place right in front of my face
For sure, nine out of ten times
My accent's wouldn't allow me to be so naive
And blind, to carry out these mistakes
I'm cheating, running around, blasting my gun
For me, my rep on the streets like touching a son
You like a fingerprint, I never find a match like you
Thanks for your patience, you find a man, I hope it's true
Chorus
She was screaming out the window, I was walking up the block
Throwing out my Timbos, and all my clothes
She said, if my, apoligies
She said, the lost won't fit those
And I said, baby, now let me explain
I know I had fucked up, it was a one time thing
So take all the time you need in this life
And if you let me do it over, I promise to do it right
Chorus
Hello baby, I'm sorry for everything that just been going on lately
You know, I've kinda been stressed out
I've been thinking about the things I did to you lately and
Not listening when you was telling me to chill
Now I wind up in here, it's like
You remember, listen boo, listen
The way you rub my face, the way you talk to me
The way you look at me, I know ain't no girl in the world gon' ever give me that
Like the way you gave it to me
So right now I'm pleading, and this is my word on everything

They came out of eye, face to face, they embraced
Gel blew a kiss and looked Spoon girl in the face
Her face lit up, and grinned with a smile like what?
That sneaky f--k, same bitch that got my man hit up
Out in Brownsville, where the thug life live to kill
Where bodies is worth two for five cause it's real
Fast life...
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast life, that's the only thing I know
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast Life, that's the only life I know
[Verse Two: Andre Rison]
Yo my man got more power than gunpowder with ammunition
Blowin up the fireworks and the n----z ambitions
On the come up, she gettin done up, behind closed doors
Doin freaky s--t, on elevator floors
I want her, like Sonny wanted Cher
She was his diamond piece, sex wasn't for lease
Rest in peace, somebody came up deceased
R.I.P. on that grave of the slave of infatuated ways
God couldn't save
F-A-K-E, L-O-V-E
Fake love you see
Never lasting through eternity
Living life in the fast lane
The fast life... it's the fast life
Fast life
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast life, that's the only thing I know
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast Life, that's the only life I know
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast life, that's the only thing I know
Fast life, cause there's nowhere I can go
Fast Life, that's the only life I know

[Interlude]
(, You know they're killers themselves,People die
for them. You know, guys that I fooled with were killers themselves want it?
how you want it? stop that!, stop that!
These are the men who lead the crime families of America. I control 26,000
men. Except for dope, we operate in all aspects of organized crime. And if
there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that drugs destroy your mind. And destroy
your home. In the end it'll only lead our country into ruin).....
[GHOSTFACE KILLAH]
We eat fish, tossed salads and make rap ballads
The biochemical slang lord'll throw the arrows in the dope fiend
Vocal chords switch laser beams my triple sevens
Broke the slot machines out in Queens, Grey Poupon is rebel on rap
Smack on, swing like batons, most want niggas smoked like Hilshire Farms
Check the gun we sew, underneath my shoe lies the tap
That attract bow-legged bitches with wide horse gaps
In steel mills iron he'll smoke the blow on Duns
You run heroins, Primatine mist is afraid of my lungs
Turn my channel, it'll blow your whole bench off the panel
Like 80 roman candles that backfired then slammed you
Every day is like a video shoot, check this shit
I take you back to Playboy, stash guns and whips
Picture afro, big shish-ka-bobs and daishikis
1000 civil marched blazed their fists in early sixties
[CAPPADONNA]
Now check this one, you must have been stupid to miss this one
'Donna shogunnin' flip a ton of fashion
Destination be the cash when I step past one
Don't make me blast one, I'm cold like eskimo flow
Cappadonna stay chillin' take shots of penicillin
Clean out and let the steam out, she fiend to blow out
But I'm equipped with mad white, Morris The Rap got nine lives
I'll take a few hundred-thousand dollar dives
and then I still never go down
Until the last round I shine,
when RZA do his thing motherfucka, I'ma do mine
[RAEKWON]
Now, where I come from cats be carryin' Marryin' drug money
Fuck up your wife, get four to life, claim we handling
Midtown niggers scramblin', moving examine the fly shit
Plus quick to buy shit Chef, yeah, you know the whole gods
Asterick, Fidel Castro suits plus depositin' cash rule big time
Play it like Canadian wine, RZA 's the rhyme now, the sacredness of
one's true mind Now let's get colorful like money green
High roller coaster, Sosa, million dollar nigger roaster
Yeah, GOD, be havin' my whole steez laced
now let's wrap our tapes, connect dots
aim Glocks train style, Figaro fly jewel
Tri-color Cubans swervin we'll pow with Germans in Suburbans
24 niggas with vests's on, my own restaurant
Dons sendin' my sons membership forms
They still gettin' this paper scraper
Fake haters from Jamaica, wizards be passin like Lakers
And if you comin' from Lex, Lewis, Rich Liberace
Fetus style and block your goals like hockey....

Pull down your little red drawers and start to kiss you all over
You hope it ('last, forever') I know baby, I hope it ('last, forever')
So I, took off my paisley pajamas I got from St. Thomas
Yo, I love you so much, so let me pay homage
And if you do, yo I promise never break a promise
So can I give you the honors my little Pocahontas?
Play by play, Miss Camay
You like a Zales Diamond in the window, right on display
You just a shining, precised in every curve you cut
And for your daddy, yo, you never have to tuck in your gut
Because I love it like that, stretchmark fat, plus let me show my crunches
To burn it off, just lay right on your back
And let me do my love dance, I pop it to the left
I pop it to the right, I get it all night, come on
Chorus
Them other chicks must hail to the queen, as I
Put them dudes straight up and check, cuz the queen is mine

We can be broke, holes in our coat, even still we shine
We got each other through the bad and the best of time
(Last, forever, last, forever)
Yo, yo, I'm lost in love, with nowhere to go
She says I'm a pain in the ass, boy, get to the store
She can say that, cuz we best friends, we play together
She carry my left rib, therefore we pray together
Bury me on top of her, in our graves together
Cuz when she feel pain, I know how to make it better
Talks, some long walks, communication in parks
Understand what she's going through, our listen was smarts
Especially when she's on her friend, I be hoping it leave
I have to bite my tongue, just to keep from arguing
Six days of that is like, who let the monster in
After it's finished then, I can get on top again
Shorty girl's my oxygen, never catch her gossiping
Look it ya'll, this my flower, she gon' keep on blossiming
Long as she is mine, and I am her, we gon' ride the wind
This lady here is all for me, I never have to lock her in

Yo, summer time holdin the 9, split the Vega in half
Jeeps rumble and my dogs puff grass
Bank stoppin, high-derox hydrolic
Kid with the most knowledge will obtain to touch top dollars
Hold me down, hand me my cake, dusty, bake, activate
Fuck your corny debates
I'm like cake or maybe like $10,000 rabbits
The kid walked thru, switch up his accent ""Now I'm from Paris""
Cash the bill, frozen element, Seagal
Signs from the most high causes me to break them all
How the fuck was y'all niggas thinkin? You think I fell off the ledge?
The legendary Ghost Deini might be dead?
Never, Impossible, pull out black burners like tonsils
to gallants, hit 'em if we go to
Bustin at y'all niggas daily
Wall-to-wall, Hawkins
Suckin your teeth cuz God chain-talkin
like Ghostface this, Ghostface that
Ghost sold crack, now his revelations spoken thru rap
Valored down like the sheik of Iran
Gasoline CREAM wrapped in hospital bands
Model vans, Michael Davis, it's me against housin
Extraordinary pro-black, sold God creations to control thousands
Catch me at the flicks, Apollo rap Fredick Douglas
You know what? Eh yo, fuck this
Eh yo, how can I move the crowd?
First of all, ain't no mistakes allowed
Here's the instructions, put it together
It's simple ain't it? Well, quite clever

Marvin, Marvin, you were a friend of mine
You stood for somethin, ugh
Tupac, Biggie, ohh how we miss you so
We want y'all both to know
We really love you so
Eh yo, I'm Gucci down
Wally boot, Jamaican hat, long 4-pound
Ask niggas how I get down
Don't speak much, deluxe plush
Imaginations holdin all like Willie Hutch
You might've bumped into me on the Riker's bus
Weed in my teeths, jem in my beauty sleep, sleeve
Dead serious, knowledge by 2% triple geese
Come on, we juggle mic's
We come on all the amps, advance the final
Show these niggas how the way we dance
Hot night, Jamaica
Came thru in a boger green '68 Pacer
Had mad paper, high as a fuck
Truck, 2 rappers got stuck that night
I ain't sayin no names, they know who, thank you for the change
Outdoor event, New Year's Eve, Cali weed
30 seconds till we tear and decease
Quick, call all my seeds dipped in the crowd
The hoe spotted me, knew not to call my name out
He walked off softly, we exactly
formed like Christ and the disciples
Black fatigues, leathal-faced dunnie, he held the rifle
We had the whole shit shook, you favorite rapper's droppin they drinks
On the low, tuckin they links, we made 80 off the books
[Superb]
It's like '86, Magic Johnson, no disrespect
My metaphors'll keep out The Projects
Rap connects'll keep me correct
Eh yo, I wrote this on Donnie roof
After his funeral, on one knee
Thinkin his killer's followin me
So to my nigga Donnie, up there
Can you please tell God that we fucked up here?
We got beer, weed, guns, AIDS
All these obsticles, it's hard to make it nowadays
Watch the Devil in it, some say it's our fault
If that's the answer, you know smokin can cause cancer
Let me drop a bracelet, leave a chain behind
My tape stay at the beginnin cuz that's how they rewind
Y'all know how we dine, we don't eat swine, and we don't drink wine
If you don't bring me some motherfuckin cognac, I kill you
I can't feel you
Ain't in my senses, and you ain't in my dollars
I fuck with rockwilders, no leashes, no collars
Brolic scholars, that's Ghost Deini!

You know you just won a pair of Theodore drawers and all that
How do you feel about that? (Oh my God, that is good daddy I love ya'll)
Yeah, that's right baby, no doubt... right now, his name is Ghostface
Check this joint out right here, it's new, word up
[Ghostface Killah]
I'm the Mighty Joe Young of rap
Live off of mighty gold, tongue and yack
Ya'll be amazed how I brought it back
Two porsche's, big ass ranch with twelve horses
Scarface breeze when I speak, the all bosses
Plus the jewelry so truck, the cuffs get you nauseous
Two years, been through like six divorces
Now the talking put my business in the street, but
I'm like cement, I rock when I step
Kill music with no hands and leave with no weed stuff
Like my bitches better when they wore Reebok's
See hot, let's have a toast, I verbally bomb deacons
Have the whole church praying for Ghost
When we speak we give sermons, and switch our names over permits
The big shit, you might get burned with
God-body fly automobiles with grills
Two thousand, fifteen, nigga, we can take off the wheel
A Georget Jetson, so ya'll sit still
Chill, peace to Queens, so the God Allah reel's reel
It's the takeover, breaks over, make something
For funny ass package, who want, and a cake over
Monster bangels, bojangles got the forty cocked from all angles
Fuck a rope nigga, my gold chain'll hang you
Danish darts, language arts, slanger banger you
Punk motherfucka...

Welcome to Saturday Night Live, write rhymes
Glide on beats, and we high from the police
The dogs bark funny, in fact, when I'm clean
They can smell mark money, truck and mad bummy
Off the peter, grab shoots, Cerebel Paisley
Gats, pull out the mack on cancer, the oo-wop
I bag down AIDS, word to the U.S.
There's no need to panic, yo, we been through a phase
Like, namebelts, got the fronts in Alfa Romeo's
Tent the patrol niggas, that we had on a payrole
I play on niggas like stop and go
And tell the other liquors that Don pop more
And Venus told Mercury she a hot ho
Me, I'm just thinkin' bout what's next for Ghost
The Enterprise worth billions, delay America
To Africa, home away, the six text-tillion
Turn, Siskel and Ebert givin' two thumbs
New York Times call it my best work, bump to it
You can Rolling Stone every bone, and kill 'em at the Grammy's
Have 'em sit down, polly with the top five families
Blocka-blocka, boom, now they all dead
Now I'm the only one gettin' that bread, that's right
And the only one rockin' those threads
See these cowards let the fuckin' lead go to they head

And Ghost knows when you are awake
And I know if you been bad or good

Man, woman, child
The book of life
Starks Enterprise!
Take out the rap kingpin, the black Jesus
I know a few niggas sniff coke and caught seizures
Peace to ten thousand seaters
And all y'all pretty ass Libras
My Tommy dick'll blow y'all ass to pieces
I love fuckin with y'all I got the George Jeff walk
Look how I dance, favorful robes, bows and all sorts
Hold on, who turned the lights on?
Word to my microphone and preach on
Brother, that's that bullshit in my right arm
Crackhead stop it, dope pusher stop it
The father sent me a message and I came to drop it
The prophet is to love each other
Michael Jordan/Jackson, Cosby money, Oprah
They got our love by go get Africa
Harmony, grits, welfare cheese
Whips, cheque data first in the fifth
What Ghost?
Fuck y'all niggas an' fuck y'all bitches an'
Fuck the pictures y'all takin, fuck the whip you in
Starsky bring home the dough now the show is over
(It's over) It's over? (It's over) It's over?
Timberland, crack snorkels, jewels, cash insurance
Tai hold, fly clothes and El Deramo
5 plus 5 O's, one plus 9 O's
Save our self, reach our goals
What if the BIBLE wasn't good?
And good was bad, as bad as it should
It matters, feed em power food
The wonders that Allah will do
Maybe he'll discover you
Look 'em like a couple of jewels
Ticket traum' was old, that plus the God ain't loved the way I move
People see me, G. Deini
He beeny on the cell, seen me?
You need me, you read me
Captain over, get that weed to me
The champion, the vigilante
Ask me what the surface could be
In me like Marcus Camby
Hear me, I fuck with family
Dons, chew on this, the hit list got
All of your names, so y'all lames is hist'
I kissed the bangin-est bitch (all night) that's famous for her tits
Not that tall doofy chick in your hood called Snitch
Come on!
Bentleys for sharp shoes
Similac, Huggies, big Shizam jewels
Infrared shootin at niggas
We back execution niggas
Markin it mummy, he money, he fly bummy
Super wizzers, look like Luther bitches
Still catches ill inventions
Strength, real niggas holdin blitz as real as ninjas
So illable, wheel of promotin like Benz dealer
Instiller, get real for hugs, lets chill feel I'm ill with colour
Yo bacon, straight cake, layin on my paper aces
Fuck all your under statements
Battle us? Battle gauges
A big mansion, real product of the strip scampy
Cell boat, big yacht, and beige Hummer
Summer home, big stones and cologne
Remember heroes? I guess them corner days is gone
Mommy got a house, Daddy got a house
Granny got a house, we moved out
That's right, we moved out
Now that's what I'm talkin about
Smackin all y'all stars and chumps
Gettin cash in the larger sums
Shootin dice in the church with nuns
We come with the biggest guns

[Shawn Wigs:]
I know she gone, but I'm still holding on
Still smell the scent of her clothes, only God knows the pain
I cried til there's no tears left
Love my babies, we can't explain why she left
I'm all alone, feeling like my heart is blown
I do anything, just to see her come back home
But she chose not to hold on, and broke the bond
Left me with two babies like I'm Mr. Mom
But I'm handle what God gave me, cuz I'm a good man, and
Try to break me down, I'm strong and stay standing
Never imagine she gettin' down like that
Nine years in this together and you turning your back? Come on
[Chorus: Eamon (sample)]
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is hold on) That's what I'm do, yeah
(All we can do is) Hold on, yeah
(All we can do is) I'mma try to (Hold on) hey
[Shawn Wigs:]
I can't believe you walked out of my life
Not saying I was perfect, babe, but I was willing to work it
I know the grass look greener, but you should of stayed beat
Let a good man go, so you can run free?
Could of held on, to these rough times, and made better ones
You left me when my music was down with no fun
Broke, I struggled so you made it through college
Cuz I had street smarts, but you had knowledge
Longevity, suppose to be together forever
Now you say we growing apart? Whatever, whatever
So I'mma open the cage and set my butterfly free
Just hoping it ain't too late when you come on back to me
[Chorus: w/ Eamon ad-libs]
[Eamon:]
But I'mma try to, hold on, and be strong
Cuz this time, you're so wrong
But I wait, and, I long
For you touch, but you're gone
All these tears, and all this pain
I'll never, never, feel the same
I keep control, I lift my soul
I sing my song, I hold on

[Intro: Trife Da God]
Uh-huh, whoo, just smoothing it out, right now
My nigga Halloween, we gon' get rich this year, nigga (see)
Sip on this little bit of odor, made brown
Zone out, turn the lights off
Ant boogie, what up? Uh-huh
[Trife Da God:]
In the crib, with my wiz, getting my grown man on
Listening to classic soul, with the slow jams on
Smokey Robinson, Tears of a Clown, shedding tears
Popping beers, almost twenty five years in the town
I seen niggaz die off, like dandelions in the fall
Niggaz heard of Chip Banks and left him lying in the hall
Your boy Sandy Brock was ill, like Kobe Bryant with the ball
It's no exceptions, even the biggest giants gotta fall
Cuz we living in denial, but these lessons are vital
When marinating in the slums, you gotta practice survival
Now everybody wants to be next American idol
But these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green, knahImean?
Being rich is a poor man's dream, and we all wanna shine
But we all can't green...
[Chorus: Solomon Childs]
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
But I ain't been to many operas
Or had money for private doctors
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown
I grew up hard, maybe you grew up harder
The message is I'm too strong to hold down
I know the ledge, and I ain't planning to drown
As harsh it sound, these just a tears of a clown
[Trife Da God:]
Momma ain't raised no fool, they say we gotta save the children
But first, we gotta save our spoons
I was taught not to waste my food
Even if I didn't like it, every scrap on my plate got chewed
Either you ate, or you didn't eat, the memories are bitter sweet
Used to get teased by my friends, cuz I had bigger feet
I think about them jokes and laugh, crack a smile
Cuz as a child, I never knew that being broke was bad
Growing up I was close to my dad, but that still didn't stop a nigga
From putting that coke in them bags
That was the past, now, I'm riding with the oak in the dash
Got jealous niggaz hating, big time, hoping I crash
I can't blame 'em, and on the same note, I can't change 'em
Let a nigga disrespect my shit, I'm gonna flame 'em
That's word to my son little Jay, my little homey
Ask niggaz how your boy get down, ain't nothing phony
[Chorus]
[Trife Da God:]
Yeah, they say two heads are better than one, and in the process
I learned that slow progress, is better than none
That's why I'm still here persuing my goals, baking that bread
In the bakery, if I ain't out, doing no shows
I hit the block, once in a blue, and front with the crew
And show niggaz a good time, by getting drunk in the stud'
Some niggaz find happiness, with a blunt and a brew
They talented niggaz, but they just need something to do
It's kinda hard try'nna look beyond buildings and bricks
We can't condone broken homes, when our children is sick
Try'nna survive off the cereal and milk from the WIC
And all the good ones we got, be getting killed in the mix
He could of been the next Jordan, who knows, the next Emmitt
Young Tiger Woods, or the new Arthur Ashe of tennis
That's why I'm looking past the gimmicks, getting cash with Dennis
Criminal grind, we gonna smash the business
[Chorus]
[Outro: ?]
Yeah, when you see that big thing pull up
Don't be mad at us, man, be glad, we done made it from the projects
We done came up, Stapleton Houses, man
Straight up, Theodore, Toney Starks Enterprise

Fuck... fuck is these niggas at, man
""Please check the number or try your call again""
(Aiyo, hello?) Aiyo, bring that shit (what happen, son?)
That's my word, yo, these niggas is fronting out here (where at, where you at?)
I'm in Jersey, you know where the fuck I'm at, nigga, I'm in Jersey
(Aight, so, what happen though, man, what happen?) I need that shit
I tell you when you get here, don't even worry about that shit
(Aight yo, I'll be right there, man) Just hurry the fuck up, bring
that big joint
(That's my word) Yeah (one) Yeah
In the crib on this rainy day, I'm chilling
Glass pianos and Portuguese drapes, hang from the ceiling
Persian rugs, Moroccan sofas
I walk to the house in paisley robes and Ferragamo loafers
And Iron Chef just season the salmon
It's coming down pouring, he watching BBC, eating a salad
I'm on the couch hitting the chalice
Checking my textes and out of nowhere, my dick is hard as a callus
I stood up, pulled back my sleeve, checked my watch
Where the, fuck is my wife, it's 12 o'clock on the dot
Very impatient, I'm getting nervous, can't stop pacing
My heart's racing, her Nextel don't get no service
Damn, all this over a gallon of milk
Something, happened to her, somebody wig'll get peeled
Okay, let me calm down, maybe she at Keeba house
Her birthday's today, we both bought her jeans and a blouse
Since 7 o'clock, she been gone for Owls
Jetted up the steps to the master suite, checked the shower
Nope, all that is there is towels and soap
Stomach is nauseous, caught a big lump in my throat
Found a phonebook with mad names, looked down
Bow, there go Keeba, tying my shoes, I put the bitch on speaker
And bluntly adressed her, 'where's my girl?' (Yeah, she ain't out here)
(Last time I seen her, Ghost, she beat it on an old nigga)
Yo, Keeba stop playing, yo (Nah, we took a shot of Henn')
(Lately she work out by 10, I told her, bitch, buy a Benz)
(Or even shot a car, I'm getting me some Advil)
(Show these muthafuckas, how Keeba love to drive stick)
I snatched up my raincoat, the grass was soaked
Under the bed in the guest house, where I keep my toast
I yelled to the Chef, yo, watch for Kayla, check the pool and the bowling alley
If anything, just hit my cellular
Hopped in the go cart, the yard is dark, I'm bugging
Few feet from the guest house, is where I parked
Hope she's OK, is what I say in my heart
But something don't feel right, so is what I'm saying to God
As I got closer, something ain't kosher
I heard a bunch of squeaky sounds from the house, I don't think I'm suppose to
Is this the end, of the Starks regime?
Let me find out somebody on my ground, yo, is pounding my queen
Yo, I'mma kill, yo! (Hold on, cuz)
{Baby, let me explain, you over reacting, that's not what it was}
Shut the fuck up, you got caught moaning with your legs up
Eyes all red, what? Did ya'll just blaze up?
Then froze for a sec, so I dipped quick, lift the mattress
Aimed the biscuit at both of them bastards
What ya'll excuse now (Yo, cuz, she said she live with her pop)
(Her dude mad strict, that's why we up in the spot)
(And yo, this little trick of yours, bought me a ten G watch)
He reached down for his drawers, thats' when I let off a shot
Back the fuck up, snatched his covers
Had 'em looking like the black Adam & Eve, some sinful lovers
(Chill, Tone, put the gun down) How you know my name, son?
{Hold on, let me explain} Yo, ya'll two is done
(Just let me put my drawers, get dressed, before I get rocked)
(Cuz real talk, is looking like you trynna let off that glock)
Yeah, you right, you look familiar, you put my cable in, right?
The FiOS nigga, and you fucking my wife?
(Yeah, I put that cable in, nigga, we both got caught)
(And she a triflyn ass chick, don't act like it's all my fault)
{Baby, no} Mind your business
(Now Kayla, don't stop him, let the sucker do what he do)
(He touch me, and he finished)
What, nigga, hold that, eat it
(Oh shit, what the fuck) You forgot your drawers
And your little tools, nigga
You FiOS mustache wearing muthafucka, I got you nigga
(Fuck you, nigga, I'mma see you nigga)
(Fucker, fuck) That's why you dive out the window

You know you just won a pair of Theodore drawers and all that
How do you feel about that? (Oh my God, that is good daddy I love ya'll)
Yeah, that's right baby, no doubt... right now, his name is Ghostface
Check this joint out right here, it's new, word up
I'm the Mighty Joe Young of rap
Live off of mighty gold, tongue and yack
Ya'll be amazed how I brought it back
Two porsche's, big ass ranch with twelve horses
Scarface breeze when I speak, the all bosses
Plus the jewelry so truck, the cuffs get you nauseous
Two years, been through like six divorces
Now the talking put my business in the street, but
I'm like cement, I rock when I step
Kill music with no hands and leave with no weed stuff
Like my bitches better when they wore Reebok's
See hot, let's have a toast, I verbally bomb deacons
Have the whole church praying for Ghost
When we speak we give sermons, and switch our names over permits
The big shit, you might get burned with
God-body fly automobiles with grills
Two thousand, fifteen, nigga, we can take off the wheel
A Georget Jetson, so ya'll sit still
Chill, peace to Queens, so the God Allah reel's reel
It's the takeover, breaks over, make something
For funny ass package, who want, and a cake over
Monster bangels, bojangles got the forty cocked from all angles
Fuck a rope nigga, my gold chain'll hang you
Danish darts, language arts, slanger banger you
Punk motherfucka...

All of your fushu, I got gats, Ghostface that
But your rhymes ain't workin' now, look who's hurtin' now
I had to shut you down, I had to shut you down
Welcome to Saturday Night Live, write rhymes
Glide on beats, and we high from the police
The dogs bark funny, in fact, when I'm clean
They can smell mark money, truck and mad bummy
Off the peter, grab shoots, Cerebel Paisley
Gats, pull out the mack on cancer, the oo-wop
I bag down AIDS, word to the U.S.
There's no need to panic, yo, we been through a phase
Like, namebelts, got the fronts in Alfa Romeo's
Tent the patrol niggas, that we had on a payrole
I play on niggas like stop and go
And tell the other liquors that Don pop more
And Venus told Mercury she a hot ho
Me, I'm just thinkin' bout what's next for Ghost
The Enterprise worth billions, delay America
To Africa, home away, the six text-tillion
Turn, Siskel and Ebert givin' two thumbs
New York Times call it my best work, bump to it
You can Rolling Stone every bone, and kill 'em at the Grammy's
Have 'em sit down, polly with the top five families
Blocka-blocka, boom, now they all dead
Now I'm the only one gettin' that bread, that's right
And the only one rockin' those threads
See these cowards let the fuckin' lead go to they head
I needed to scream on all ya'll bitches, birds
But the more you bite my style, the more I learn
Your rhymes ain't workin' now, look who's hurtin' now
I had to shut you down, I had to shut you down
God, yeah, party people
You are now listenin' to the sounds of Ghost Radio
777 F.M. and all that, no doubt
It's real right about now, yeah
The dance floor is packed and all that
Everything lookin' glory, I see asses
I see glasses in the air, yo, put your hands in the air
Come one, let me hear you see Theodore, ""Theodore""
Theodore, ""Theodore"", yeah, yeah
That was chunky and all that
No doubt, but yo, where Staten Island at?
Where ya'll at? Make some noise, yo, yo, come on
Yeah, check-check-check-check me out
Check-check-checkin' me out, come on

With a .45 steel erection
Eagle on, Kangol hat slanted, coconut, bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions, like Flava Flav clock, yo

Rip they guts out, like a hysterectomy
When beef collide, look on the flip, buy a penitentiary kite

I hold you down when you be squeezing that lead
Shopping sprees, with my mans on the corner watch D's
Rolling in threes, in them purple capri's'
A gritty bop, my rocks is bigger, wallo's with the gold tassels
Your old slave, with Starkey Love on the shackle
And I stay fly underwater, my toes is iced out

Get my slippers, before I go gun ho!

Un-smacked him on purpose and see this drunk come and berp us
Paper chasers, Starky stayed up in the makings

Cellphones is blowin', the crews not available
Ask 'Donna, word in the town, we the realest dudes

Clap for my baby, award winning, best nookie
I been in the whole wide world, that's why I stay spending
Chorus
I want you in a scarf, boy shorts around the house
Wife beater, undercover, sitting on the couch
Isley's is playing, lights dim, vanilla candles is melting
It's a long time, don't let no one else in
Fresh out the tub, sweetness and peaches
Body work splash around your neck, the kid admire all your features
Niggas be hollering; peace ma, what up boo?
You suck your teeth and keep it moving with the screw, yes
Chorus
Happy birthday, red roses, big cakes
Donna Karen slippers, got your birthday gift by the lake
Big boats, thick ropes, ostrich purses
Snakeskin boots, Jared Jewelers, the mink cost mad loot
Ski trips, resorts, close your eyes, baby, make a wish
Blow your cake out, earrings is snowflaked out
Will you marry me? Will you carry me?
Through rain, hail, sleet and snow
Don't say no, you'll embarass me
Chorus
I'll be that...
Baby...
Yeah, yeah, yeah...
I'll be that, I'll be that...

Walked up Dr. Jay's, five niggas with K's
Son, they feelin' ya waves, it's like mayonaisse
Old people love you, corns on they feet
Fifteen, twenty deep, you walked in, cross streets
Walk 'em through red lights, Shaolin through Crown Heights
Even had 'em on bikes, they was starting fights
New Year's had 'em all drunk, lazy eye Milton
Found a pump, tired of busting 'em
Scotty snatched Janet's wig off, that night, shit got hectic
Barbara Jean fuckin' old man Shet
Good God, shit's real as a fuck, throw a buck
On Chuckle-Up, Thunderbird in cuffs
Skeeter with no teeth, night train lips
Beefin' with police, Grady hit knees
Dude blew a bag with him, he got butt naked in the 'villes
Plus he fucked a whitey in the hill
Throw a buck on, Chuckle-Up, Thunderbird in cuffs

I think it happened on a Saturday
I heard the phone ring, ding, ding
Who this? 'Vine yo..
Wise guy killed last night by the Tracks,
It was the same who our niggas teeth up
Sent 'em back, we shoulda thrilled a long time ago
We went this recording, now we owe
The devil slit trough, without an intro
Yo 'Vine, it can't be!
Wise guest-starring me
Can it be, we both got hit
God legendary, he and General
He survived A-dog,
Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs
He stayed in his world
And he sidely sweard
To tell the truth, that DeVon was like
""Your out of cure boo""
Wisegod Allah, warrior
XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne
Touched something for you
Ya stupid fail niggas fucked up
Becouse bitches is talking
They living, i'm twisting
You alleybag
You killed my man, you killed my man
And you sent him back
After this day, watch your hats
Slugs flying everywhere,
You could smell heaven in the air
You can never get the god, yeah
Now i'm cypher,
You've been driving off the same battery
We had, back in '91 that got you hyper
God been beautiful, god been great
God fed you, you died but we survived that day
You killed your king, Rakeem Allah
Gave him his life, he was your offspring
Camouflage dog, days was green
One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil
Yo, that's my fam, we snatch me out of big head van
We tought you how to get gain, from sayin' ""peace god""
As long we translate Allah's tounge, spit the language hard
Alley thoughts, identical twin
My alias gasanate, the days close,
The days close, how'd you know!

Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone..
I know I'm gonna see, a better day
I know I think I'm crying, becouse of you
I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry

You switch up, last week you burned a old lady's retina
I thought them thick Coke bottle jammies might protect her
But it didn't Pah, the lady's blind and it's all your fault
It went down to jury court and you walked
On stage you fuck with nigga's faces, glaciers
Hittin off with Cristal bottles, bing wind up in the basement
Very expensive championship
Chip Rocks known for his wedding day, bitches give you props
Look you tied a knot, understand you hot; you got my man popped

Well, I ain't got no fuckin' time to play witchu! Now gimme the message.
Willie's in Warwick, doin' 1-3. Told me to tell y'all motherfuckers to

Naw, that's out, man. You know? What can we, The Lords, do with a punk like

Yo, Gambino niggas who swipe theirs
Deluxe rap cavaliers
Midgets who steal beers, give 'em theirs
[Chorus: Raekwon]
Sit back jollyin'
My team be gamin' like three card Rolly an'
Drug Somalians pollyin'
[Verse One: Raekwon]
Many raps they crochetin'
Ay yo Iron, these niggas portrayin'
But haven't been payin'
For real, slide on these niggas like flesh fear
Caesar fade style, usually tough grenade
Throw a blade, fuck gettin' laid
Guzzle this shit like Gatorade
Big-dick Wallies have never half-suede
Connectin' with the hot style is done
Light up a chalis
I run with nuttin' but the wildest, foulest
Come on now, long-dick style
Niggas on the hit out, ay yo Iron bite my shit out
Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M.
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on
When I go bury me wit Valow on
(They come to me, and understand, just let me get mines first. Then after I
get mines, y'all can do what y'all wanna do. Fuck 'em up bad)
[Verse Two: Ghostface]
'Sho 'nuff, hit the bank and thrust
Cool Nauticas Jamie Summer got trained on the tour bus
We upgrade, swallow raw eggs, read the label
Hittin' white-label, left the Winnebago unstable
Smooth sailin', walked in, my earth started kneelin'
Started stealin', I'm too ill, see we're bellin' at the parlay
Kicked up, mack, max motion
Michael Bolton magazine call, I'm too potent
Louisville mix pain kill rap, Fuck benadryl
The violin in 'Knowledge God' sounded ill
Tremendously obnoxious, no blotches
My telephone watch'll leave bartenders topless
Dead on the prosecutor, smacked a juror
Me and my girl'll run like Luke and Laura
We sit back on Malayan islands
Sippin' mix drinks out of boat coconut bowls, we whylin'

Deep meditation sound orientated, war the blizzard
Rap para-medical the wizard
Cappadonna, never caterin' to none
My microphone and three verse weigh a ton of slaughter
You oughta five thousand back across the water
My laboratory story keep me flowin' with the glory
Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin'
For violatin' my position,
I leave you smoked like a crackhead on a mission
Two tokes of mic dope, one stroke of elegance
Rated like the movie graphic told intelligence
Person to person, it'd be hard for you to take a trophy
You better off to get somebody out to try to smoke me
'Cause I'm P-L-O T-K-O every day
Dancehall General, Party Fanatic Colonel
Cappadonna son'a old school just go infernal
Veteran for rappin' with the new set of rule of hard rappin'
Ninety-six jive, I keep the live crowd clappin'
When I bow, all praises due to Staten Isle
I spark the mic and Shaolin spark the methtical
Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'
From my mental slangin', bitchin' rap twist the point of warfare
I brutalize, all competition catch ill hair
Chance him, that's what they said, threw up a ransom
I jacked it, stripped the beat naked and packed it
Gimme my rewards

After the funeral I played low
Counting my last ten Gs, three weeks later yo I'm back in the {P's?}
Gathering up information, checking faces
Keeping the 45 auto loaded like it was bases
When it get dark better believe my mark
I heard a voice through a bullhorn the white man he said, ?yo Starks
You're surrounded, put down your gun look at the ruger
It's nothing but cops nigga, you better not run?

This my main bat, she thorough like that so we don't use protection
But the night before my wiz must of checked my phone
How'd she got the code? Psh, I don't know
Next thing she laying in the tel? lobby
She spotted me tipping the doorman, holding hands with my bitch beside me
My heart dropped, everything stopped, scared to death
Told my broad to keep it moving cos I just got knocked
Don't turn around, as soon as she did she bust a shot
Plus she tough security dropped when she touched the glock

Didn't say shit, not even cough or spit, my bitch was gone
There goes the car, house, {?} jury, court date, judges

Here's a little story ghetto situation
'Bout a girl I met who had many temptations
She was so fly, get high, well understood
Big-ass big brains and straight out the hood
[Ghostface]
Yo,
Aiyyo, I woke up early took a stretch and a yawn
Had a 2 o'clock appointment with this girl name Dawn
She ain't the Avon lady but her beauty was strong
Right before she went to rest she had me singin this song
she must be a special ladyyyyyyyyy
and a very exciting girlllllllllll
I don't know
she had the high-glow's switchin
see her in the club you hear others chicks bitchin
but Dawn quit to bust a bitch ass and shit
see she did 12 months over a ratchet
not no crab shit
got bagged with the mag
taxi cab shit
clit was hangin out her panties with no where to stash it
it was classic
nowadays shes laid back
helpin me perfect my rap
only pink and smoked salmon where she feed her cat
wife everything
diamond cut like johnny lex collar attached
lickin glass bowls in her cat clothes
cause crazy stacks
finicky thing
her kittin drink pollar spring
take naps
near her jewerly box
she play with all the rings
and when she step out the tub its like an ill flick
carmel skin, bath and body works leave the whole room lit
cinnamon candles, sweet side, they on relax mode
paint her toes on the bed slow, watchin me
versace robe on her body, peak, sippin asti (piemonte)
she a perfect 10 in my wildest dreams DAWN
[Cappadonna]
Aiyyo, she gotta be gone
Waitin on my sweet strawbeery pecan rican LaShawn
holdin my taffy down when I'm gone
three fourths of her body always covered with clothes
thats why I'm eatin her candy
and suckin her toes
sweet sexy LaShawn
she got body like whats goin on
on some marvin gay shit like lets get it onnnnn
suuuugarrrr
letssss getttt it onnnnn
ayo she a diamond in the rough
black rose in the hood
I love my queen and she treat me good
fuck cookin for me
she stash me out when the feds come lookin for me
I'm not cheatin on her or beatin on her
I spend the weekend on her
we on the block when the bills start creepin on her
she right there when it gets sticky
she strict politic to the vicky's
and a fly aviator the color of sky
god on her side
indian chick with cat eyes
mad respect with the fat thighs
plus her guns for the revolution
would straight leave her if she prostituting
yo my girls the bomb
intelligent mind
sky blue louis vetton
leg muscles, deep dimples
body is soft she smell fresh like a new born
pretty feet peitete ass nice shoes on
the sunshine for my quiet storm
keepin the food warm while I'm gone
it won't be long 'til I'm back to my sweet butter pecan rican LaShawn
Hit me up baby, P.S. Cappadon'
[Trife]
Aiyyo, aiyyo I woke up in the morning still drunk off the Henn
Had a 3'oclock appointment with this girl name Jen
You know Jen from a hundred and ten, she push the Lex Coupe
Part time fashion designer she work for Jet Blue
Pretty young thing, with a body like vida
Ass off the meter, eva medenez look, strut like a diva
Leave her shine fine, blow minds like dimes of a cheeba
She like it from behind, slow grind, sometimes with her feet up
Ms. Bonitta Applebum Bottom, thick as a Roman column
Raw dick it down, love me, even if I'm holdin condoms!
Cause she my bitch, the only cat that I lick
Throwin that ass like Ciara on the top of that whip
Latin decent, velour suit with the cameltoe print
Peppermint flared panties with the garder-belt clips
Tattoo of a small butterfly on her inner thigh
Even at my loneliest times you that Jen will ride...

Whether Jen, Don, or Shawn its the same situation

I know things seem messed up sometime
You stressed out and you can't handle the situation
Sometime it feels like you lacking the guidance
And you don't know what to do... but stay strong
And keep in mind that he always loves you...
It's what it is... that's right sugar love

Yo, I know this chick from the hood named Courtney Cox
And her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
She's awfully hot, asshole burning like tobasco
She used to be thick, it's like where the hell her ass go
Started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
Thought that she could quit but her calculations wasn't right
Infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
Prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
Putting dope in the cook, searching for her vein
Tracks all over her arms, she never felt the pain
The monkey on her back is now a gorilla
Fiending for a hit knowing one day it's gon' kill her
The clinic didn't help (nope) she just another young black woman
Destroying her pretty image and her health
Got me thinking to myself, damn, how could this happen?
I seen her on the corner, nodding off, sniffin' and scratching
[Chorus]
[Trife Da God:]
She wakes up, with an urge to get high
Everyday, the same routine, needing the mood of fix to get by
So she reaches for her purse, grab the bag and the needle
Tie a sock her arm and start shooting up the diesel
Had a flesh back, screwing some dude up in his hashback
The night before, body still sore, holding her ass crack
A regular John, she met her through Tom
She passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
Dying a slow death, oh, she losing her dear mind
From the troubles of the world, feeling cursed by mankind
Uh, caught up in a desperate rage, was blessed with AIDS
Lost her appetite, hardly slept in days
Now it's too late, praying to Jesus, she fucked around
With the wrong penis, contaminated with diseases
Two months pregnant, carrying around her fetus
But they found her on Broad, in the dumpster, behind the cleaners
[Chorus]
[Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Josephine, what's wrong, baby?
Come on...
[Ghostface Killah:]
Yo, what your momma gonna think of you girl?
Her little baby's all doped up, strung out on the world
Try'nna make some quick cash for a hit of that stash
Listen, baby, you growing up much too fast
Uh, this goes out to every project and every ghetto
For those getting high, using drugs on every level
Living your life, day and night, getting stoned
You better leave those drugs alone, feel me?
[Willie Cottrell:]
Up all night, under the party lights
Same old popping and party hopping
All of your so called friends, are leading you down the wrong road
Leading you back to crack, it's a known fact
It is time, that you need me, I'll be there, to help ya
I'll be your leaning pole when you're falling down
I'll be there, when you falling down (sooner or later)

Break out of town when the Jakes take down the Pharaoh
Reason, He was moving that peruvian white
blowing coolies into hoopties , slamming cuties and ice
big heavy pots over hot stoves
Mayonnaise jars of water with rocks in them got my whole projects out of order
A Kilo is a thousand grams
Beige, gold, brown, dirty, fluffy, tan, extract oil cut from cuban plants
The chemist is brolic, pyrex scholars
Professors at war over raw, killing partners for a million dollars
Chorus
Some say a drug dealers destiny is reachin the ki'
I'd rather be the man behind the door, supplying the streets
A hundred birds go out, looking like textbooks
when they wrapped and stuffed
four days later straight cash, two million bucks
strictly powder, no cut
your coke is vialed in, whats up?
Y'all beefin over little shit, we sniff, the balance split up
In a plane or a penthouse, office or a warehouse
Tony's got it nice, we never heard of any big droughts
A Kilo is a thousand grams
A pile of sand is equivilant, to the eye
It's nice to have a thousand fans
Coke buyers, some be liars
therefore, you check for wires
dedicated dealers, during holidays we give 'em lighters
Red tops, blue tops, green tops, yellow tops
Purple tops, beige tops, white tops, grey tops
Black tops, clear tops, gold tops, pink tops
Silver tops, tan tops, aqua tops, orange tops
Salt tops, long tops, short tops, 12 12's
58 58's, weed bags, ziplocks
Big rocks, coke spots, big glocks, one OT's
Crumbs chopped, hot pots, one plate, crack Spot
Chorus
Thirteen getting it, pyrex whipping it
Like UPS, pack it up, shipping it
Whether base or sniffing it, I got your fix
The story's foretold like apocalypse
It was me Michael T.T., handing out freebies
Taking over blocks, telling niggas to be fee
Where big brother 'Vine'll leave the body in the street
Something kinda like how I be bodying the beat
We was 300 deep like the Persian soldiers
Word spread fast, we was serving boulders
Ten crack commandments, holy Moses
If you don't fit must equip icer toners
Never grip they holders, fingers to the snitchers
The New York niggas be taking all our bitches
But we be God damned if taking all our business
Duct tape, hard tops, C.S.I. forensics
Chorus

Step foot on our block, there's no way possibly
Guns too big for you, to ever try stoppin' me
Talk out your mouth, you better speak properly
Aiyo, first of all, you ain't worth to brawl
And my fifth, call it the gift, when I curse you all
See I'm a soldier, look at my ranks
On the block, we got that water bubblin' like we cookin' up franks
This is Trife Diesel, get familiar with the name
I'm here, to stay for a while, so steel it in your brain
My guerrillas'll bang, we are the Planet of the Apes
Clips as long as bananas, throw them hammers in your face
From the land of the pushers, hustlers and handlers
With military, heavyweight standers
Cameras on the cannons, move amongst hoes and gamblers
Empties on my project balconies
My guns vow for me, my bitch count for me
I'm royalty, motherfucker gon' bow to me
20-04, vampires that'll rip off your neck
And eat your garlic, murder, from New York to Charlotte
It'll beat a nigga down like Sonny Carlton, when he ran through a gauntlet
Yo, my plate never pork, I sink deep into minds where you can't talk
Cough it up, bitch, I shine like Chinaware
Shine like the box in the live ball player amped
Fuck Mike Jordan, it's P-Tone in the air
Pullin' over NARCs with mad coke stashed in the spare
Guns and all that, the NARCs said, why you dipped in all black
Said, I'm comin' from a funeral, y'all boys can fall back
It's Wiganomics, I drop like a brick in the third
And y'all fruit cake niggaz think my style's absurd
Only the birds I blow back, Staten Island super gat
Talk is pork, I get that money then stupid stack

Chain around your neck, you better play your part
Cuz ain't a damn thing sweet, like the Wonka Factory

Oh, you know, you know
Yo, boo, let's cut the crap, you know we like each other
I been wanting you bad, yo, that's word to my mother
I know you got a man, and I'm involved
But we can play this right, if we shuffle the cards
I've been wanting you for mad years, when the elevators broke
I run and help you with your bags upstairs
I was scoping you out, today you was late, to leave by 8
With no time to be at work at 9
She'll be back by 6, son pissed you off, I know
When I spoke, yo, you didn't say shit
But still, you was looking mad cute to me
With your lips poked out, being rude to me
You're still sexy, luscious, and all them words
Only girl in the building with a full length fur
Had no choice to raise and press up, explain how I feel
It's only your love I want the best of
Chorus
I had a dream, yo, I seen you on the laundry mat
Folding your clothes by the dryer, my drawers is wet
So you passed me a Bounce, one fell when I bend down
And got up, you start tonguing me down
Butterflies ran across my stomach
Didn't wanna put the fire out, cuz God damn, I love it
Moved the basket out the way, cleared the table
Laid you down, my mouth slid past your navel
Your feet, had knocked over the Clorox bleach
Held my head closer to you when my tongue got deep
I'm saying we both of those, this how I feel
If you don't want a part of me, it's no big deal
But ma, I'm not here to game you, babe, I'm going on vibes
Somewhere inside, I know you feel the same
It's alright tho, you look like, you know how to get it
Here take my keys, come upstairs in a minute

Let's stop faking, let's just go get naked

Don't be surprised, when you see me 'round town
Walking around, with my head hung down
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
And don't be surprised, if you see me on the train
Like a homeless man, who's lost his way
I'm so lonely, I'm so lonely
On this cold pavement, I feel like laying
In the middle of the street, and just saying
I can't take it, I won't make it
Too much weight on my shoulders, and my kids are getting older
For so long, I've been so strong
I've been crying all week since you've been gone
And as the tears roll out my eyes
Another happy young couples walks by
Chorus
Someone been sleeping in my bed, eating my food
Using my soap, laying up in my pool
Walking around in his boxers, like every thing's cool
Gassing my chick for the whip, dropping her off at school
Under my covers and changing my channels
Playing my CD's in my robes, another man's burning my candles
My cologne's half way gone, a fake don, my wiz fell for
Now she strolls the park under his arm
This is my fault, I've never thought I'd see this coming
From the outside bugging, with crazy knots in my stomach
Say what goes around, comes around, now I know it now
Now I'm the fool looking in while it's going down
If somebody would of told me, I might be lonely
Now it's on me, baby call me please
Chorus
Now he's getting all my kisses, stroking my loving
That 'posed to be me, but I was too stupid and stubborn
Like a piece of rope, I let it go, my mother said it so
You better straighten up, don't act like you didn't know
Her birthday came, heard she was hugged up, wearing his chain
Play in the sky box, at some bullshit Knick game
My son said, daddy, he like his eggs well done
And he kinda cool, mommy happy, I can't front
He take us on trips and clothes shopping, most of the time
We watch flicks on your surround sound, he watch boxing
You better go beg or something, before she go love him
He's taking your spot, cuz you was dissing mommy, you bugging
They don't argue, he sent her flowers for no reason
She's cheesing, I'm wishing you could come back and see this

First I loved God, then loved my mother
Love my babies, sisters and brothers
Love my father cos that's my mom's partner
Love my grandmother and my grouchy assed grandfather
Love my aunties on both sides of the family
Uncles, cousins, nieces and nepthews
Mess with my peoples you get stepped to
Love the mother of my children, them girls is special
Love feels good though we stuck in the hood
Love my last album, though the joint went wood
My mans and my enemies, I Love them too
Love God he let me see passed 32
Plus what he gave Wu
I chance to change music just listen, you and I know the truth
Love is essential, to some it's detrimental
Most of you would've use the next person as a rental

Like every ghetto flower (oh Love yeah)
Cos Love, only Love has the heat and the power
And we can never give it up

Love life, the ground we walk on
My sickness, it made me strong
My loved ones in Heaven
The ones we lost, to heroin
Malcolm, Martin, and what they still for, the men had it poppin'
Love the sun when rain drops in, cosy night with mom punk in
Love the hell and my struggle
You gotta go through Hell to come out right, Love conquers pain and the puzzle
Funny on how Love could end so subtle
Was it just sex and not really Love for the couple?
Love people, Love the fact when there's a baby bein' born
Like ""push girl, come on""
I'm not just sayin' that cos BET's on
We is one, one Love, each one, teach one

Just like a fresh pair of Royals on the first day of school
It was love, even from the jump I spoiled you
Before the fame camera cars and the glitter
Though my occupation is tasty for God's sake it came with the bitches
But that's on another note (uh-huh) let me explain here
right now sugar on how I feel for you
Like when we UHH yo I get these crazy chills from you
And when we done, yo I know the perfect meal for you
The mashed joints, big onions on sauteed fish
Little Royal, candle and one big kiss
You my pumpkin and my 'nilla custard; you cussed me out
when you found condoms layin in my pocket I was busted
I gets right witchu (uh) form a life with you (yeah)
The type after sex get a warm rag and then wipe you
Hyped up love light it up, might bite you at the altar
I'm bitin off you, I'm wearin white too
[Ruff Endz]
Ain't it funny how tables turn, chase you all around
Change your life baby, cause I love you baby

Stuck with me through the thick and thin
Through the pain and strife.. the love of my life
Said that it will ne-ver last
But I'm here by your side.. the love of my life
[Ghostface]
And I'm here.. that's my word
Only fight you when we makin love, that's what I call it
Burnin the chronic we laughin while I'm shittin on the toilet
Camcord it, happy times record it; the time you asked me
for them blue Nike's - I was like, ""Boo I can't afford it""
I was fucked up, plus I was stuck, Starks the King
Hit the block and still scraped up, eighty beans
How you like them apples? My technique is Taye Diggs
Your attitude is right that's why I made you my Wiz
The only girl that can make my shit jump, with the slightest touch
You at the stove while I'm grabbin my stuff
God forbid somethin happen to us
Let's remain and friends and discuss our troubles and might try again
Word to my Iron pen, it's not good to hold the cryin in
I feel the same way your heart's trapped in the lion's den
Iron Man, I am him
It's the beauty in our souls through Allah where the love lies within
[Ruff Endz: repeat 2X]
Can't believe you found love in me, through everything
Held me down like my boys in the streets, here's the ring
Whatchu wanna do? Whatchu wanna do?

Every part of me, every thing I've done
is still there, still there, still care, ohhh

Where do I begin
To tell you all the things I feel when you're with me?
The day we met I knew I'd fall so easily
You must believe you're givin' everything I need
Never to much..
Snatched the Princess
Tricks keep searchin for the glass slipper
The first time the brides maid zipped the zipper
Then walked down the aisle, look at little pretty Roxanne's smile
That's right, she big head child
Spot the glass on the hand, white valor laying across the floor
Draggin' damn, she got a good man
Family in the back, one half on both sides of the church
Look at Keisha in the tight ass skirt
Mom Duke in the front row, Grandma Pearl sittin right next our row
Beside Uncle Joe, then right before her eyes
The preacher ask, ""Would it to death do you part if one dies?""
She replies, ""Yes"", the winnin words that described best
Grandma pinned sittin 30 on the right breast
Now she searchin for the slob-down, the block's slick vitamin joint
Mad water in her eyes at this point
The man holdin the Bible announces, ""You're married for life
Sign my cheque, peace to the bridal""
Recall this one girl's marriage, one girl's carriage
One with the lucky fingers, grab it, she attracted to magnet
She might have cracked the safe, seen the cabbage
Now it's one love in the tablet
Chorus
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay
Cobra popped, a bottle of black Burgundy, coversated
I stared at your green eyes stagnated, your butter milk skin
You smelled good but you taste even better
Eye ball walk/talk was first on the agenda
I 'member the first time we engaged in the act, in the ac'
You jumped on my lap and pushed the seat back
Passionate thoughts, I knew you would be the wiz
Now you hold my kids, my divine little wiggs
The grand souflan cuz of your presence
So I'ma take it back to the essence just like Valentine presents
Long tongues and wet kisses, sex positions
Buy habista, siesta key, Florida visits
You exquisite young heart, I held you by afar, unchained
Our physical's 33 within the Range
Things have changed over the course of time
But you are mine, and I'm yours
I'm lookin forward to you after tours
Chorus
How do I begin
To show you I love you anywhere, it ain't no sin?
This love will outlast time, I can't remember when
I thought I lost you but now that you're in my arms
Just say you'll stay

Lalalalala, whoa, whoa, whoa

I'm like Malcolm out the window with the joint
Hoodied up blood in my eye ,
a lead to fly
Like fuck it [2 gunshots] , look how these niggas duck shit
One kid hollerin what lookin up , he the big wig
Fake ass cat , low life , sodomize mind
Beatin niggas , big bricks of bread sellin mad dimes
His feet hurt , networkin he get no work
Yo smack him where his hand hurt , fuck what he worth
Yo he sucked his thumb smooth for the kid laced with the big guns
Stain to my Baltimore niggas that he on the run
Plus he ill in the drums , heartburn for life , calcium man
Watch him grab the Tums , he's a front
Pigeon totalist sister with the fat ass
Show hash behind up the block plus he smashed her
Big Bub did him somethin deadly , act premedidtated
Buck 60 strike was the medley
Nice like Van Halen , seen him at the tunnel with his skin peelin
Did two days thought he was jailin
You get close , look at his hands
That's the same kid that cut his wrists , talkin bout the cuffs did it
He ran away , frontin majorly , eyes like Sammy Davis jr.
Rounded off with a fade g , he sport the Bob Hope classics
Ran down Asics , Kmart , the short sleeve shit be the basics
He eat hams shitted on himself twice , big hatted Jews
Rushed the nigga out in Crown Heights
[CHORUS:]
Yo let me tell you how the game go
We gettin rid of all the prostitutes
Tony wants the streets back fo sho
Too many hustlers , too many thieves
We're fuckin up who's willin to fight and teach the c's
Too much TV , guns and robberies
Lust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy
[Ghostface]
Yo I champunch Mase in his face over some bullshit
The other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives
It's rainin , 85 degrees kinda muggy
One of the nights they thrown in his face it's real ugly
Yo we up in Jonesy's posin , all these niggas know me
From fuckin wit , under theses niggas heavy parolees
Yo we played the speaker
And from a distance we could see these chains
The P slayed , flat on his chest , was two plains
Ashy hands yo , no need for rings at all
He just cracked the V8 backed up , leaned against the wall
Lookin flower , he just came home , he on like a fuck
Did a dime for holdin up the gods up in the armored truck
Ten years later son 280 on the weight tip
He throwin up six plates plus he studied Matrix
He's a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor
Cock-eyed nigga back up his neck he had shores
Sammy eagerly rode up on him , taxi off the turkey with the joint
On him
Flower look his man stood up before him
The bitches hit the table , Jah king stripped off his cables
Shots went off , Sam'll get a chance to make his debut
Flower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns , hat fell off
We nerd his wigworms , he hid behind Rich
See Allah hit the light switch , young girls were trampled
In the measured pool , pistol with Mase , and broke the handle
Desperate crawlin to the door on all fours
Shim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was ""It's Yours""
Oh my goodness , Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin
He layin like a gay models shoutin out Sebastian
He smiled with his teeth missin begging for mercy
No more god , the 68 thousand down a pair of three
Out came the cannon , whistled out zaggin
Cham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon
It's over , another story told
Lyin with the snakes , tongue kissin cobras

deep inside your core, the explosion stops the menstration
Causes stomach inflation
Patiently waiting nine months for deportation
Of the Earth from the Moon, black woman stay in tune
Yo God, let me pour y'all the science about the womb

Fertile soil before you are wise
And spoiled many men and took many lives
And all you brothers changed sides

I don't wanna talk to you holmes, I don't communicate
My guns they in my hand, one in my palm
And I could dial your number, like a smile off the face
With the H.K. 9, I'm the all black hummer
Metal lungies'll spit the grungiest shit
Hungriest shit, seventeen dummies a clip
Tell them rap niggaz to suck my dick, fuck the industry
And shift, shut down the store, bust my shit
I got some hustlin' ass niggaz that'll pump my bricks
And some dust head niggaz that'll dump my clips, what?

-My God, so they are killers.
I've heard lots of people say once a man's a killer, they just keep
on killing and killing; they sort of develop a taste for blood.
-Yeah, that's right. They kill one man, or kill ten,
it's all the same (yes). After all, (indecipherable)
[VERSE 1:]
Both hands clusty, chillin' wit my man Rusty low down
Blew off the burner kinda dusty
The world can't touch Ghost, purple tape Rae co-host
Monty Hall expo, intellect you red pro
Son triflin fuck, wildflower on the cyclin
Pick up the brew thought I was Michael an'
Mics are writin' pool, now, I'm into Iron Duals
Turn-ons the Earth's whoopee, she out of law school
In hale break beats of hell A-Alikes propel parallel
Duracell night, you flash a burnt cell
Snap out of CandyLand, kids the old rumor is
blacks become immune to shit, we never did like
eati' dead birds chose the pharmacy over herbs
Men marryin men, ill they got the herbs pulsar
Scissor hand wig vanished in the winter
Livin' off land you god damn right I fuck fans king me
Check checkmate props like the micro chip founder
Neck to neck stocks with Bill Gates now
[CHORUS:]
When we hug these mics we get busy
Come and have a good time with G-O-D
Make you snap your fingers or wiggle
Scream, shout, laugh and just giggle
Shake that body, party that body
Don't fuck with Ghost you'll feel sorry
That's word, I'm not the herb
Understand what I'm sayin' [echo]
[VERSE 2:]
Hit mics like Ted Koppel, rifle expert
Let off the Eiffel, burn a flag in the grass it's spiteful
Ringleader set it off, rap Derek Jeter
Culprit, prince of the game wish you could see us
We lay low glitter wax full bangles
Priceless rolls, lay around the God get tangled
Woolly hair, eyes firey red, feet made of brass
Twelve men, following me, it be the God staff
Move, every script's like Miramax
Smash the big boy totalled it, will shot fear effects
Son beamin' wifee on the beach, sippin' Zima
Wu 'binos, to latinos, we bust Selena
Over night, God schedules, fed ex
Pretty soloette velvet nice DNA scroll genetics
Too hot, to handle one thought scramblin the mandolin
Hundred game Wilt Chamberlain, smack em, say when
He rollin up, face wrinkled up, hands is on his nuts
Yo kid stop frontin' on the ground before you get touched
It's Canada Dry sess, obsessed with Allah's sun
We want rye, we want it so bad we might cry
-What we do, depends on breath control, so it's the first thing you must
learn. Fortunately it's easy. You'll soon learn.
- My God so they are killers
- Killing and killing, they sort of develop a taste for blood

[Trife Da God:]
Uh, thirty thousand feet up in the air, up in the lear
Dressed in a black tux, forty cal. tucked, strapped to the chair
Half asleep, hopping out of my seat, caught in the daze
Turned around and seen a white man's face, covered in shades
I must of passed out, can't remember shit before I blacked out
Three more niggas approaching, holding they mack's out
One spoke, gave me the keys, to a boat
Reached in his trenchcoat, and pulled out a yellow envelope
Which contained twenty thousand in cash, a photograph
Of a Colombian nigga with a long mustache
Miguel Sanchez, keep a gun hidden in his pants leg
With armed bodyguards, surveillance around his land spread
He runs a billion dollar organization, under investigation
Plus he's wanted by immigration
Now I'm stuck, crazy look on my face, shocked in amazement
How the fuck I get involved with these federal agents
They knew my background, knew about what happened down in Sac Town
They knew about the wrap down south, they laid they backs down
Said I had two decisions, take out Miguel and his cartel
Or spend the rest of my life in prison
A classified mission on some James Bond shit
007 style, love to get some straight convicts
Now I'm pondering, my thoughts wandering, got my girl on the phone
Told her to kiss little Jay cuz I'll be gone again
Honey, I can't sleep, she sucking her teeth
If everything go good, baby, I'll be home in a week
Pinching myself just to see if I'm dreaming, call up my team and
Meet me by the docks in Miami, I'll fly out this weekend
[Sun God:]
I got you nigga, four-four pop two niggas
That drug lord that we want, got a spot for niggas
And if we kill 'em, it's back to the block, my nigga
He carried rugers, thirty four shots I figure
He only holla at the kid, when there's money involved
They pack shotguns, hollow tips, dummies and all
When me and Trife doing right together, got no choice
But give us ten, like we selling white together
Left side, four-five, right, black beretta
Taking trips over seas, flipping packs for better
Every flight a hundred stacks and better, so grind hard
Get ya money up, get on your grillies, don't mind odds
Fuck a cop car, throw on some chumpers, and drop charge
Hit the block hard, it's kinda hard being G-O-D
If he owe Trife, he owe me
Load up the mack grounds, M-I-A, call that the jack town
Tell niggas I'm on my way, coming back down
Miguel, Mr. Sanchez, it's a wrap, now
Theodore extorting your shit, handing out packs, now
I used to listen to 50 and jam ""Back Down""
Now I slang fifty kilo's where I'm at now
Fifty a wop, purple top, nigga, I'm back, clown
Crystal bottles, Grey Goose for the chat lounge
Channel seven news, older dude, murder gat found

The wiley Wu-Tang comes back, Iron Man strikes back
(Lou Diamonds, Tony Starks) Raid your whole empire
No doubt!
[Verse One: Raekwon the Chef, AKA Lou Diamonds]
Rich man, poor man, read the headlines
Nigga getting murdered for spot and bigger dimes
Jobs and drug wars
Living by gun law
Jailcats come home and want to take yours
As the young one, growing up broke me and my people
as the self, huh, I guess we all in the same boat
Think it, plus drinkin that 90-proof
Playin' on the roof sayin'
we need a next man to shoot...
(Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child...)
[Verse Two: Ghostface Killer, AKA Tony Starks]
Yo, I know a rich kid, who got hit for three bricks
Showin off his 850 plus, what a nice whip
Young blood guzzlin' fourties hussled in a rain
Old Earth, shootin' dope in her veins
He never had it all, the kid loved basketball
Had a favorite song, ""I Miss You"" written by Aaron Hall
Now back to the original, neighborhood, criminals
Clocking dollars, by the hour like his digital
Styrofoam silencers, he rolled around with the
Wildest niggaz peeling caps known as the Islanders
from Staten, where crazy clips be clappin
Slept in his principal spreads, threads, made of satin
Labeled as the cow he had crazy beef
Seen him at the flicks, he pulled out on Duke, Hez and Latief
But he fucked up, he shoulda kept it real and went for kill
cuz if he don't, these niggaz with black barrels will
But, shit will never calm down, one day downtown
He dropped an ounce off
Money had slept like a nightgown
He rolled up in the Albee Square, relax like he lived in there
Two kids was beamin him, them niggaz from the movie theatre
One had all Guess on, lookin like he had a vest on
The other felly pell tucked with a firearm
Movin slow, baseball hats, crazy down low
Word life God, this bull kag nigga gotta go
Oh shit! Bookhead, just bought a 5, G headed King Tudpea
About the size of Little Maurice
We got to get up baby, no cousin, count to ten
I'm runnin in my first instance, is to return em the time is now
Warfare and pull delf
Remember me, the nigga from the UA and you pulled out
Don't move don't even flinch
Fix em up, drop the head, don't want to get blood in the tux
He burped, I shot him, bitch screamed out I'm robbin him
Had to hit him ten more times make sure I got him
Told the owner lay on the floor, shake the comedy
Randy came out wacked out with a half a shotty
I laughed, grab the King Tud head and the cash
Then he shot my man in the ass and broke mega glass
Damn, had to go out with a blast
I shot my way up out of the Albee fast
(Sometimes I feel, like a motherless child)
Oh shit, what the fuck?
This shit is horrible.

Shareefa... oh
From the blocking, to the dropping
I need a girl that's stacking and popping
When I come in late, she's not clocking
Not in the crib, throwing 'round pots and
Nice girl, that's clean, that was raised to cook
Be on the couch chilling, shorts on, reading a book
Biting on a pen, thin glasses on
French type frames by Yves Saint Laurent
Say hey pretty mama, do you fit the bill
Do you got what it take for you to fit in my wheel?
Would you bust that steel if, niggas came to kill me
Protect that safe, baby, dag, that's filthy
Whoa, somebody let her know up in here
He like Papa Smurf, I'm like Papa Bear
I'm just looking for a queen, so I can rock her ear
Tell her P. Tone in here, I got her locked this year
Chorus
I'm not your average girl
I be your Bonnie right beside you
No need to worry, boo, I got you, yeah
I'm not your average girl
See me without you is unlikely
Them other bitches they night like me, oh, wow
You can have keys to the boat, money follow me
I got the cheese and the yolk, plus the juice
That's fresh squeeze with the pulp, mama got a big butt
Tiffany chain, the stones freeze in the throat
Love to hold my hand, stepping off planes from D.R.
Luggage with a big black tan
Whatcha gonna do? You or him, me or you?
Fucking with him, you look mad pitiful
Boo, I'm not the type that be slobbing down hoochies
Looking at these hoes, eyes low like Droopy
Tugging on my jacket til the lights come on
We run trains on them bitches, never ice they arm
That's a no-no, chicken heads looking for a come up
In the club, 'oh my God', now they wanna run up
Nagging til the sun up, shut up, I'm not a double-up, boo
Go get your feet done, your toes, cuz they knuckles up
Chorus
Baby, baby, don't waste your towel
Looking any further cuz the girl is ours
Holds it down for you, any place, any time
You already know, I'm the one, yeah, I'm that
Fly girl, rider, just say the word
Anything pop off, it's us against the world
Such a hood girl, with that dirty loving that'll make your toes curl
Yo, relax and chill, analyze the story
Love, your boy Tone got mass appeal
All them other little players ain't as half as real
They just wanna get up in you like Mass & Gill
But me, I need a wisdom, play it like wifey
Well mannered, understand the kid and not bite me
All my real ladies, put your hands up
Holla at your boy, if you ain't a groupie, right now, stand up

This is Ghostface, straight from Staten Island
You know.. I don't really mean no harm..
but it just happens you know
when I step approach a motherfuckin wack nigga..
that tryin to spit his darts and can't spit 'em
Check it out though.. aiyyo..
Scientific, my hand kissed it
Robotic let's think optimistic
You probably missed it, watch me dolly dick it
Scotty watty cop it to me, big microphone hippie
Hit Poughkepsie crispy chicken verbs throw up a stone richie
Chop the O, sprinkle a lil' snow inside a Optimo
Swing the John McEnroe, rap rock'n'roll
Tidy Bowl, gung-ho pro, Starsky with the gumsole
Hit the rump slow, parole kids, live Rapunzel
but Ton' stizzy really high, the vivid laser eye guide
Jump in the Harley ride, Clarks I freak a lemon pie
I'm bout it, bout it - Lord forgive me, Ms. Sally shouted
Tracey got shot in the face, my house was overcrowded
You fake cats done heard it first
On how I shitted on your turf
at times, Cuban Link verse yo
Check out the rap kingpin, summertime fine jewelry drippin
Face in the box, I seen your ear twitchin
As soon as I drove off, Cap' came to me with three sawed-offs
Give one to Rae', let's season they broth
Lightning rod fever heaters, knock-kneeder Sheeba for hiva
Diva got rocked from the receiver bleeder
Portfolio, lookin fancy in the pantry
My man got bigger dimes son, your shit is scampi
Base that, throw what's in your mouth, don't waste that
See Ghost lampin in the throne with King Tut hat
Straight off

Universal death threats, yeah
This be the God Body, yeah no doubt

Rock those, big boy Bulotti's out of Woodridge
Porch for the biggest beer, season giraffe ribs
Rotissiere ropes, hickory scented mint scented glaze
Perfected find truth within self, let's smoke
All hail to my hands, 50 thou' appraisal
Dirty nose with the nasal drip, click flipped on fam
Dancin with Blanch and them bitches, flickin goose pictures
Kick down the ace of spades, snatch Jack riches
Olsive compulsive lies flies with my name on it
Dick made the cover now count, how many veins on it
Scooby snack jurassic plastic gas booby trap
Ten years workin for me, you wanna tap shit?
Bung bung bung! Your bell went rung rung rung!
Staple-Land's where the ambulance don't come
Yeah, you see what I mean?
You see what I mean, you motherfuckin crybabies?
Get in line punk! You should be studyin your odds
instead of studyin me!
That's how you lost your first job punk
Now get in line, for you get your lil' thick-ass tossed up!
Shit! I studied under Bruce Lee nigga
He was on the fourth, I was on the third
[RZA]
Pass me a honey-dipped spliff, black mental cause continental drift
One whiff of Pow U gets my Divine stiff
Brick rock, late night, hear the tick tock of my clock
I used to run up and pick, a crab lock
Hit his stash, dip back, to the Lab, make him flip
Uptown, BOO-DOOP, now we back on your ass
Incognito, fatal aikido blow, pop a needle
Dick a knock-knee hoe, bust out her fetal
Nine inch long strong, Bobby pop the bitch thongs
Spit on her, then I banged on my chest like Kong King
Merciless Meng, point the killa bee sting
ring DINGS, right through your head BING
Snap the wing off of bats, my battleaxe tongue hacks tracks
Once the ball drop, I'ma snatch ten jacks
Pass the crack to a niggarette, puff a looseleaf cigarette
while your man search the internet for +Bob Digitech in Stereo+
Crazy as Shapiro
Multiply myself ten times standin next to zero
And snap my fingers like the Fonz
and bag me a golden bronze skinned girl with the honey blonde
dip hair, make a nigga flip in his chair
Had the armpit shaved off perfect with the Nair
Stomach fat as a pancake for her man's sake
Used to fuck her when she menestraute
but it made her hyperventilate

She's happy, her hair, toes and nails is dumb right
The smell of her fragrance, baffled my nostrils
I can see through her eyes, she's feeding on in the possible
She blushes, as I kept splashing her compliments
Polite thank yous, is all around, she crush the mints
Developments, smooth keys from the piano
Changed the mood, like we changed the channel
This is art, Picasso, I got him beat in the flesh
I'm staring at beauty, Nefertiti, heaven bone in the chest
Yes, everywhere she step, went off like a flare gun
Stilettos on, parquet floors
Miss thing, she's a fierce one, two and three
Bad little mama, she built like Alicia Keys
No facade, her strut is hard, based on books by
Intelligent jail crooks, writing to let the time fly
She dropped the bracelet, I kneeled down
Prestigious gentleman, with my right hand, I picked it up
I stood up, to the cutest eyelashes, as I gave her, her jewels back
Miss thing started rubbing her gut
Excuse me, are you pregnant? Not to be rude
But if it means anything, I can get you some food
Cheese crackers, in the back there's sauteed shrimp
(Nah, I never free lumps, I'll be as big as a blimp
See my due date is January, my first, and it's kinda scary
It's only June, and Christmas, I'll be getting married
And I'm happy, excuse me, what's your name?)
Tone Starks (Peace, I'm Gabby, well I gotta go, my husband is waiting)
But before I go, can I give you one last statement
You the most beautifullest queen, I ever seen
And I would love to have a thing like you, on my team, you take care
Chorus
Any other day, I would of just let you, pass me by
Cuz I see you got situations
And I've got mine, but baby its OK
It's alright, I'm not gonna let you pass me by
Cuz this was love at first sight
Cuz this was love at first sight
It's OK
You can tell he must be on a mission
Because my heart has made it's decision
As soon as you stepped in my peripheral vision
I fell in love, sweet love
And no infatuated 3D glasses to see
That your the one I need
And the situation don't matter to me
Cuz this is love, it gotta be love
Love at first sight

Studied Scarface, so I knew what the plan was
To get that CREAM, and serve them fiends

Two way team, posted up on the benches
Wit a magnet for a stash, that I kept hid under the black fences
Jakes shootin' through the middle, like Kerry Kittles
I was baggin' up small hittin' fiends, with very little
Though they switched nickels on niggas, and pointed out bitches
In the precinct got the snitchin', so they hit 'em off with something decent
Avoid the sweeping, them boys is beastin'
On point, but I'm kinda paranoid when they creepin'
Faggot ass niggas, when I ride get the fuck out the way
When I see jewels, all I know is take
I'm like a seed at a birthday party, all I want is cake

Wake ya bitch up, watch the fifth pick up!

This is why the World Series of Poker
Is decided over a no limit poker tournament
Players, pro's even, can't handle the pressure of the game
They consider no limit the only pure game left
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
We gotta know how to play your cards, have a mean poker face
And know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
This is no limit hold 'em, you gotta know when to fold 'em
If you plan on, staying on top
You can't lose, what you don't push into the pot
You can't make much either, if you a believer of luck
Go all in, if you're feeling your cards, deep in your gut
[Shawn Wigs:]
It was a late Saturday night, big chips, we had a lotta
Theodore performed at the Plush Brigatta
It was an hour in, big chip leader of the game
Caught pocket jacks and flopped two more of the same
Looking at quads, waiting for someone to bluff
So I checked til someone said ""I had enough""
I'm raising a thousand, son I pay to see the river
Caught an ace and his face, was a straight up giver
He had three now, must of caught two in the hole
A full boat, I'm about to sink ship, tell him to fold
He laughs, raises his fifty g's, please I need chip count
The pit boss, swear I flip over, you gon' flip out
I'm all in, here to win, I rep Staten Island
He called it, I showed four jacks, he started wilding
[Interlude: ?]
This son of bitch..
All night, he set me up, he check, check, he trapped me!

It was a cash game, 100/200 dollar table
Me and Johnny Mack sitting, God willing and able
July 23rd and 4th, the lions is out
It's the month of the Leo, we gon' win with no doubt
Bunch of high rollers, laughing like he know we're low in the amateurs
I buy him for the macks, twenty G's, I'mma damage ya
Couple of chuckles, broken glasses, all tinted
I'mma put ya'll all on tilt, give me a minute
So I check raise 'em, bluff 'em, ain't showing my cards
Two four off two, ya'll ain't no superstars
I should of been at the table, World Series of Poker
I'm up 80 G's already, ya'll a bunch of jokers
Now they all on tilt, raising, I call 'em all in
With pocket three's, for 80 G's, I'm ready to fall in
Flop two aces, caught my three on fourth street

Take it out, turn around
Charlie horse, shit, threw me off balance
Wildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent
To let you know on how I rep in Staten Island
This is the reason I came to you
So we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do
Cuz we don't need no representation
Domination, got them waitin' patient
[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Now this is the way ya'll suppose to
To get dowwnnnnnnnn, ya'll ain't right
Somebody say ""Aha! Ghost is back!""
[Missy Elliott]
Pull back the curtain, let me work your sermon
Playboy don't hurt me like a virgin
You seem real determined to put a hurtin'
But if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin'
You got a lot of nerve, to wanna serve my curves
My 36D, 36 hips
The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles
And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips
Eh, I really like you baby
Do you know how to wife this lady?
Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch
Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush
Now shush... in my bush
And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh
Just throw it, I'll show you how to push
Kinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist
Come on..
[Chorus]
[Outro: Missy Elliott]
Come on... hah... oh..
Come on... hah... oh... aha-ha
Oh... aha-ha... whoo!
Come on!

Pour the glass of Crut, tap the bottle then toast
Barrie took a sip for the cause, yeah my son
Soon to be 3, tried to fill his bottle then run
Then I got a collect call, heard niggaz down the block is fightin
Some nigga got, knifed up brawlin
Heard the kid was 19, Lil' Infinity too
His father worked up at the dealer he loved boo
They tried him for his Louis', son wasn't havin it though
Yeah, yeah my nigga, the color of glue
Decided on a intervene, guess who tried to wild on me my nigga
This is like out of the blue
I'm in the Range stretch, jumped out, tucked the chain
Proceded to talk to him, then you heard the heavy face slap
Think I broke my wrist, now I'm at the hospital vexed
Fucked up my writing hand, that's my check
Now I wanna kill this lil' nigga true
Only thing that stop my gun flamin cause he related to you
[Ghostface]
Who? He ain't related to me
Just that I knew him for like 18 years until he violated, stealin my gear
If my lil' homey, yo he eat anything for me
Send him uptown, he get bagged, yo he never call me
Come home and still blow cats for me
Pump crack, stabbin all them hoodrat shorties
A live gunslinger well known, born to dance
When the heat is on, Stapleton days, shoot hisself in the groin
The gun went off, it looked like a flick
When he fell to the floor, holdin his nuts, screamin ""God damnit
Shit I put one in my balls, what the fuck y'all lookin at me for?
Call the police, do somethin
Motherfuckers standin around, watch when I get better
All hell's gonna be terror
Death to you, you,"" he pointed at Red
I said chill that's fam duke
He put real work in that make you cute, fuck that
But anyway son indeed, he stole two Polo rugbies
Swore to his dead mother, I couldn't take it
Yo Lord I knocked out his teeth
Now he's rockin those false joints like everything's peace

Niggaz couldn't take the chain, it's too heavy
Word to mother, I was swingin that Shaolin Style machete
Now when I come through it's ""What up Ghost?"", my folks throwin confetti
My gear is the world premiere, ox yeah, now I'm dickin down Heather Locklear
Rubber glock in the glove box, Benz drop yeah
Hit the mall in Long Island, they got hens out there
I'm not a sex symbol, gangsta or activist
I just bubble like acid in a glass of Cris'
My pen's is Illmatic, plush robes drag across the floor
Gun hand is sore from choppin the raw
And when the jet land smoked up just look right under ya
The aircraft carry back half of Colombia
Yeah, separate the rubble
Stay beatin niggaz brains out with the God broke belt buckle

My bird blew niggaz away like a clarinet

And I still walk down the aisle with a plastic Tec

Uh, that's what I'm talking bout nigga
That's some real words right there
So you know, we just gon' keep this shit rolling
Theodore, they know how we do it
Straight up and down, introducing
One fourth of the squad, Wiganomics

Yo son I smack bitches, make 'em say ""Yes, Wiggatry""
Smoke out ya room like I'm cookin up hickory
Dickory dock, my glock tucked by the scrotum

Cuz the Pips be stinky like Pepi LePew
And my style's so sick, son, they call it the flu
Influenza, top contender
Had ya girl head-noddin leavin marks on my Swollen Member
I remember them days when the Stat was my home
Now we hop state to state, flyin in and out of zones
Had to put down the heat, picked up the microphone
Started payin off the jewelers and flossin in stones
Chunky and I ain't talkin chicken noodle soup
Got a V for Vendetta this year and need to recoup
That two point five million'll slice a Sicillian
Next year we want the whole fuckin pie we makin a killin
Uh, that's right nigga
'06, bout to take us into '07
The years is ours, from here on out
Theodore, straight up and down
Word up, introducing next
You know, acknowledge the great
My muthafuckin' man J-Love
Aiyo, I come through like a Chicago Bears linebacker
Call me Brian Urlacher, straight up attack you
Then I backslap you, yeah, ya niggas get flipped
Son, I've never been a punk faggot ass idiot
Get snatched in all letters, Puerto Rican bitch fetish
Call me the streets, or the mixtape terrorist
I get respected, like a Pride Fighter champion
Out in Japan, I was ready to smash one
It's real, son, I hold down my squadron
Ghostface and Life scared Madison Square Garden
Is the next destination hip hop preservation?
Theodore Unit on an ill ass invasion
Kid Crooklyn style, Premo production
The greatest men walking, fuck all them their assumptions
Yo, call me the king, the presence of greatness
Often imitated, but you can't duplicate this
Haha, no, next up, the man who needs no introduction
Muthafuckin' New York's Backbone, take it home
Aiyo, I roll like a bat out of hell, something swell
With the money green Balley's and the chunky gazelle's
I'm an explorer like Dora, nigga, check out my aura
On the block, I assist quarters, but I'm really a scorer
Place your order, place your bets, I'll erase your set
Puncture your lung and inflate your chest
I keep killas on mountain tops, plotting on housing cops
While I'm in the spot, bagging up rocks, I'm counting knots
I got the eye of an eagle, ride for my people
These bars of life dope, and I supply you that diesel
I'm a needle in the haystack, laid back in Maybach
Slay phat, cuz he spray gats, try to escape that
Gray slacks for, all my Compton killas
Casket fillers, armed gorillas, who bomb for skrilla
Staten Island's most wanted, the backbone of the city
The rapper killings, niggas get slapped silly, you feel me?

Pss.. yo, yo, yo (yo son roll!)
Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
So I, stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G
Run, I will not give up, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to.. Ghost here they come now!
Errr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the Rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Fuck a case, I'm not comin' home when I'm fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cock suckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like bird tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got guns! Muthafucka..

Ah-hah! I might gotta take my shirt off (yeah, kid...)
I like that one (uh-huh, go in, go in!)
[Jadakiss]
Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got fine hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggaz throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' un-bagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
But I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm asthmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do
[Chorus]
[Interlude: Comp]
Yeah... yes! Yes!
Comp, Chocolate City! (Whoo!)
[Comp]
They got me runnin' and I weigh about three hundred
Drawers stuck in my ass, gun under my stomach
And I don't even know why they chasin' me for
Cuz I'm dirty like the corner in the bathroom floor
So I run through the alley, when I come through the block
Runnin' so fast, you would think I'm chasin' the cops
Right in broad daylight, in the middle of winter
I can't go to jail, my mother cookin' chicken for dinner, damn!
The Board of the City, Police Department
Try'nna put me in that bunk bed caged apartment
But I won't let 'em, you gon' have to catch him
All I heard was ""Freeze!"" and ""God damn it! Get him!""
I duck and dodge, I sprint and flee
They got canines and I don't need that sent on me
Body on the burner, I don't need that pit on me
But I'll be damned if a cop Rodney King me, Comp!

Saturday night, Uptown
Ridin past Kansas Fried Chicken
What's poppin kid?
We in the mix
It's chilly 40 below
Gate's closed gotta catch Dr. J's
Blowin my hand, rub on my nose
Tap the glass, stop frontin Duke, fresh pair of jeans
Look I got loot, eleven in the Bass boots
Heard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me 5 pictures
One had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs
You asked the wrong guy son
I'm from Melina, yeah we know Mr. Coles
Flew in two days ago to see his fam'
But we been watchin you, crazily
The whole Staten Island shittin on you
Wisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley
Hold up snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not trunk today, still lookin fly, still slammed up hung
Your mom pop in your trunk, slow your pace
Starks fixed your face, copped out the 6, five years probat'
You dealin with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watchin you
Make me wanna lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwin me down, grab my gun
Go 'head bust me, heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray
It's not mine fucker, what I said
You met the 13th nigga
A multimillion dollar operation is based upon it yo
Where in the Hell's the RZA?
He's sellin mics, wildest joints
Special made to go up in your hand and which went out on point
Switched to the next scene, I'm at the crib buggin out
on how po' live, hatin plus harassin the kid
Park the truck in the double face garage
Dial 1-900-Raekwon, tell the God shit's mega
Reel flashin me on BET, Planet Groove, Rap City News

Her name was Kim, this light skinned girl from Shaolin
Stood by my side when my world was caved in
She cooked for me, fix me up, plus made me happy
Every time she told me she loved me, I said ""no"" back
Since I was fucked up in the game, migranes
No honey in pockets, all I had was the change
Fourty-five feelings, they got the beef
I through the heat to my dome
She said ""If you shoot, you ain't the real Pretty Tone""
Baby, come home, you not alone, be strong whether right or wrong
Our bond is even more stronger when the night is gone
Say, ""Yo, Starks relax, you know I got the hot water runnin
Baby, oiled down, pots in the oven""
And my lovin'? It's gone when they style old fashion
And, a, don't worry bout that jam, you gonna smash 'em
Whose asking, your still has come
Stay focused, keep it cool, you know I love you
Love you too, babe, thank you

As if to say, them other chicks wasn't meant
When she came through, by every square inch possible
Help the kid get on out, every obstacle
Long talks at night, arguments and still try'nna solve
Whether who is right, we mad tight
And the way she, never call the cops on a nigga
Got me, open, even more on her with her bangin' body
My favorite sweetheart, cum, but don't ever stop
Your love, give me every drop, you kiss get's me very hot
Never felt feelings before, and felt so sure
Every time you put it on me, I fiend for more
Think that's the reason why, can't leave, can't lie
Look you dead in the eye
Word to fuck up, like Ralph, baby, your the greatest
I'mma sell my guns, and with the cash I'mma bring you to Vegas

Though they fuck up, and you still let them back in
Make some noise if you cook and you clean for 'em
Out of love, doing juks for them
To all my ladies who love a girl with good brains on 'em
Baggin' to get your name tattoed on 'em

Y'nah mean? It's real motherfuckin' shit, you know
Yo, making moves back and forth uptown
60 dollars plus toll is the cab fee
Wintertime bubble goose, goose, clouds of smoke
Music blastin' and the Arab V blunted
Whip smelling like fish from 125th
Throwin' ketchup on my fries, hitting baseball spliffs
Back seat with my leg all stiff
Push the fuckin' seat up, tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks
Rocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips
I'm ready for war, got to call the Cuban guys
Got the Montana pulled in front of the store
Made my usual gun check, safety off, come on Frank
The moment is here, take your fuckin' hood off and tell the driver to stay put
Fuck them niggaz on the block they shook, most of them won't look
They frontin', they no crooks and fuck up they own juks
Look out for Jackson 5-0 cause they on foot
Straight ahead is the doorway, see that lady that lady with the shopping cart
She keep a shottie cocked in the hallway
Damn she look pretty old Ghost, she work for Kevin, she 'bout seventy seven
She paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding
Flew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in
3 o'clock, watch the kids, third floor, last door
You look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you
Why? Why you behind me leery?
Shakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you
You is a crazy motherfucker, small Hoodie dude
Hilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit
Straight parry shit, Krispy Kreme, cocaine, dead bodies, jail time you gon' carry it
Matter of fact, all the cash, I'm a carry it
Stash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott
This is the spot, yo son your burner cocked?
These fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son
Passin' they rum, fried plantains and rice
Big round onions on a T-bone steak, my stomach growling yo I want some
Hold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knocked at the door
Act like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face
Push me in quickly when the bitch open up
Remember you don't me, blast him if he reach for his gun
Yo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie
No matter rain, sleet or snow you know you suppose to phone me
Off came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door
The door flew open, dude had his mouth open
Frozen, stood still with his heat bulgin'
Told him Freeze! lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment
Frank snatched his gat, slapped him, axed him
Where's the cash, coke and the crack? Get the smoke and you fast
His wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon
Ran in the kitchen, threw a shot, then kicking the four fifth
Broke a bone in her wrist and she dropped the heat
Give up the coke! But the bitch wouldn't listen
I'm on the floor like holy shit! Watchin my man Frank get busy
He zoned out, finished off my man's wiz
He let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'
Foamin' out the mouth, I'm scared
Frank screamin', blowin' shots in the air
Missin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear
Killed that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first
Frank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon
The coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad moves
The big one had the centipede stab wound
Frank shot the skinny dude, laid him out
The bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out

Pullin' up mad slow blunted, passin' police cars
I saw one two three bodies
Blood mixed with the rain ran through the gutter
That's the work of a tommy
But then I heard it was the work of a mami
Spanish chick bad, about five six, long hair, red Jag
Kinda bowlegged, Chanel sweatpants, she thick
She love her some pussy, don't really give a fuck about dick
That's when I got the call, yo Tone come to the shop
Some fire jumped, chill I'm about to pull in the lot
Lowered the tunes, pulled the Benz keys out the ignition
Brushed the ashes off my blazer then finished my Guinness
So then I walked in, seen the God shufflin' cards
Spades game, it's goin' down, he lost a couple of yards
Peace Lord, how your physical?
He upstate miserable
Stressed, doin' a thousand sets
But yo check the visuals
I'm at this hotel in Queens
Me and Charene getting' slow necked
That's live, I couldn't finish the bean
Gotta a phone call, seen the whole bitch face fall
Dope fiend look like the bitch swallowed an eight ball
They talkin' about killin' ya man's and them
That kid from Staten, his jewels is tough, his robes is satin
Yo that's my heart Tone; yea yea he killed the captain
What nationality nigga? The kid was Latin
It happened uptown, broad day, right in Manhattan
I was shoppin' with my home girl, Leona with acne?
But you know what, Flaco meets Lolita
Flew in, she from Medayeen, he deaded her uncle over them seventeen bricks
Niggas ain't slick, niggas is dicks
Y'all got beef for life now cause that bitch is a trick
Ay yo fuck that, close the gate
And lower the shade
Then a shot popped off
Hit lil' bro in his fade
And then I see him dropped his clippers
He dipped with the quickness
It was Lolita black down yo
With four other bitches
He had a nasty hammer, fat ass
Her tits was bananas
Yo the clip was ninety shot
She lit up the cameras
So then I bugged out, ran up the steps
Yo I got hit in the leg
He shot back, hit one bitch in her breast
Under the pinball game aimin'
It's foggy and rainin'
My jewels is clangin'
Yo Tone tuck your chain in
She shootin' like she wanted a payment
Throwin' bullets like Joe Nameth, yellin'
Yo it's all entertainment
Where y'all girls at? Where ya'll pussies at?
Thought y'all bang on Gaten Island?
I killed three things on Staten Island
Take that!
You fuckin' with me huh?!
That's all you got babyyyyyy?
Hold that! Motherfuckaaaaa!
Yea! You on Staten Island now nigga!
Now where the fuck is your brain at now ho?
You fuckin' with me, brains is all over the wall like Velcro
I fuck your pussy while you die slow
Wake up! You cock suckin' ass maricon
That's what you get for killin' Frankie
Tony Starks, Tony Starks drop you weapons now
Put your weapons down or we will shoot
Ay yo Rae I got this

Surprise she stay on her toes like a prized ballerina

This pretty thing handle her biz, she carry those things
Ready to die like she related to B.I.G.

And go hit shorty, shaking that thang, cuz

""Tony Starks!"" ""Ironman!""
You done slept on Tony
""Yo, before that, I was getting it on""
You done slept on Tony
""Tony Starks!"" ""Ironman""
You done slept on Tony
""I was getting it, getting it, getting it on""
Yo, when they kidnapped your boy, and forced me to do evil
I created an iron suit, to protect my people
Escaped, bound to be Ironman the great
The billionaire Tony Starks'll renew your fate
Built Stark Towers, throw the biggest events
Got liquid, armor, I can paint all dents
Keep a few bad chicks, I ain't your average hero
Movie premieres, catch me with the zam enginero
Six six eleven gold, playboy industrialist
Face of a ghost, mind of a technologist
Specialist, modern day speech slang therapist
Scecialize in weapons, I can blow off terrorists
So, so don't sleep big homey
Real recognize and I can see you phoneys
My weak heart can't take it, got a life long sentance
Boy genius grown up, and I fight with a vengeance
Chorus
Yo, I got steel toe wallies when I glide on stage
And my heart gently weeps in an iron ribcage
Punctured by metals, replaced by elements
My enemies hunt it like a tusk on the elephant
Extraordinary, hiding my duel identities
Anthony Stark, call me Ton', the top pedigree
Multi-billionaire, military contractor
Crushing my opponents, with the strength of a compactor
Ex-factor, I turn liquids to metals
Water to wine, I turn dirt into rose petals
Greatest man walking, blow a bottle of Goose
Goldy plat iron armor, to Versace suits
I'm so elegant, scientifically intelligent
My lawyers won the case, I won't take the settlement
Money's irrelevant, I need heat to energize
We taking over the planet, Stark Enterprise
Chorus
Once again, Tony Stark, infinite finesse
Stopped the planet, and destroyed an indestructable track

So hard to appreciate... (appreciate)
Each moment, of each day
Life's quick, don't flip, move slow, ya rushing it
Oh... oh... oh...
Looking lavish, I lace all my bunnies with karets
Spending millions and make music, I pay for the clearance
Cuz tomorrow ain't promised and my bankroll's bursting
Connects with Aston Martin, I'll be that first in
That prototype truck, with the space navigation
Cost of living go up, I'm just go on vacation
Fresh oxygen tanks, got world reknowned surgeons
Plush robes made from suede and knitted by virgins
First breath of the day can be my last
So I flash, give my niggaz some cash, I just pull out the stash
Buy a million dollar piece like I buy a pack of seeds
You buy OZ's of haze, I buy a forest full of trees
Chorus
Order that bottle of Louis the fifth and some Dom P
I got a bunch of chicks that love to get raunchy
See, Tone double-dipped and I nut like Flanders
Ask Tamia and Chevon, I got 'em both going bananas
Buying frosted bracelets, Louis Voutton duffles
French vanilla ice cream and hot apple pie truffles
Fly me, to Costa Rica, I got a crib on the beach
With underwater lights and surround sound speakers
Pet cheetahs, tiger sharks and dolphin feeders
Fly French maids, serving Grey Goose by the liters
Got Felecia and Taquesha, Crystal and Katie
Little Precious, picking my poppy seeds out in Haiti

Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
Yes, ladies and gentlemen
We have a special guest for you this evening
Ghost, you ready?
[Ghostface]
Yo, I verbally paint pictures, I'm the hood's best storyteller
This about a young boy dealing with the older fellas
Promised him the lives you see on TV
He ran packs across town like rhyme CD's
And big chains, new clothes, Nikes and Reeboks
Stacking too much loot to squeeze in a shoe box
Saving, he promised his mom a crib in Atlanta
And his pops got killed through debt, he was a dealer
So he staged jazz, fox jump off the suit cases
No more cross-town, now he's crossing them states and
Seeing new faces, not knowing who to trust
So when the door kicked open they scream ""This is a bust""
""Is it a set up?"", it seems funny, a scuffle broke out
He got hit, dropped the cases spitting blood out of his mouth
He walked four blocks to die trying to survive
And now all that's left is his mom screaming ""God Why?""
[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
[Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, yeah, let me begin by saying ""Shut the fuck up!""
Let my begin by saying I don't think this man knew what he had in store
He opened the door and found the bag under the floor
Not a peep, always working a lot, get the flame, aim, pop
Open the box and take off out the back of the pawn shop
Scoping the lot, hoping the cops hadn't seen the plates on his car
He felt like he been hustling so hard like a demon he pumped a cold heart
Play it cool like Humphrey Bogart, put the rings on his chain attached by both parts
He did the drop, one ring in a bag, envelope, all the money he had
Left the money and the ring in a slow exhale
Two weeks went by, got a box in the mail
In the box was a bullet made of gold
Melted down from the ring, recast with two rings and a band
And he stared at it sitting in the palm of his hand
And sat down next to a picture that sat on the nightstand
It was his wife in the picture on his side
With the ring on the finger on the week that she died
As he looked in the reflection, at those eyes so red
He put the bullet in a gun and put it right in his head like that
[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
Uh, yeah, uh
Fiasco!
[Lupe Fiasco]
You know he didn't have enough power in his thrusters to muster Warp 5
Plus if he pushed it, the fuel cells could rupture then they would die
Then the galaxy would suffer but he knew he had to try
But he couldn't risk it, put the cure in the escape pod and kissed it
And told her goodbye, she started to cry, but he knew if he could distract 'em
He could buy her some time and she could make it out alive
Turn the suit around and got prepared for the stand off
Space mind had blew one of the hands off
Damaged laser cannons and he got the system jammed
And he faced the whole fleet, blood seeping through his teeth
The final saga in the seven planet wars
Unsheethed the sword and then he charged forward
His eyes flashed behind the cracked cockpit glass
He let out a laugh and then all she heard was a blast like
[Lupe Fiasco][Chorus]
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
I use to write in every color I think in
To paint a picture with every rhyme that I speak in
Yeah, the gallery is the beat then I... I... I... I...
Yeah, ladies and gentlemen
This has been a Fort Minor production
Ghostface! Fiasco!
Uh, spraypaint and ink pens
It's an expression coming out of a simple can of paint
Look, it's the easiest way for the average kid to paint things using himself as the meaning of it
You gonna get into the gallery there soon, man
Why? I'm not gonna be famous one day
Why do you always say that?
Cause it's true

Kiss your feet, make love to you, like I do
Wake you up, in the night tank and surprise you
Cross my heart, swear, put my hand on the bible

The best thing for me is when I'm laying beside you

On the dance floor, I'm sweating my ass off
Imagining us in deep lust, how you look with your pants off
My one-two step, your dress is so spun
And your neck smell good, look cute when you chewing your gum and
From the womb to the tomb, you're blessed with a killa walk
You don't have to give me none, it's ight, we'll talk
Someone who loves you
Only half as much as I do

Don't get it twisted, black, cuz I'll bury ya
This is just weed money, the more, the merrier
Chorus
They call me the Superman lover
Said, they call me the Superman lover
Yeah, plus I'm wrong...
Aiyo, G4 jets with like three and four pets
Sex, Beck's, chicken and hens, all the same sex
Walk through the Amazon, spilling Dom, Moet
To find my way back I gotta leave a trail of bagettes
My tongue's like a four-pound, my game is ill
Twist a chick like a Rubik's cube, now what's the deal?
Chocolate, light skin, meet Mr. Excitement
Got my D.D.L. on me, that's my Dick 'em Down License
Never wife 'em, strike just like lightning
I stay piping, hype just like Hype is
Bitches wanna see me and my rindstone drawers
Call in sick at work, then they take off
For me, spread 'em out for Starky
My mouth may drizzle like BizMarkie
I get it in like any car key
My stroke is on, I'm never rusty
Uh-uh, but if you wanna play, this is what you gonna say
That I got the best D, he could hit it all day
Something like a rising star that's on Broadway
Sex real live with a Illmatic foreplay
Chorus
Oh shit, it's that Bally, it's that slick Bally
'88 material, little niggaz don't know nothing about this though
Check it out y'all (look) come on (look) yeah, come on
(Up in the sky) When I'm at the bar, or in a rented car (look)
(You'll see me flying by) Ya see the jewerly truck, don't touch
Yeah, yeah, come on, when I'm in the streets
Might show you the heat (look, flying straight past ya)
Chorus
Toney Starks Radio (something ain't wrong with me)
Mama got a big butt, mama got a big butt
Toney Starks Radio right here
Mama got a big butt, mama got a big butt
Smooth FM, you know how we do, come on
Wave ya hand in the air like this
Mami, wave ya hands in the air like this
Put 'em up if you trying to get rich
Put 'em up if you trying to get rich
Uh, that's right, get rich
Let's go, that's right, get rich

This guy is a bulldozer with a wrecking ball attached
He'll leave a ring around your eye and tread marks on your back
He's an animal
He's hungry
You ain't been hungry, since ""Supreme Clientele""
Remember what you first told me when I took ya in
You wanted to be a fighter (Yeah!)
You wanted to be a killer (New York Stand Up)
You wanted to be the Champ! (Got your boy in the booth nigga)
You ain't hungry
Matter of fact I don't want you in my gym
Get out of my ring, you disgust me
[Ghostface Killah]
Godzilla bankroll
Stones from Stilion
Yo I ain't got it all, that means I barely home
Trailblazer stay ballin
Revenge is my arts is crafty darts
While y'all stuck on Laffy Taffy
Wonderin' how y'all niggaz get past me
I been doin this before Nas dropped the Nasty
My wallos I did 'em up
Them bricks I send 'em up
My raps y'all bit 'em up
For that now stick 'em up
Ten Four good buddy Tone got is money up
Worth millions still back your bitch lookin bummy what
Ya'll staring at the angel of death
Liar liar pants on fire You burning up like David Koresh
This is architect music
Verbal street opera pop a 'tec man fully got the projects booming indeed
I ran through the tunnel
Terrorize speed
That's when I was still in the jungle slangin that D
[Spoken over the beat]
Get out my face! No you ain't got no mo?'.
Don't need no has been messin' up my corner
And you better get that mad look off your face for I knock it off
Hey fool you ready for another beating
You should have never came back
Look here man after I crucify him, you next!
And you better have a good doctor to rearrange your face
I'm the Champ!
[Ghostface Killah]
Who want to battle the Don?
I'm James Bond in the Octagon with two razors
Bet cha'all didn't know I had a fake arm
I lost it, wild and raw before rap, I was gettin' it on
Took a fat nigga out in like 40secs
My gun get hard wit a 45 still erects and eagle on
Kangol hat slanted coconut bounce to Morocco
Guerilla medallions like Flavor Flav clock yo
Niggaz want me dead but they scared to step to me
Rip they guts out like a hysterectomy
When beef collide look on the flip by the penitentiary kite
Or get you bumped off from the inside
Jaws is hanging
Frauds is leftin they draws on the floor complaining
Bird ass nigga resemble Keenon Ivory Waynes
Stay in your place dirt born rappers get Shadow box for training ?
Ya'll still eatin bacon
[Spoken over the beat]
Think nobody can; don't give this nigga no statue give him death
I told y'all I wasn't going away
You had your shot no give me mine
Now why don't you tell these folks why you been ducking me, politics man
You think you going to keep me down
They don't want me to have the title
Because I'm not a puppet like that fool up there
Ask his woman she get more pipe from the plumber than in bed
I'm the Champ!
[Ghostface Killah]
I like the deuce of diamonds cutting spades on a glass table
Half a mil on my left ankle
Terry cloth Guess shorts robes is comfortable
Bring me a nice bitch that means I'll fuck with you
My swagger is Mick Jaeger stones is rolling
Prestige is cut to it tis ? spark when weed went up
The Cocoa leaf is slightly damp
Sprouting in the backyard next to Gran duke tomato plants
And jets get charted marquee shit with the cars on it
They head and they earl to the toilet and vomit
Back East summer MC king since Cuban
Pretty Tone Iron Man and Bulletproof and Supreme
Proof and you double deuce in the jeans
My man ? was on the floor with the mother load both of them green
IBF WBC Cruiserweight title shots and Rap belts belong to D.C.
[Spoken over the beat]
Listen I am bad, I said I am bad
I'm a bad man
I'm so bad sometimes I's scare myself
Sometimes I look in the mirror and want to kiss myself I'm so pretty
Now who am I (The Man!)
Now who am I (The Man!)

Shopping sprees, with my mans on the corner watch D's
Rolling in threes, in them purple capri's'

I don't want the streets to play a melody...
(yeah, it's hip hop, it's hip hop
The mic needs to be a little bit more crystal)
I don't want to hear the good time is coming..
Don't want to hear the voices in back of me...
(youknowhatI'msaying? Cuz I'm bout to go in)
I'm not gonna hear it! I don't want the drummer..
Awwwww, Meth Tical, yo, you stepped on my corns and shit
Got the charm lit, bomb wrist, what type of arm is this?
I seen you at the Grammy's with a triple Bar Mitz'
Can I kick it? (Hell No!)
That's why she got hair in her elbows and she real slow
And a, every two weeks she gotta see her P.O
She's a disgrace to signs, she fuck it up for Leos
Method Man (Toney Starks) the most important M.C. in the whole wide world
Is you and you hardly even know it, know it, know it..
Watch me shock the world, move the masses like a landslide
It's a literal stickup, everybody's (hands high)
See the bigger, picture, I'm out for the grand prize
I'm not a role player, senor, I'm the franchise
Aiyo, with Trife sweatin', every bullet is life threatenin'
And you could get a chest full of slugs in a slight second
Yo, my nine milli' pistol's really official
So you can Analyze That like DeNiro and Billy Crystal
Aiyo, it's Ghost with the sky blue kufi, smashin' groupies
Leavin' them fiend out, like New Jack's Pookie
Every line is like ninety nine dimes
Shrine auditorium rap, aquarium's in my wall in the back
Now that you know my name, niggaz know my game
If you feel me, then you know my pain
I seen you rap dudes done stole my slang, try'nna hold my fame
Ain't even strong enough to hold my thang
Wanna flow, fuck with me though, baby, I'mma try'nna see dough
My squad got them caught in the yard screamin' for C.O
Every time we blow, it raise the prize on the padrico
Ya'll niggaz shoot your guns like Shaq shootin' a free throw
Spark the fluid, hop out and park the Buick
I got fiends blowin' CREAM like Martha Stewart
We on that up north jail shit, harder than steel chips
Ya'll niggaz better bail quick, before you inhale clips
Ya'll better get low, before I let the Tec blow
Streetlife, I'mma try'nna get more dollars than Kreftlo
The whole hood echoes, every time my nine let go
Get out of line or steal your life like a klepto
When Biggie died, they came out with Biggie fries
Big biscuits got me over, in the streets wide
Prada gloves, layin' for thugs, prayin'
Drop a bronco buster, G-37 on the rap patient
I'mma leave the shit this summer in that H2 Hummer now
Mami gotta call your bean ass ay caramba, now
Eh boy el loco, oh no, I ain't Yoko
My hoes, I keep 'em lookin' good, right, but no dough
I don't want no horns blowing..
I don't want the -- I don't want the drummer..
I don't want the -- I don't want the drummer..

Ay yo, movin' on these niggas like they old soul, bro
You know how we go, we go shift 'em out like Paleco
Fine, proteges off top connectin' like a buildin'
Four dollar whylin' niggas buildin', savin' the children
Come on now, check out the view like a oceanfront
Slow motion in cunt, takin' what we want
You know a kid asiatic, holdin' power like a Craftmatic
You like your fish fried or battered, that day he ratted
Check out the movies from Guyana, just eatin' in Atlanta
Makin' some pirate moves out of Savannah
Yeah, rock them niggas like jewelry
Arabics movin' blow like aerobics
That's when his nose itch, yeah
That means it's all in effect

Get all up in you, oh yeah your friend too, respect Wu
Yeah, keep the faggot niggas watery
Rhyme for rich niggas who supported me, shorty pussy extorted me
So it's a science now, RZA, cuttin' they pockets like scissors

Flashin' gems, eight-and-a-half Tim state robber
All my life been on some foul shit besides kidnap a child shit
Get on some foul and proud shit
Cheatin' many Koreans bein' all that I can be an'
Put down on thirty keys an' get to fleein'
Light up a tree an'
Don't be breezin' like a blowdryer
Yo, you's a liar like Jeremiah gamin' on the flyer
Yo, but buryin' niggas is carryin'
Thug drug marryin', hittin' Marion off at the Clarion

I see buds that are green, red roses too
I see the blunts, for me and you
And I say to myself,
what a wonderful world..

It's the illest little story for all the girls and boys
Wonderland you should see it, ch-yo
Animated actors that become ya toys
Once you see it, don't believe, ch-yo

Aiyo, my wiz play the flute, I stroll through the forest like
Peace, pussies, trees, hello, how was your day? Have you seen the prince?
Haven't seen him since he pushed Humpty Da-Dumpty fell off the fence
The smurfs fell out laughin', Heckle toe Jeckle at min,
They took my medicade card, he's a good friend
Bugs still sniffin', Daffy Duck snitchin'
And heard that crazy Bird took the stand on the Simpsons
Bet you ""my golly, oh glory"" with a story to tell
Droopy got knocked, now he Muslim in jail
His name is Abdrul, Colorful, Snow White tattoo
She used to send him mad flicks in Cash Rule
And the cat too, old girl who's clackin' her shoes
And that wicked witch broke her broom, clappin' at school
It happens every night, I seen it, shoot outs in Jellystone Park
Kermit had the whip, he did from the Narks
They bagged Woody, Shaggy shot dead in his hoodie
Tweety did the Bird, ""I thaw, I thought I thaw a putty""
Ghost, please you don't even want to know
Droopy Long wrote a song, like to hear it, here it go...
Ricochet Rabbit had a habit, he was savage
Bruto slapped, Magoto slapped out his glasses backwards
Magelity used to come to class wit rachets
He was known in the hood, plus good for his classics
Slashes, blast four-fifths, diamond cut, hollow point tips
Big Boy bustin' out his corderoy fix
Eleven, way beyond is little boy fit
Magoo, he gon' catch him at the teachers' conference
So later that week durin' open school night
Everybody there, saw open school fight
Blows is big, Olive Oil was pissed
The wolf was too, they murdered one of the pigs
He said, ""What great big heat you have""
He replied, ""Fuck my gun I'll eat you fast""
He said, ""What great big teeth you have""
""Mothafu- you better look at all the beef you have""
[Chorus]
[Ghostface Killah]
After that though, Jerry, Tom's the cat, Ruther Rats
Riff rat, courageous cat, Jossie and the Pussycats
Porky Pig ripped shag, Elmer Fudd's double snub cartoon gat
Had sat in the back of the Hat, the hippos had O's
Wilma had fucked Johnny Bravo
Richie had his shit snatched then yapped at a live show
That bitch dollar boated yo, Astro screamed on Dino
That's what he gets for ass-betting Snoopy C-low
Goofy had kilos, big hole in his nose, wind blows
Heard he was Moe, and showed how he rolled
Peter Pan's the man, he heard Grammy was blood-ed
She shot Ms. Piggy, she's superior on her set
Pippy Long Stocking had it poppin'
Her and Barney had an army out in pink house, the shit was rockin'
Guess who got rich and bounced? Scrooge McDuck, he had an ounce
Ain't no money out in CandyLand, we out...

Black blades, one hundred dollar seats
Hold up, we at the opera
Queen Elizabeth rub on my leg
Had ketchup on her dress from a whopper
Chunky ass necklace
Must be her birthstone
John Paul cop the biggest stones outta Rome
Told ya eyes up on her prince
Fucking with Diana
Two rows across, Dirty giving hickeys to Vianna White
Fingering Pamela Lee
We on the balcony
Dare one of ya'll to Malcolm X me

""License and registrations""

Chicken heads they was racing wit' they hearts pacin'

Trying' to dip into the god's basement

Cracked shorty head
Left sweetie there for dead

Fingers sticky from cheese doodles
Starving' for a 50 cent bag of Oodles and Noodles
Neighborhood sick wit' it
Clinton 'bout to cut WIC
Maybe one ya'll rich rap niggas need to politic
Reach for the sky
They throw bleach in your eye
Don't teach you why
You be keeping 'em high
Dipped like an Oreo cookie
In cold milk, bold silk
Gold-filled cap, Wu wear hat,
Low tilt

We speak verbal rhyme phonics

This Nigga just bought eleven machine guns
And he brought them in my crib

Glittered out, stout face, teck, Rae up in the Hilton
Heard Nia Long is in the building
Penthouse fashion, ordered out room service
It looked bugged cause the waiter looked nervous
Lift off the lid, seen two shiny thirty-eights aimed at the kid
What I do, duck!
Rae up in the shower singing
Son don't know that it's real
Coming looking like he about peel something
In a tight jam, red down, matching like santa
If I could just reach my hammer
He bust two shots, I played mice
Ran to the spot were the sun was at, quickly he was blinded by the ice
That's when Rae ran out of the back
Towel on, soap on his arms, spit duke around, fell on my lap
(Raekwon)
Yo, what the fuck happened?
(Ghostface Killah)
It was a set up to get wet up

Starks your bleeding

Nah, his blood fucked my white leather up
Ten G's down the drain
Yo hurry up, we got to get him up
Get the sheets son, let's fix him up
Lock the door, turn the TV off, your kicks is near the light switch

Just give me two minutes to iron my shirt, find my ices

Wipe off your prints

Slipped on soap
Landed on his back, with his gat, now that's dope
We got three minutes, nobody seen shit
Somebody might have heard shit
Singing on some Martin, were my momma bird shit
Fuck your socks, that's when we heard the door knock
Everything all right? Partying son, balloons popped
Threw this dude under the bed
A half dressed Raekwon, swallowing diamonds
Had money in juice up on his wedding day
The phone rang off, the tea kettle blew, wifey hitting me,
What you want sweaty, lima beans and kidney
Trashed the beeper, slowly I reached for the reefer
Throw a Costa, peep oh son the house keeper
Soap suds dripping from his nuts, cut up gut
Praying how me make it out the telly and touch
(Chorus - Ghostface Killah)
Fuck it, a Wesley Snipes movement on a Sunday in Bermuda
We laptop niggas, thugs in a computer
Caught up in the grimy shit

Ayo, the pressures on, sonny got murk
Its time to move fast
Ayo, Deini it's on, check out the news flash
Flew out the next day, back to the Tony estates
Blew on the first class flight to L.A.
It ain't take long, I pulled a few strings on the horn
So were it came from?
That nigga we stuck and took the caine from
We should have killed him when we had him
Yo I was holding a Magnum
Yeah we bagged him, but we let him slide in the wagon
His bad little brown ho, from out Chicago
She move his cargo, good at handling Roscoes
We had our eyes closed God, we should have seen it coming
He should have seen me coming, running out the shower gunning
Now that I figured it, she put the waiter on
It all came to me, in back of my mind, just like my favorite song
Dawned on me later on
By then the day was gone
How dare this nigga even think that he could take us on
Smoke the Cee Allah
Sent the kite through the Pens
Him and big Dan
Known to split wigs, with razor sharp gems
Giants from Attica riots
Halls is quiet
CO's with babies on their arms look tight
And this nigga from down state got shipped up north
Stocky young fella, running his lips on how he set it off
Then heard that shit, plus got that kite
Money got murdered in his bunk that night

He got three rounds, we all ex-dealers
Ex-killers, we gon' ride to the death for the skrilla
I hold my own and rep my niggas
Always oil my guns and inspect my triggas
Sometimes I call my lawyer just to check my figures
He told me not to worry, all cheques is clearin'
So fuck my rhymes, I got the best appearance
And I survive through project experiences
You wanna roll dice or roll and ride?
No matter, you gon' get holes inside
See you fuckin' with Theodore Dieni
You fuckin' with a metaphor King Pin
You fuckin' with him? Wu-Tang
Wu, you fuckin' with them?
Dun, do you wanna gun to make you slim?
So I'ma pop my collar, get my dollars
Pop all parlors and fuckin' with money scholars?
Matter of fact I'm gonna fuck with rockweilers
[Chorus: Superb]
Pop your collar (do whatever you do best)
Get your dollar (New York, up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop your collar (you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (New York, say no more, New York, say no more..)
[Trife]
Let off the Jackey Don, rollin' the dice with a happy arm
Everything good, money on wood
Bank stoppers, I send them home broke
Have them all in they stash, bettin' they own coat
I takes it all, fifty and better, you make the call
Watch you break your all, big sixes cuz I'm a nigga who don't like to fall
High roller, see how my dice kiss
Push you pay me, and if I roll trips you pay me twice bitch
I rocks, believe it or not
Come broke to a dice game, step off and leave with a knot
Head cracks is all you see when I'm hot
What's in the pop? A 00 g's to the bank to the man, who got it stopped
My hand is like a gun, feel the heat when it's cocked
4-5-6 your heart drop, way deep in your socks
You wanna walk, broke your ass down the street with a bop
The drinks is on you tonight, from my peeps in the spot
[Chorus: Superb]
Pop your collar (do whatever you do best, yo)
Get your dollar (up the ladder to the hill of success)
Pop your collar (you know what we gonna do)
Just pop your collar (pop us, do us)

Sometimes I wonder, do he love me
Life is so hard for me
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
I pray every night asking for forgiveness
Sometimes ask myself is it worth it
Life is so pain, painful
Yet I'm so thank, thankful
Life wont be easy and I know that
My past is over, wish I can go back
Maybe I change-anges
Rearrange-anges
Sometimes times in life we all feel like we are feel like we falling
Those who suffer in life will be rewarded
Lord I hear you but it's so hard being strong
I keep reminiscing all my loved ones that are gone
He says hun you should know you're born to die
I say I do it's just so hard saying bye

[Intro: The Force MD's]
Whoaahhhoahhh, oahhhohhhhh
It's been a long, long
A long time coming
A change gon' come
[Verse One: Ghostface]
Yo, yo these streets got me backed down how can I escape?
How can I survive without bubblin weight?
It's prepared for the stand off, once you hand off
that white rock, and then give birth to a knot
Your biggest dream was to rock your 850 and beam
You and the Gods buy a crib in the white part of Queens
But at the same time, niggaz on the block is ill
Some'll rock you to sleep, hap, for selling cross pills
Being watched all day like enemy's prey
Faces, you never seen before is in your hallway
Brothers you knew for years is mad pussy and scared
Back in the days U.F.O.'s couldn't walk up in here
It's time to motor, travel like a foul order
Clear my head, stay sober, the soul controller
[Chorus: The Force MD's]
Oahhhh, it's been a long, long
A long time coming
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will
Said I'm too, tired of livin
But I'm, but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there
In that great big ol' sky
[Verse Two: Ghostface]
Sink deep into the fog, big buffalo large
Taj Mahal just got banged, shanked for eighty dollars
It's hard to keep up, with these key-ons, that smoke dust
In the U.S. Mint they want to rock the place and call the rush
All these shameless niggaz armed with cherry-red Bally's
On the twenty-fifth, everybody rich is gettin married
Killed for power beans, your brother own schools in Medina
Vaseline lips is cracked cause they all had dreams
They overdue, these Gods own a mosque in Peru
Tropical trees and weaves where they grew bamboo
Olympic minds quick flash like a leak on
A hundred shares short to own Nissan, watch em get they feast on
Royal blue lies inside the eyes of heaven
Curse the head, who speak foul and jinx number seven (seven)
Clear my head and stay sober, the soul controller...
(Stay sober, the soul controller)
[Chorus: The Force MD's]
Oahhh, been a long time comin
Oh yeah
A change gon' come
Woooaahh, yes it will
[Verse Three: Ghostface]
Yo, yo we sit and play the wall like nine super heroes
Late for the man choose and hit socks and stereos
The kid's nice, warnin you twice, run your garmets
Jet to Providence, switch up and back down your Parliament
Ironman is laced with a plate inside the dome piece
Go off in airports, biographies, prophecies
Watch me set it, real key-ons hold down the desert
And walk with a famous name like Supreme Magnetic
Carbon copy, I love my car, it's near choppy
Melachi off the funky pain with the wax poppy on instrumentals
Niggaz get lost like S.S. Minnows
Turned out like rentals, keep gold around the denim
[Outro Part One: The Force MD's]
A change gon come
Yes it will
It's been a long, long
A long time coming
A change gon come
Wooo, yes it will
Said I'm so
Tired of living
But I'm, but I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there
In that great, big ol sky
Oh my, oh my, oh my
It's been a long, long time
A long time coming
Change gonna come
Wooo, yes it will
[Outro Part Two: (from the motion picture ""Carlito's Way"")]
Sorry boys,
All the stitches in the world can't sew me together again
Lay down, lay down
Gonna stretch me out in Fernandez funeral home on hun and ninth street
Always knew I'd make a stop there
But a lot later than a whole gang of people thought
Last of the Mohicans
Well, maybe not the last
Can't come with me on this trip, Loaf
Gettin the shakes now
Last call for drinks
Bar's closin down
Sun's out
Where we goin for breakfast?
Don't wanna go far
Rough night
Tired, baby
Tired...
[Outro Part Three: (from the motion picture ""The Usual Suspects"")]
Greatest trick the devil ever pulled
Was convincing the world he didn't exist
And like that, he's gone

[Ghostface Killah]
I'd love to make you happy, buy an island off Miami
Feed your mother and your family, my wildest fantasies
Take place, overlooking real high mountains
They wrote our name in the sky, see baby, we bout it!
This is all us, Adam and Eve if you want
This time, we respect God's work from the jung'
That's all you ever said, Ghost fed, many heads
Broke dead, I'm going bald, girl, I can't grow dreads
Kiana told Deb, on the moped
CiCi Vet on the beach steps give me slow neck
She's lyin', she be on X
She's tired, she a house wreck (that's right)
Don't buy it, tell me why you said that (""Cause you left me..."")
I never left you, you left me
You thought if you break out from the kids, you'll be stress free
Talkin' bout it, baby, you my first lady
You let me suck up on them nipples
When I get cranky, and taste your kitty
So girl, won't you on come back down to Earth
Once you land on the Rock, you gonna always see a dirt
Face first, they the worst, they searched and searched
And the worst, don't it hurt, my love, stay alert
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Two things that you can't touch: My money, my girl
The he-say and she-say could fuck up your world
Playa-haters, perpetrators, house-breakers
Can you see the fact that nigga try'nna live life?
I was raised in a jungle, and stumbled on hills
And didn't nobody ask me on how did I feel
But that sugar and my spice, that's wife
She's my lady, and we just wanna live right, uh

Oh shit, yo, yo, run!

Aiyo, I jumped from the 8th floor step, hit the ground
The pound fell, cops is coming
Runnin' through the pissy stairwells, I ain't hear nothin'
Buggin', only thing I remember was the bullshit summon
so I stopped at the 2nd floor, ran across, cracks is fallin'
My pockets is lean, clean when I vanished off
Took off, made track look easy
The walkie talkies them D-E-T's had, black, they was rated P.G
Run, I will knock your bug, no, quick flag the car down
Take me to.. Ghost here they come now!
Errr! Pull off quick, back up, hit the bitch, dog
Turned down Hill, light the Marley spliff
Run! I will not get bagged on the rock
Run! I seen what happened to Un, they bad with they cops
Run! They am' shit, plan shit, destroy evidence
Get cassed, I'm not comin' home with no fifty six
Die with the heart of Scarface and take fifty licks
Before I let these crackers throw me and shit
Bounce if you a good kid, bounce, do the bird hop
Curse, swerve to get served, these cocksuckers got nerve
Heard I was killin' shit, they must got word
That I told the chief on Rich Port I don't wanna merge
[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
Run! If you sell drugs in the school zone
Run! If you gettin' chased with no shoes on
Run! Fuck that! Run! Cops got, guns!
They givin' out life like bird tons
Run! If you ain't do shit, you it
That next felony, nigga, it's like three zip
So, run! Hop fences, jump over benches!
When you see me comin' get the fuck out the entrance!

Yo, uh, it's Task Force Tuesday, the NARCS is in the black car
I got fine hundred, hundred packs in my backyard
Clear twelve-twelve's, that look like stuff shells
I'm cuttin' niggaz throats on the sails, while they puff L's
Don't leave nothin' unbagged, shave everything
I learned from the O.G.'s to save everything (to save everything)
They come by one more time, they gon' hop out
They two deep, and one is a bitch, she gettin' knocked out
Then I can get rid of the pack
but I just copped this pretty chrome thing, so I'm dippin' with that
Uh, down-shiftin' on 'em like I got gears on me
(Run!) Besides that, I got about 5 years on me
(Run!) Scared to death, runnin' like I got bears on me
(Run!) My Timb's start feelin' like they Nike Air's on me
(Run!) It's hard for me to slow down, it's like I'm on the Throughway
My belt's in the crib on the floor by my two-way
Now I'm try'nna hold my hammer up, and my pants too
If they don't kill me, they gon' give me a number I can't do
Rather it be the streets, then jail where I die at
And I'm ashmatic, so I'm lookin' for somewhere to hide at
But they too close, and I got this new toast
'Magine if I would of let off a shot or two, you know what I gotta do

Son, can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slipped down a bid, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock the five in ya slippers

Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow dem
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years
Son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit
Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit
I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin'
And you mad cuz you a older clock, couple rocks missin'
And my writin', the band, you can say it's ice flight-nin'

Blast the last uzi, ship me to Africa, right? I share rubies
Due to the night up on my behalf
I threw the shotti in the glass so I could have a double bash
Duffle pass, couples, teamed with the knuckle clash, fast
Rain, hail, snow, sleet, still bust that ass

Gun on the hip, posted for hours, slingin' dope and power

Got remote control cars and they're not made by Tyco
This the Theodore, drunk off Smirnoff
Bit ya ear off, therefore, the drama is what I'm here for

Feel the strangest, if no money exchanges
I got these kids in Ranges, to leave them niggaz brainless
All they tote is stainless, you just remain as
calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo' killings clean, slugs up in between
they eyes, like ""True Lies,"" kill 'em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, your life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin with put bombs in your mom's gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece (uh-huh)
Enough to cop a six; buy the house on the beach (uh-huh)
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now that's damn near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed

Niggaz got to die, let a hundred shots float
Niggaz got to die, cause it's all up in the scrolls

Layin on the bed, lookin like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, lookin at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who woulda ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
on these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitchin noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
That's when 6 to 7 masked men, came in blastin yo

Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggaz)

Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams, (niggaz) respect winners

Let me break it down for you, all I wanted to know
If I could just feel it and touch it, and break it down into numbers and
Come with me and just leave your friends
Cuz we don't need no cock blocking
Tellin' you this without no option
Tell your friends ""Peace, look, I'm bouncin'""
[Chorus: Missy Elliott (Ghostface Killah)]
Tush, tush, tush
Wanna slide in the bush, bush, bush?
(I'm on top, you like push, push, push
Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You wanna get up in my tush, tush, tush?
You could slide in the bush, bush, bush
(I'm on top, you like push, push, push
Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
You wanna get up in that tush, tush, tush?
Wanna slide in my bush, bush, bush
(I'm on top, you like push, push, push
Keep it low like shush, shush, shush)
[Ghostface Killah]
Oh yeah, you jinglin' baby (well let me jump up on that ding-a-ling baby)
Ooh, gosh, you a nasty girl, sassy
Picture me layin' you inside my classic pearls
Toes'll curl, giddy up, you go girl
I'm about to, uh, do it slow girl
Ooh, you in control, it's in your world
She on, I think I like ol' girl
Take it out, turn around
Charlie horse, shit, threw me off balance
Wildin', all I wanted was to show you my talent
To let you know on how I rep in Staten Island
This is the reason I came to you
So we can connect it then kick it was the thing to do
Cuz we don't need no representation
Domination, got them waitin' patient
[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Now this is the way ya'll suppose to
To get dowwnnnnnnnn, ya'll ain't right
Somebody say ""Aha! Ghost is back!""
[Missy Elliott]
Pull back the curtain, let me work your sermon
Playboy don't hurt me like a virgin
You seem real determined to put a hurtin'
But if you ain't slurpin', then you better off jerkin'
You got a lot of nerve, to wanna serve my curves
My 36D, 36 hips
The way I shoot the gift, I swallow coke bottles
And you would swear it was Lil' Kim lips
Eh, I really like you baby
Do you know how to wife this lady?
Give me what I want, don't talk, don't touch
Unless you got a bank account that make my face blush
Now shush... in my bush
And I can give you what you want, make a whoosh
Just throw it, I'll show you how to push
Kinky sex, tie ropes around your wrist
Come on..
[Chorus]
[Outro: Missy Elliott]
Come on... hah... oh..
Come on... hah... oh... aha-ha
Oh... aha-ha... whoo!
Come on!

Yo
Aiyyo I'm lost underwater
I see a pink dog with a crystal handle, so I keep swimmin
Amazed that I'm not drownin
Butterflies took control when I arrived, I opened the door
No I knocked first, I'm not on my turf
I seen a ray of lights that resemble live fireworks
Some mermaids with Halle Berry haircuts flashin they tail
Like follow me now, don't be afraid
I'ma show you where all the djinns and spirits pray
If you scared to face this life you shouldn't stay
So I kept on swimmin, grabbed on to her fin to help me out
As we got close I seen the boat all shot up with his anchor out
Then she asked me politely what I'm thinkin about
I said nuttin - she said nuttin leaves nuttin
If you fill me up bet this'll bring that out
I seen rubies, diamonds, smothered under octopus
Jellyfish sharks soar, aquaproof pocketbook
Pearls on the mermaid girls
Gucci belts that they rock for no reason from a different world
Up ahead lies Noah's Ark, but that's waves away
And way to the right, that's one of our bangin spas
She quoted I took notice, Spongebob in the Bentley Coupe
Bangin the Isleys, he slow backed up
Then he passed me swoop, seen his chick eyein me hard
He got vexed and smacked his boo
Took off, continued my travels
Seen a rock from the Titanic
Lookin fat and nah it wasn't damaged
Then I seen somethin real big, sky blue and gold
with whitewalls, behind a large city
That was lost before Christ walked the walk
upon the waters that's so bright
Everytime we got close the mermaid held on tight
All I heard was ""Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar""
""Bismillah ar-Rahman, ar-Raheem, Allah screamed""
That we heard from afar, everyone selat
And the world's banginest minds got crowded in
With life that I can't explain
They said sir yes I'm glad you came, greeted me with Qu'rans and Torahs
Prayed after that we said amen

verse one: nas
through the lights cameras and action, glamour glitters and gold
i unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
when i'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
to conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
trick my wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son
smoke a gold leaf i hold heat, nonchalantly
i'm grungy, but things i do is real it never haunts me
while, funny style niggaz roll in the pile
rooster heads profile on a bus to riker's isle
holdin weed inside they pussy with they minds on the
pretty things in life, props is a true thug's wife
it's like a cycle, niggaz come home, some'll go in
do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
from the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual
verse two: raekwon the chef
perhaps bullets bust niggaz discuss mad money
true lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
pyrex pots, we break, fiends lickin plates
in the building niggaz building, like little children starin
them older niggaz aint carin
sirens circlin fiends are lurkin in your baggage
oh, one's gone now, what, smack him in his cabbage
in the woodwork, crack cells bubble like woolworth's
in the projects, richest niggaz rockin all the real worth
police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
tradin in they lexus' gs's sendin messages
two and two makes four, cristal's crazily pour
gun wars my crew phantom like swords
verse three: ghostface killer
with the green leathers, hunded pound snakes and cakes
fiends found in lakes, jeolously jakes we shake
what i strive for is what i live for
infatuated by material things, and it's wild like for war
like somewhere over the rainbow, i see a big pot of gold
future stacks yo i hold
thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
don't keep jack in my lap, don't wanna see tupac
got two spots, a new lot, flooded with rocks
shoot-outs making me hot, crooked cops bad tony and the ball drop
in the now, i'm bangin niggaz for slide time
hurry up duke i'm next, show em mine
and what the fuck is you looking at?
by the way young blood, hit me off with that green bay hat
watch your back inside the hall, new niggaz slide through
like doors yo, you're starin in the mess hall
your adrenaline runs, cigarette niggas be swindlin
new jacks surrenderin, come home not rememberin
made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
lookin gay in the yard, and you got hurt
flashbacks, of the day room, mop ringer style
your faggot ass got bashed tryin to turn the dial
you told your boo you was whylin
once you heard wu, out of the blue, your family's from shaolin
high class cooks, throw on vestes out of phone books
infirmary niggas are screaming, ""i got drugs!""
sharpen toothbrushes 190 mixed with baby oil and shit
your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
well i'ma end this with a big red cherry on top

Get the mic on
I don't know what happened, son
I just lost my mind, son
It's like I wasn't strong, G, I couldn't hold it when I seen it
A nigga flesh on me, I can't really-- I couldn't hold it, G
I don't know, I'mma, listen, no I went like this, nigga
Chorus
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say...
It was him, the cornerstore and a buttered roll
The shit dropped when I gave him two stomach holes
One to the face, he fell sideways
I was up close, so part of his nose was stuck to my padres
Standin' over him shakin', kid, screamin'
He slapped my girl, that's the reason why I was f'in to lean 'im
Everything got real slow, I ain't hear shit, my word
At least 40 seconds, I stay dead stiff
I pound him with the gun out, Big Din came, opened my hand
Removed the gun and the 16 spun out
He floored past 90 on the BQE
I threw up all on his door, splashed his Gucci seats
I couldn't speak, I'm in a state of shock
About now there should be yellow tape on the block, a raid at my spot
Hey, yo, I feel a li'l bugged out, insane, I lost my mind
People tellin' me, Ghost, you actin' mad strange
Chorus
See what I'm sayin'?  I don't know, I just don't feel right
Havin' flashbacks, bugged out, man, knahmean?
Nah, I don't wanna go to the clinic, I don't want the hospital, son
You know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man, y'knahmean?
My face feels numb, son
Chorus
Flashbacks to me blowin' his brains out
All I remember's my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out
Oxy cleans wheat 'round the chest area
Righthand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat
And my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee
But I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach
On the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York
'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk
Manhunt, police searches, swat ran in my crib
Battering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids
Now my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz
She paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks 'cause of these pigs
Plus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me
I told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me
I'll never eat up out a garbage can
I'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight
But I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off
Cops, connects, I don't give a fuck, they gon' feel that Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert
They gon' feel that Bulldog, y'knahmean?  I don't give a fuck
Don't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean?
If I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it
Yo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin'
Y'all niggaz'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you
Motherfuckers, fuck ya'll niggaz, I ain't goin' crazy
Sleepin' on couches and shit... I'm goin' back outside, fuck ya'll niggaz, man
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say
I know my Mother's worried about me
'Cause they might have to put me away at any time
'Cause when my baby packed up her clothes and left me
She oh!  I believe she took my mind...

[Intro: Ghostface]
Yeah you are now listening to the sounds of Ghost Radio
777 FM, we in God dimension
Sponsored by Stark Enterprise
Shout out to everybody on Staten Island
Don't touch that dial...
Ay yo, ay yo, my name's on your roster kid, I mean business
Big elevators mean big businesses
Sleeves rolled up around five, I, loosen my tie
Rough day though the stock was high
Plus I'm hungry, move like the boss of the joint
I know it don't mean nothing 'cuz I brought the joint
But still, realer hits, card dealin' shits
Bass lips, murder topics, niggas ain't shit
So what, I had a rough day?
That's right, and if y'all don't like it
then motherfuck, ya'll is Ghost in da house!
Make noise if it's C.R.E.A.M. in da house!
Aww shit now, fly coffee tables, haircuts dust
Money this long, you wish you could roll with us
Supersoak us, your bitch chose us
Be sure to stay away from friends you can't trust
[Tekitha (Ghostface)]
It's been so long
(Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Since he had a true friend
(That's right, that's right)
True friends are sure hard to come by
(Uh-huh)
But then again
His loyalties lie within
Always kept his head to the sky
And they can't see... no n-n-no-no
(Check it..I want all y'all...remember this? Yo...c'mon, c'mon)
They can't see him walking through the darkness... no-n-n-no-no

They can't see him walking through the darkness
[Ghostface]
Yo, yo, yo, the new President America
Flash money, act funny
Party, ride the bubbly
Goons and thugs, double hennessey
One shot to the nose, double energy
I don wallabees, fucking remember me
Guess who's back? The W embassy!
Even in the dark we electricity, rap celebrities for the longevity
Staten and Manhattan, that's all liberty
B.E.T, MTV always big on me
That I rock coliseums, cop a drop BM
Drunk throw his dick out on stage, I gotta see 'im
[Then he sung:]
Ha! Let's get druuunnnnk! Ha!
Let's get drunk and hiiiiiiiIIIIIIGH yeahhhh!

Yo, you know what y'all...
Make me wan' pop sumthin', no champagne
Two-five on me, weed and crack stalk me
Bitch motherfucker tried to get a rep' off me
Leave him there, never know, get him off me
I remember days when we just fucked bitches
Bought a lot of clothes and just played the ave.
Now we rap niggas with a lot of wardrobes
and if we want a nigga dead we pay the cash
I ain't tryin to waste my career on y'all
Even scuffle with y'all, waste gear on y'all
But if I gotta go out, you know I'ma show out
You gon' fuck around and get your whole back blown out
I remember on the Island, can't tone out
The mess hall crawler, about to zone out
Dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out
We just dumb motherfuckers with our microphone out

See.. see.. see me
I roll with Ghost and cats that carry they toast and
make the post and from pagin, sin astasian
When it's time to bust off them things, it ain't a game man
We rocked out own diamond rings, see them 'Bling, Bling'
Got big boy toys, Porsche, Sixes
Dime bitches, told y'all before we import those
Jury stay froze, court cases get closed
Niggas hate Nino cuz how fast I roast them
Like George Jefferson and em, steppin on em
The headline read, ""Starks had the weapon on em""
The best, what y'all expect? He a vet
Plus the best, now tell me how we gon' foul
when we dealin with 'Supreme Clientele'

From Riker's Island to the Camay Island
We thugs like, life is the same challenge
Do the knowledge, recognize your talent
And if you live the streets, you better stay silent

Yo, spotted at a mirage, Ghostface walked by groupies
Minkal monk stars, I come in cat, invades Mars
Hallyed at a sanctuary, first dent placed upon entry
Fainted when the book mentioned me
Keep ballin, new systems, high sciences
Drop that, Ghost listenin, the track sizzlin
Angelica, Judey Plum for bitches, Goines king of the century
Best sellers, but niggas stay together
Posted up trucks, leanin on the Benz
Cinemax smile shot in thrity-five lens
You program, broke bottles of Dom
Seven inch bangles, back breakers
I'm a dope feed, look at my art, Popeye strength
Rap with a British accent, Gucci clothes
Dennis Coles in the latest fashions
Blow backs in, flip raps like fourty-eight bundles
Dinner plates, deadly front gates, celeb Brian Gumble
[Hell Razah]
Interlapse this in like Deniro, words in your center earhole
Blocks of ice like Sub-Zero, we been right since day zero
Shatter your soul like glass windows
Turn verses to nymphos, pop these hollows at fake cats in a Tahoe
Wild out, throw your liquor bottles at hood rats to the richest models
We conversate like Christ and the twelve apostles
Livin life without you, can't count you as great men
Murderers in the state pen', bein caged in
The wage is a sin, before they read up they pop our tape in
You ain't gotta tuck you chain in cuz here we want the head of Satan

Or sent back, meaning whole life fade to black
I'm looking in the half of right and roll tight
fool me once but can't fool me twice, I'm 25
To life on this mic device ain't nothing nice
a mixture of long wild rice and no spice
Inflicted, rap addicted, track I stick it, flip it
daddy long dick-ed, slide
A little bit beyond twisted, mind in stitches
You thought weak but meant wicked
Niggas choke off my second hand smoke lifted
everyday is like my birthday I'm mad gifted, dead calm
Hit me with the eighteen bronze, buddah palm
About to blow like Napalm, before your arm
Prepare for the warfare, or buy a share

Picture me snotty nose sittin on my aunt's lap
The kid like 5 or 6 shit I will curse back
I got it from the older folks sittin in the living room
everybody had cups stylistic song boom
but then came Darryl Mack lightin' all the reefer up
baby caught a contact I'm trying to tie my sneaker up
I'm missing all the loops strings going in the wrong holes
It feels like I'm wobbling, look at all these afros
Soon as I thought I was good the joke's on me
I heard a voice ""get in the room, I get angry""
Sting my feet catch a tantrum
spit, scream, fuck that
Momma shake me real hard, then get the big gat
That's called the belt help me as I yelled
I'm in the room like (panting)""huh, huh, huh"" with mad welps
ragged out, bad belt yes her presence was felt
Then get my black ass in the bed it's time crash out (crash out)

[Verse 2]
Despite the alcohol, I had a great old Mama
She famous for her slaps and to this day she's honored
But when I was a lil dude her son was a lil rude
I picked the peas off my plate and pour juice in her nigga food
Get beat, then I'd run and tell grandman ""mama hit me for no reason""
She whipped me hard when I finished eatin
and felt that belt stingin after I wet that bed
Hid my drawers and start cryin, when she felt that bed
Caught another when I told her those the fake pro-keds
In the corner weavin and screamin trying to block my head (ahHH!)
Nowadays kids don't get beat, they get big treats
Fresh pair of sneaks, punishments like have a ceas
Back then when friends and neighbors would bust that ass
and bring you back to your momma she got the switch in the stash
That's back to back beatings
Only went outside for free lunch with welts on my legs still leakin yo

Give this man a round of applause, he do it so well
Ladies and gents, ladies and gents...
Alright, alright, have a seat, have a seat...
Without further adiou, he needs no introduction
He is my co-host... Shawn Ripple!
(Alright, is this thing on? Eh, eh, sweetheart, come here
Got a hundred dollar bill tattooed on my cock
Heard you like to... blow money... hahaha)
It was amazing, I seen Robin Thicke and Robin Leech
Robin Williams, Robin Givens and Meryl Streep
A real award show, there's Kanye West
Pamela Anderson, and she brought both of them breasts
Paris Hilton and Lindsay, holding down Britney's skirt
No more free looks, you gotta put in work
To get a glimpse, seen Don Juan with all of his pimps
And they hoes on they side, sipping they four-fives
And Billy Dean...
Excuse me, have you seen Alicia Keys?
Tell her the limo's outside, she's bouncing with me
The Don, y'all rappers don't steal my ash trays
My coat hangers is diamonded out like my last gates
Superhead, gave the low scoop to Halle
She said, before Whitney, she was fucking with Bobby
Mos Def, The Roots, Common and Nelly
Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Three 6 Maf', yo, and she fucked O.J... word?

Word.  Man fuck that nigga
Fuck that crab, ass, bitch [Who the live niggaz youknowhatI'msayin?]
[You niggaz know how to shoot joints] (Put down the gun son)
[Elmira, Riker's Island, coming from Brownsville] (Put down the gun son)
Niggaz tried to front on my little sister (Put down the gun)
[YouknowhatI'msayin we represent youknowhatI'msayin?]
[YouknowhatI'msayin?  Big Tony Rhome, peace to my man Tony Rhome]
They tried to, tried to front on this (Put down the gun son)
[RZA respect youknowhatI'msayin? We keep it real]
Yeah, check it out y'all (put down the, put down the gun son)
[Put your guns down, throw your hands up]
It's on like that y'all word up, Iron Man comes back
[Represent, you niggaz gotta shoot joints]
Yo check it
Verse One: RZA
Put away your heaters, throw up your dick beaters
Accurate blows to his nose shut his eyes closed to a centimeter
Bitches on the fences wonderin what the fuck the suspense is
I land heavy uppercuts in the corner of the park fences
Knocked his mouthpiece front teeth got locked inside my knuckle
He grabbed the belt buckle, attempt to catch me with a couple
of low blows to the nuts, on ringside was as a giant du-els
Send your Barb for this fuckin jew On a Wire
He couldn't chessbox that's when he reached for his ahhs
Brother chopped me on the top of my knot, but he got stopped
When a twelve ounce bottle of Bartyle and James had him startled
A bitch threw it caught him in his head, at full throttle
He fell, the glass crashed, he wasn't saved by the bell
That was his ass black
So when it comes to physical combat
We can take it hand to hand or go beyond that
Do you want my gat to make the contact?
Retirin cats who lack the heart to fire back?
[We take all crabs overboard]
Chorus: Raekwon
Put down the gun son, son matter of fact, shoot the one on one
Hold it down, make sure the head, sure nuff don't hit the ground
Lampin on the handball courts, or the square, we can take it there
Settle it son, who the champion?
[It's like that, niggaz want to front, one more time?
I'ma show you like this. One on each side
This is it word up. We gonna lay you back
We gonna rest your back, you won't know how to act
When it come to bigger, showin and provin
Niggaz styles is wack] Who the champion?  Settle it son.
Verse Two: Ghostface Killer
Yo!
I had to run up on this King at Devine, for his shines
He saw the stash and caught my mailbox for eighty dimes
He saw me stashin, like a pipe-link for mega fiends
I held it down like the finger fly miraculous King
Peep through the heavy small get the camoflouge
Starks master in charge, pushin through ery buildin, sippin egg nog
Niggaz know my status God body carry big batters
Fiends know me for my blue bags, besides smackin crabs
and earnin mine, this bitch Sha cat, gotta get his back bent
What the hell just made him fuck with my intelligent?
Back to Polly and I heard some noise we pack a two twelve
There go Lord Shamel, faggot made a sale
He's sellin my shit, I should slap fire out his ass
Snap his bones in half and watch the stock market crash
I walked up on him, he had the nerve to say Peace God
Ain't nuttin Peace God, you stole it now we out in the streets
Take your shit off, nigga you soft, back up off
Youse a shady nigga, I'm a sever fig you with a gloss
I snuffed him, threw a crazy left and I cuffed him
Allah don't like ugly so I held back from bustin him
I passed the burn off, he caught me from the blind side
Tapped a nigga jaw, I shot my fifty-two style, and crazy raw
I had my ice on, tapped a few times, he started leakin
De King with the deadarm, Shamel fell to his knees and
He started wheezin, losin his breath from smokin trees and
I'm still breathin, bleedin because it's frontin season
Now I got that project belt, international/national
Worldwide, I let Shamel slide

That was the best fuckin I ever had.
That's because you been dealin with Dasheese
You gotta leave? Where you goin sugar?
I got business to take care of
[Ghostface]: No shit.
Shit that's my old man, shit!
Ya better go talk to him

[Ghostface]
Yo bitch I fucked your friend, yeah you stank hoe
I seen her on the elevator, honey grabbed my Kangol
She put me on to mega-shit, bout to slap the bitch
She shot crazy verbal, I leaned back like I'm rich
It took place late night on February 17th
Hands flooded like ink, my face on her magazine
Just got back from Honolulu, pockets stackin boucoup cash
Girlfriend sipped the Yoo-hoo and laughed, yo
While I was on tour, whore, you went to work
Quick fast, had a nigga dick in the dirt
You couldn't wait just to kidnap the bait of my sperm
Where's you at, hoe? 'Pinky house, she put in my perm'
That's all you ever said to me, thought that could hold me
Remember when I long-dicked you and broke your ovary?
You crab bitch, chickenhead hoe, eatin' heros
I'm the first nigga that had you watchin flicks by DeNiro
You gained crazy points, baby, just bein with God
Taught you how to eat the right foods, fast, and don't eat lard
I gave you earth lessons, I came to you as a blessin
You didn't do the knowledge what the God was manifestin
You sneaky fuck bitch, your ways and actions told it all
I fucked you while you was bleedin, held you down in malls
Sexually you worshipped my di-dick like a cross
I had you fiend out, broke out, for a month you fell off
You was my main shit, my peeps showed you love on the strength
You saw how I got down, the way I thought had you tranked
But you had to fuck this rasta-head ass nigga
I shoulda slapped ya but the Gods said chilllllllll
That's your wiz fault, god, handle that in the lab""
I'm wonderin how many times your hot ass got stabbed
You dumb bitch, horny hot fuck from out the mountains
Your clientele is low hoe, catch you next show, bro
I got jerked, gave away my pussy, that shit hurt
It feel like somebody died or shot your old Earth
But fuck it, I fucked you on a chair with three legs
Broken tables, had you screamin while you was bitin on my cables
Whistlin to the washing machine, I threw it on spin
If your pussy dry, spit on my dick and put it in
My dick's the bomb baby, marvelous hot steak
Plus I'm conceited Starks make the biggest so-called rape
I'm God, cipher divine love my pussy real fine
That means clean the FDS smell with a shine
Word up, respect that hoe

It's on..
[Cappa] Where your sparkle at kid?
Ryzarector..
[Break: Raekwon the Chef]
Yes the shit is raw, comin at your door
Start to scream out loud, Wu-Tang's back for more
Yes the hour's four, I told you before
Prepare for mic fights (and plus the cold war)
[Verse One: U-God]
This rhyme you digest through the RZA console
Ask why I slam nine diagram pole
Raekwon dropped the bomb, Hunchback, Norte Dame
Golden Arms is bronze, buddah palm hit Qu'ran
It blows extreme, mean stream be the theme
Supreme team, America's Cream Team, redeemed
Vidal Sassoon, chrome tones hear the moans of Al Capone
Gun POW to the dome
And split the bone, wig blown off the ledge
By the alledged, full-fledged, sledge RZA edge
One dose of my feroc(ious) handheld trigga cuts
Acapella spittin shell paralyzed when you get touched
And critical mic cords, hangin like umbilical
Cords, dope swords, five star general
Raw be the quote rap style sore throat
Through the fully operational, hand held tote mm-hmm
[Break: (first two lines)]
[Verse Two: Ghostface Killah]
More than a thousand times one, snatch up my styles get done
I hold a title, enhanced how my belt was won, check it
Slick majestic, broke mics are left infected
Germs start to spread through your crew, drew like an epic
You asked for it, shot up the jams like syringes
My technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
Masked Avenger, I appear to blow your ear like wind
With a freestyle, sharper than the Indian spear
So sit back and let the king explore
Describe me, the kid's nice and he holds swords
And his name, black attack's the nerve like migraines
With more games than beggars on trains, livid sharp pains
Poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't destroy this
You get ambushed, skate, try to avoid this
Side effects of, hot raps and hot tracks
A duffle bag full of guns son, dipped in black
My culture, glides and attacks just like a vulture
Ghostface in Madison Square is on your poster
[Break]
[Verse Three: Masta Killa]
Be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
That fills more body bags than apartments in projects
And as far as the coroners know
The autopsy show, it was a Shaolin blow
Put on by my family brought to the academy
of the Wu and learned how to
fuck up yo' anatomy, steadily, calm and deadly
Spatter-head lyrics I lick through your transmit
MC's submit to the will as I kill your
juvenile freestyle, civilize the men-tal
Devils worship this like an icon
Bear-huggin mics with the grips of a python
[Break]
[Verse Four: Cappadonna]
You heard of the rasp before but kept waitin
for the sun of song, I keep dancehalls strong
Beats never worthy of my cause, I prolong
Extravangza, time sits still
No propoganda, be wary of the skill
As I bring forth the music, make love to your eardrum
Dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
Lebanon Don, Malcolm X beat threat
CD massacre, murder to cassette
I blow the shop up, you ain't seen nuttin yet
One man ran, tryin to get away from it
Put your bifocal on, watch me a-cometh
into your chamber like Freddy enter dream
Discombumberate your technique and your scheme
Four course applause, like a black dat to dat
You're stuck on stupid like I'm stuck on the map
Nowhere to go except next show bro
Entertainin motherfuckers can't stop O
in battlin, you don't want me to start tattlin
All upon the stage cause y'all snakes keep rattlin
Bitch, you ain't got nothin on the rich
Every other day my whole dress code switch
So just in case you want to clock me like Sherry
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry
Can't get a nigga like Don dime a dozen
Even if I'm smoked out I can't be scoped out
I'm too ill, I represent Park Hill
See my face on the twenty dollar bill
Cash it in, and get ten dollars back
The fat LP with Cappachino on the wax
Pass it in your think, put valve up to twelve
Put all the other LP's back on the shelf
And smoke a blunt, and dial 9-1-7
1-6-0-4-9-3-11
And you could get long dick hip-hop affection
I damage any MC who step in my direction
I'm Staten Island's best son fuck what you heard
Niggaz still talkin that shit is absurd
My repotoire, is U.S.S.R.
P.L.O. style got thrown out the car
and ran over, by the Method Man jeep
Divine can't define my style is so deep
like pussy, my low cut fade stay bushy
like a porcupine, I part backs like a spine
Cut you like a blunt and reconstruct your design
I know you want to diss me, but I can read your mind
Cuz you weak in the knees, like SWV
Tryin to get a title like Wu Killa Bee
Kid change your habit, you know I'm friends with the Abbott
Me and RZA ridin name printed in the tablet
under vets, we paid our debts for mad years
Hibernate the sound, and now we out like beers
and blunt power, born physically power speakin
The truth in the song be the pro-black teachin

I heard the phone ring, ding, ding
Who this? 'Vine yo..
Wise guy killed last night by the Tracks,
It was the same who our niggas teeth up
Sent 'em back, we shoulda thrilled a long time ago
We went this recording, now we owe
The devil slit trough, without an intro
Yo 'Vine, it can't be!
Wise guest-starring me
Can it be, we both got hit
God legendary, he and General
He survived A-dog,
Hard to even picture god eaten by gray dogs
He stayed in his world
And he sidely sweard
To tell the truth, that DeVon was like
""Your out of cure boo""
Wisegod Allah, warrior
XY chromosome, sat heavy on the throne
Touched something for you
Ya stupid fail niggas fucked up
Becouse bitches is talking
They living, i'm twisting
You alleybag
You killed my man, you killed my man
And you sent him back
After this day, watch your hats
Slugs flying everywhere,
You could smell heaven in the air
You can never get the god, yeah
Now i'm cypher,
You've been driving off the same battery
We had, back in '91 that got you hyper
God been beautiful, god been great
God fed you, you died but we survived that day
You killed your king, Rakeem Allah
Gave him his life, he was your offspring
Camouflage dog, days was green
One righteous man fought for his right, gods pupil
Yo, that's my fam, we snatch me out of big head van
We tought you how to get gain, from sayin' ""peace god""
As long we translate Allah's tounge, spit the language hard
Alley thoughts, identical twin
My alias gasanate, the days close,
The days close, how'd you know!
Once the sun comes out and the rain is gone..
I know I'm gonna see, a better day
I know I think I'm crying, becouse of you
I'm crying, don't want you to see me cry
Love you Wise, love you Wise, love you Wise!

I wanna go outside, in the rain...
It may sound crazy, it may sound crazy
But I wanna go outside, in the rain...

Yo, too advanced, Digi' stance, made the CD enhanced
I move with the speed and strength of ants
Identical in form with the Beez they swarm
Hold up the cold current appear warm
My first verbal brawl, started on some yes yes y'all
to the beat y'all, break your windshield, your jeep stall
Mr. Traffic, dumbin shit, from ecclesiastic
Cashier, holdin out, fine, cut off the plastic
See the logo? A monument in hip-hop
Carved out, in the giant landscape, of broken rocks
Whether heard in herb spots, jukebox or malt shops
Uncut live, drop eighty-five, in one shot
Spotlight hits the metal mic, majority stare
Heard the Wu snare, while my iris cut down the glare
Walk a road the great length you find too long to measure
My Clan a make me rhyme like D. Banner under pressure
No surprise, double disc touched five
Those elements, kept environments colonized
with the high flyin death-defyin flow like the Rebel
Right there, but you're one light year, from my level
[Ghostface]
Uh-huh.. yeah.. yo.. check it.. yo..
Bottles goin off in the church, we broke the wine
slapped the pastor, didn't know Pop had asthma
He pulled out his blue bible, change fell out his coat
Three condoms, two dice, one bag of dope
Oooh! Rev. ain't right, his church ain't right
Deacon is a pimp, tell by his eyes
Mrs. Parks said, ""Brother Starks, meet you at the numbers spot
Heard you got red tops out, and I want a lot""
Shirley fainted dead on the spot
Two ushers slipped eighty dollars right out the pot
Oh shit!

Egyptian, brown skin brown suede Timbs
Masqueradin X-rated throw blades, all occasions
Round nozzle touchdown, Haagen-Daas gobbles White House
Gucci flag on the roof, call us rock groups
Mere intelligent, buy Nieman Marc' it out
No doubt, all we saw he bought, Lori mom's all blow
was simple, blamp instrumentals run camps the stamps get you
The way we lamp, fans come and get you
Play, fullback strapped like a fuck, war at
the black, Carlo Gambino's stash house in Hackensack
Pack capsules, Green Bay 'em lay 'em down like wax do
It's all actual we build, like Crash Crew
Coconut, incense, one sentence, aiyyo
Control the holy flinch hit this, new whips
Roman numerals, sun splash them niggaz like, Tango and Cash
Alcatraz cats roll out fast..

Wu thousand nuthin but hardcore
We tryin to get land riches and more
Ghost put me on to it
We just do it, floss or whatever
Take care of the business, there's too many roughnecks
Give two of these to Flex, tell him it's real rap like Ghost
Had to beat niggaz with toast
Clubs V.I. clientele we lay it down flat
Poot out on y'all kid, now where your mans at?
Fakin the real like, ""Damn I can't stand Cappa'""
Then my wardrobe flooded the next chapter
Y'all heard about us like we heard about you
Bless the mic with reality, hit you with the virtue
Calm down not tryin to hurt you, burst through

Put the barrel by his face, blast one by his eardrum

Screamin like a bitch, kicks to your face
Shots to the body that shake like the bass
I'm Ghostfaced up, military style down
Nuff ammunitions of rounds across the chest

Skip to the intro, rap through po'
Smashed a fresh ball of wax ceasar
Flashy penthouse that overlooks the vista
Wally Moc' have tie, swimmin trunks
Three chunks of ice sit in Johnny Walker for advice
Catch the moment, fundraiser at will, work with the homeless
Polish diamond edge, Flintstone shit, sealed in a comb pick
carefully, swing the B seven series Christmas lights
too bright Ghost is comin y'all fix the mirrors
Relax like pudding, confidence strangle my man couldn't
Exile he no longer in the hood

Before you put ya hands on the wall, empty ya pockets
Fix ya face, this a robbery, nigga, respect the juks
Stop shaking, you making me nervous, I know that you shook

Move, turn ya head around, nigga, you better not look
Stacks, you hiding from Tone? I'll shake, rattle ya bones
You killed him! Nah, hit him with the back of the fucking chrome
In the dark, yo, I do this alone
That's the reason why I don't shake hands, in case I gave you a phone

Shorty's strapped with the mac inside her pocket book
Blowing all lots of kush
Dark tints on the V so the D's can't spot the crooks
Just throw ya hands in the sky, don't try to stop the juks
Face down, lay on the ground, no sudden moves
Yo, then, take off his Timbs and get the work out his shoes
Rip off the pockets out his shoes, make sure he come out his used
I hear sirens, plus the cameras is watching, it's time to move
If you lolly-gagging, word to mama, I'll body bag 'im
Leave his frame riddled with holes, looking like Gotti had 'im
Bragging, juked, in the wagon, laughing
We slid a few blocks down, this kid was frozen
With stones so we decided to yapp 'im
I put the tool in his mouth, said ""You don't want the action

Hunt you down, holding the next man's stacks

Sweet reunion, Jamaica and Spain
We're like how we we're again
I'm in the tub, you're on the sink
Lick your lips, as I soak my feet
Yo, get the bath and body works, pumping your spice creams
Together like Cheech and Chong, we make nice dreams
Fight scenes, I take the good with the bad
Cuz you give the best brains that I ever had and
Anything worth having is hard to keep
I love you like my coffee so hot and so sweet
So let's, stick it out, so we never regret it
I could forgive the past, but I never forget it

Got to forgive the past, but I never forget it
