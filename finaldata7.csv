And makin family plans - say it (make love to me)

She got a nigga whipped, down to ya fingertips
Tryin that freaky shit - what? (fuck, meee!)
Turn on some Babyface, just for your lady's sake

Your heart's a beating drum - say it (make love to me)
You better not of came, she want to feel the pain
Then hear her scream your name - what? (fuck, meee!)
Follow this DICK-tionary, you're both some visionaries

You wanna tell the world, cause she's your favorite girl
Your diamond and your pearl - say it (make love to me)
Nobody has to know, just keep it on the low

Nothin but fights and fussin, plus there's a lot of cussin

Y'all do that BAD stuff, she like it rammed up
Ropes and HANDCUFFS - what? (fuck, meee!)

I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna move from the bed down, to the down to the, to the floor
I wanna ah-ah, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But I got to kn-kn-kn-know what's your fan-ta-sy
[Trina]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

I wanna uh-uh, you make it so good I don't wanna leave
But you gotta let let me know know what's your fanta-ta-sies
[Trina] (Ludacris)
You know what I need
Somebody that who can come li-li-lick the clit
(Alright)
And a nigga who ain't thinking 'bout a Trina LP
And I'll make him go and get my shit
We can go from a fly ass jetta to a Coupe De Ville
Hotel tally ho or the Beverly Hill
A real nigga not the run of the mill
To come and spank me and make me shoot to kill
From the kitchen then you can move me
To the jaccuzzi and out the booty
Come and do your duty
Me and fat dick Ludacris making us a movie
Butt naked in a bed of cash
Make tough stuff stutter when I shake my ass
Damn she back, I though she a thing of the past
Cause I'm a bad bitch and I'm off the glass (Okay)
Having sex in little jets menage'tois
Getting buck wild no matter where we are
Indie 500 in the back of the car
In a dark ass club on the back of a bar
Never want, never ever wanna leave
Work for me like league over seas
I want a man to fulfill my needs
To keep my body trembling and buckle my knees
[Ludacris]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

I wanna do in the canopy
I wanna do it where your girl gon see and get mad at me
I want a nigga that'll grab the weave
And turn my eyes Chinese
Tell me baby can you handle me?
I wanna do it all in your mouth
Then I'll pull the ass out
Make you bounce till you pass out
Or we can cut up in the grass
And give the neighbors a flash
Can you tell me who the bad motherfucker now?
Said I wanna take-ta-take-take a nigga back to the crib
And I wanna do, do all the things that I never did
Like I up on the top-to-top-top of the projects getting head
Or you can find me in a dro-drop-drop-drop on dubs in the candy red
I like a nigga when he face down, mouth wide
Polo down with them blades on the ride
Give me a pound with the case on the side
But it's okay I'm gon break something tonight
Oh see get on your knees
And I'll show you what's my fantasy
Like up in the coupe, coupe
Tell your bitch she ain't gotta be mad at me

You gotta li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
Then you gotta su-suck the pussy while I sit on your dick
And I wanna talk some shit while I feel it get stiff
And then ruba-dub on my tits while I nut on your lips nigga
I'm a BK bitch, love to ride dick
Ass in his face, cock spread out
Nigga uptown, nigga down south
Same ol' shit, foot's in his mouth
F-O-X call me rough sex
Especially when a bitch get right on the X
Get it, right on X
Fuck him, check right to the next
Bitches go right, Fox right to the left
Nigga can't fuck, burner on his chest
36 D's, Prada on the breats
Baddest, send him home with na na on his breath
What? How you think a bitch got my rep?
3 Mills, still BK to the death
Still don't give a fuck
Still pose naked
Still specialize on sittin' on niggas faces
Pop magnum's by the cases
X5 Benz still spend big faces
Big frown, brown, hold first places
You know what you can do nigga?
You can li li li lick me from my ass to my clit
And ruba-dub up on my tits while I nu-nut on your lips, fucka
[Ludacris]
I wanna li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes

Ooooh noooo
I caught him with a blow to the chest
Ooooh noooo
My hollow put a hole in his vest
Ooooh noooo
Im bout to send two to his dome
Cry babies go hoooome
I got people scared as fuck like when condoms break
Or how your heart deals with eatin 80 pounds a steak
So put your belly on the plate and watch your weight
You frosted like a flake and Ludacris feels GRRRREAT!
who one come face me face come one who
and women give me face til they face turn blue
they can't breathe dick to mouth recisitation
a tight squeeze but it stops the lengthy conversations
I play stations, jump cops and lose agents
I'm doctor love, I close curtains and fuck patients
When I kick and rip and flip indespinsable rhymes
My black ass is so hungry, I'll take a bite outta crime
And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if i choke
neighbors call the fire station off the blunt that I smoke
you see I crush cowards, funerals, I'll send flowers
and I'm on the overpass flick pennies in rush hour
you see im ambidextrious, i slap ass with both hands
delete your first  ____ but i'll save the last dance
i just bought some new guns my momma said it aint worth it,
but im at the shooting range just cause practice makes perfect
bulls-eye i stunt growth and stop lives
and you run with niggaz that's more chicken than pot pie *chicken noises*
im shaking your tail feathers, i got big balls, ima sack king
like chris webber
luda take ya back to duck hunt and double dribble
when niggaz sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickles
my cars got big tvs and satelittes
i got a wheel of fortune cause i flip o's like vanna white
and the survey says.. kill a motherfucker now, could it be off with his head?
or shoot of motherfucker now, ground round
ground chuck and ground beef
bullets gather round and shoot rounds around teeth??
Chorus
i kick niggaz in they ass, we boot em like laptops
and they wouldn't even box if I gave them a flat top
you punks pucker and pout, bicker and babble,
now they all lost for words like i beat em in scrabble
you see I'm from a small town called fresh off a cop's ass
where mister head potatoes a skin to get mashed
i smell puss from fifty yards
yall not playing with full decks as if i jacked out the jacks and left fifty cards
catch me in vegas, spinning the green
i'll ?re? up with more chips than a vending machine
then you can
catch me in rome macking some broads and stickin em
and you'll be at home picking yo boogers and flickin em
a drug dealers dream, im so fresh and im so clean
im a grown ass man and yall sweeter than sixteen
so go and kick rocks beyond, you're just rookies
headin downstairs to get you some milk and cookies

We rollin on 20's with the top back
So much money you can't stop that
I got my twin glock .40's cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin on 20's with the top back
So much money you can't stop that
Now where'd you get that platinum chain wit them diamonds in it
And where'd you get that matchin Benz with them windows tinted
Who them girls you be with when you be ridin through
Man i ain't got nothin to prove i payed my dues breakin the rules
and shake fools while im takin' a cruise
Tell me who's your weed man and how do you smoke so good?
You's a supastar boy, why you still up in the hood?
What in the world is in that bag whatchu got in that bag?
A couple of cans of whoop ass you did a good ass job of just eyin' me spyin' me
I got my twin glock .40's cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin on 20's with the top back
So much money you can't stop that
I got my twin glock .40's cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin on 20's with the top back
So much money you can't stop that
Man that car don't come out until next year where the fuck did you get it
Thats eighty-thousand bucks gone where the fuck did you spend it
You must have eyes on yo back cuz you got money to the ceiling
And the bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin the better i'm feelin,
The more that i'm chillin, winnin, drillin and killin the feelin
Now whos that fuckin naked cook fixing three course meals
Gettin goose bumps when her body tap them six inch heels
What in the world is in that room whatchu got in that room
A couple of gats a couple of knives, a couple of rats a couple of wives
Now it's time to choose
I got my twin glock .40's cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin on 20's with the top back
So much money you can't stop that
I got my twin glock .40's cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin on 20's with the top back
So much money you can't stop that
Are you custom made custom paid or are you just custom fitted
Playstation 2 up in the ride and is that Lorenzo kitted?
Is that your wife your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
You take a pick while i'm rubbin the hips touchin the lips
To the top of the dick and then WHOOOOO
Now tell me who's your house keeper and whatchu keep in your house?
What about diamonds and gold, is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case whatchu got in that case?
Get up out my face you can't relate waitin' to take place at a similar pace
So shake shake it
I got my twin glock .40's cocked back
Me and my homies so drop that
We rollin on 20's with the top back

Get out my business, my biznazz
Stay the fuck up out my biznazz
Cuz these niggas are all up in my shit and

Upside ya motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in, ""Ahhh girrlll"", they'll be mo' dead
Causin' confusion, Disturbin Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we runnin' the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and golddiggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? NO NIGGA!
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the FUCK outta my way

BITCH! Watch out, watch out, watch out

You see them headlights? You hear that fuckin' crowd?
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage, knock the curtains down

Young and successful - a sex symbol

Hold up wait up, shorty
""Oh ah wazzzahh, gettin' my dick sucked, what are yoouu doin'?""

But i'ma tell ya like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

Bring it, get 'em
Too bad I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump punk, I'll be right back
We buyin' bars out, showin' scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the pills cuz we poppin' tonight
Beat the shit outta security, for stoppin' the fight
I got a fifth of the remy, fuck the Belve and 'cris
I'm sellin' shit up in the club like I work in the bitch
Fuck the dress code, it's street clothes, we all street niggaz
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggaz
I'm from the Dec, tryin' to disrespect D.T.P.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the V.I.P.
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in your body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
All you faggot motherfuckers make way for 2-0
So...

You about to catch a cold, STAY THE FUCK AROUND FROM ME
Ya peeps talkin 'bout what kinda shits he on
You disappear like ""POOF, BITCH BE GONE""
You think twelve gon catch me, GIMMIE A BREAK
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimmie some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof. wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, +Golden Grain+ on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride

Let's take it to the streets cuz I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I LOVE TO PARK IT
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the petal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE
TV in the middle of my STEERING WHEEL
It's my car's birthday so we BLOWIN THEM CANDLES
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
and when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
Cuz the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a FUCKIN BIRD
And the fools, we gon CLOCK ONE and we'll POP ONE
Cuz my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun

You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL

BOY whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
If anybody talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'M gon do? ACT A FOOL
[Verse 3]
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is TIPSY
Off the off ramp doin about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin and we startin SHIT
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire cuz we stomped you out
and yeah, we blow trees and bees, that's fantastic
So gulls hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a +Change of Heart+
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW THIS WHOLE SHIT UP TO SMITHEREENS
[Chorus]
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon do? ACT A FOOL
MAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEMS

Tell me what you gonna do? Act a fool
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me what you gonna do? Act a fool
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Verse 2
Let's take it to the street cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in my trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NAS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I roll up to da club, I get all the affection
Cause the women love the paintin they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what you heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon clock one and we'll pop one
Cause my folk ridin' shotgun with a shotgun
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Now them girls up the block still running their mouth
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
If anyone talk bad about the dirty south
Tell me what I'm gonna do? Act a fool
Verse 3
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the street still smokin'
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off ramp doin' 'bout 150
Rollin' through East Pernium, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a 5 to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' some shit
I even got a trailer hitched with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and bees that's fantastic
So girls hold ya weaves while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like Lil' John Q and get a change of heart
It's 1 mission, 2 clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and steams
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
Catch a man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies whatcha gonna do? Act a fool
If the bottles all gone and your eyes are red
Boy whatcha gonna do? Act a fool

And get some balance like a bike without the kickstand
I think I changed the definition of a hit man
Cuz I could really give a fuck about that bitch man, c'mon!
We puttin holes in your residence
And lose anybody for the right president
We thugged out street niggaz with intelligence
So all that bullshit you yappin is irrelevant
Oh yeah, I represent the Dirty Southside

You be in jail still runnin it on the outside
Thank not then won't ya open up ya mouth riiiight, but who cares?

It's some respectable ladies and there some freak hoes
I know killers that go to church up in they street clothes
You'll end up missin more than Shaq when shootin free throws
They packin and bout to open up the dope spot
My neighborhood is stoppin cars like a roadblock
They movin' weight like Atlanta was movin boat rock
And catchin ums like seeun Muslims eatin pork chops - never happen
And meanwhile I been thinkin man
Niggaz been slangin tapes like they slangin 'caine
Cuz in the hood its gettin ugly like orangutang
So if you tryin to stop the hustle get the dangalang
Okay, we tryin to make our own White House
Paint it black and start yellin our fuckin pipes out
You try to tackle some players and you'll get psyched out
They can't fuck with us niggaz you think they dyked out, so don't play
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Disturbin The Peace, we do that funky shit
Hey, what can I say? We got a monkey clique
See Dre'll throw on them shades, and make that funky shit
And keep y'all women away if they got funky clit
Understand, we got that dough and it get rolled up
You pay the price and still we got the block sold up
Aint nothin nice a full house don't make you fold up
You full of heist and try to jet and I'm like -
hold up, god damn - I need to say it on a megaphone
And tell your sister get the fuck up off the telephone
These fools is tickin me off like fifty metronome
I'm takin all of ya money just call me Pebbletone!
Alright? I got the pistol and the safe key
You betta tell your bitch to follow you to safety
How dare you wanna be heroes and chase me
It's Ludacris wont leave no evidence to trace me, you know why?
[Chorus]
Funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit oh
Do that funky shit uh
Do that funky shit uh

I never used to snore in my sleep 'til this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
But bein broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin that I flop? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
In New York I buy clothing, in Cali I get green
In Atlanta I get sleep, in Texas I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin for sixteens
Try 80, want a discount? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
See in just six months I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggaz hate givin me props cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
[Chorus 2X: Ludacris]
If you mad I'm on top, then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road, then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk wish me wrong
But after your three wishes - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

It's time to saddle up the Tontos cause I'm the Lone Ranger
I eat dinner with Jews but don't talk to strangers

If you ever think of stoppin me - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I'm a hustler by nature but criminal by law
Any charges set against me, chunk it up and stand tall
Next year I'm lookin in to buyin Greenbriar Mall
You probably own a lot of property! BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
C'mon and take a look, he's got gigantic balls
Plus his money keeps flowin like Niagara Falls
We all know Jesus saves and Ludacris withdraws
I'm 'bout to go on vacation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'ma throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words

Pepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

[Ludacris]
My black people show me love when I'm up on the block
And Latinos always waitin for my CD's to drop
White people love the flow, they say, ""Dude, you fuckin rock!""
Yo' fans are my fans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
So find my album in the stores and look for the white steam
Rip it open, play it and yo' momma might scream
It's hard, other albums are softer than ice cream
Yo' scans are my scans, right? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Now Luda's throwin up A's, and I'm lightin up L's
Around the globe gettin paid, you home bitin yo' nails
DTP, the only label that practice fightin ourselves
We probably gettin on your nerves, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
I been eatin and gettin FAT while y'all dyin of hunger
I get drunk in the winter, stay high in the summer
Watch out, my album's puttin up McDonald's numbers
You over 6 million served, huh? BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!

Cause I'm that crazy nigga Luda

And I'm steady smoking buddah

Evil that'll bend you when I get you
I'ma sit you down
Then take it to the mental and essential and clown
Every chance I get
Bitch I'm hit
Not by no bullet or no pellet
But the smoke from the can-i-bis shit
I might just be too high
Then I put my middle finger up when I'm ridin' by
And say hi to plenty liquors and I know it's a sin
And if ya tell me stop drinking I'll just do it again
So when I get old I'ma rock, roll, shake, and shiver
With some blacked out lungs and a fucked up liver

Ey yo I do this for bluntheads and whinos

Doublin' dough 24-7

Runnin' wit 2 strike felons
And I pack 4-4's like Hank Aaron
Then'll smoke a L
Bust shells
And dare ya to tell
Walk up in the club
Pretty thug
Fucked up off head shots
Sippin' Courvousier watchin' hoes drop it like it's hot
Shaking tits and twats
Placing big face 20's and cock
Loading clips and glocks
Knowing we got the haters hot
The ballin' don't stop
Just drop more G's on drink and drugs
Live it up young nigga cause it's gon' catch up

Now wit the help of Hen and Coke
I grab my pen and pad and wrote
Something that I knew was dope
And represent for my kinfolk
Pimp a hoe until she broke
Wit mo lines than chopped coke
Ey yo it's 2-0 I'm Eastside's King
But I'm a writer with a twist of Amaretta
My shit even come out better
Grab a blunt put it together
What a nigga really need
Run up in the club and blow a motherfucker till he bleed
Could it be an Icehouse put his lights out
Or the club get closed out
If it's hoes out I show out
Call Tyheed get dro'd out
There's no doubt I love my life
Love the light
Love to write
Love the mic
So take a drag
Grab a bag and match up
Hennessey and bad weed
Believe me it catch up

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
It's gonna get in ya, child of the night
.. and the hood rolls on
How do I begin to, do this shit right
.. get my hustle on
[Ludacris]
Look here!
Now I'm a man of many talents and a man of my word
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst
Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat
And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why am I Curious George?
Gotta keep my nose up outta thangs that ain't none of my biz
And just cause somethin looks don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
I got some questions for you Lord cause my mentality's hood
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
Oh but I feed at least a thousand stomachs and how I've done it
is from the ground up a hundred miles and runnin
Dodgin and duckin everybody tryin to hammer me down
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Can't tell me nothin still hungry as the day I began
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
And a, pad in my lap, didn't matter in fact
Me and my momma lived in one room, and what's badder than that
was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
Tryin to get in where I fit, streets givin me hell
But yet I give it right - back, so how you like - that
Continue doin wrong 'til I was on the right - track
Tell me 'bout heavy money I might give it a PUSH
But a, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Come on
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
No matter how much older we get man, we all still children at heart
We all make mistakes, it's all good
Now I've tried plenty of times to get rid of my bad habits
Livin life on the cuttin edge, takin a stab at it
And learnin from my mistakes, try not to make 'em twice
Just admittin when I'm wrong, tryin hard to make it right
And baby, nobody's perfect in this world of ours
There's plenty people gettin stitches in this world of scars
But over time, pray to God that he can heal your wounds
Try to love and love again until they seal your tomb
Cause life is short if you don't know this it'll pass you by
That's why my head is in the clouds tryin to pass the sky
Never blinkin for a minute, keep my eyes on my foes
They wanna catch me in the open, bring my life to a close
Meanwhile that's why I'm bringin so much life to my shows
I've seen smiles I'm makin changes turnin glitter to gold
Don't let these devils play you down or belittle your soul
Just be happy with yo'self and it's so simple to grow
Come on

And I got to make sure that I take care of my family
And it ain't no choices 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
And to my niggas on the block
On the grind and hustlin' tryin' to sell some rocks
You hear the voices say it's cold outside (It's cold outside)
I'm hiding out and smokin' herb
because my boss is getting on my motherfucking nerves
But I got to take it 'cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)

My mama told me just to save it for another day
But I got to make it cause it's cold outside (It's cold outside)

Man, I can hear that wind blowing
You say it don't get cold in CP
Well niggas it's been snowing
Even though some might disagree
When business is still slowing
Even if we subject to change
Come up out them diamonds and rings
Even all them dollars and change
Nigga we home-grown
And to those that couldn't take the pressure
Nigga they long gone
Skeet 25 lighters on dressers
Or you'll get zoned on
They be puttin' them bodies in bags
They be cuttin' them bodies on slabs
Then go to somebody and brag
Got to keep a straight face
Better keep inside with your know
Got to find a safe place
Better stay in silence or go
Or end up a waste case
Pick figure it's more stuff to do
Pick nigger it's more folks than you
Pick never come close to a clue
I put my life on it
Want to disrespect give me your neck
And I'll put a knife on it
Some say it's slippery when wet
But my Roll got ice on it
It's all about supply and demand
It's all about me buying some land
You folks just don't understand
That uh
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Man, I see the clouds coming
Y'all see a man on the moon walking
I see a crowd running
and the APD steadily talking
'Cause we done found something
And it's not as good as it seems
Oh I wish I could get some cream
And get up out of the hood with some dreams
I'm peepin' hard crimes
See the system's fucked up
And they givin' out some hard times
Heard one of these ???
And my people snortin' hard lines
Locked up and they didn't do a thang
Locked up because of the pressure and pain
Locked up because they wouldn't do the same
And I see the case close
I can't ask no questions, and it's over
'Cause they say so
I ain't learned no lessons, but these snitches
Better lay low
Or we gonna be chopping some heads
And we gonna be rocking some beds
And we gonna be dropping some eggs
We walk a long road
Trying to find the essence of self
But I picked the wrong clothes
'Do rag with a gat under my belt
'Cause life's throwing strong blows
But I keep a little hope and some dreams
And I try to stay focused and clean
But I got a little dope and some green
'Cause uh
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I can see them shamed faces
Man, y'all look at me like y'all grew up
In the same places
Scams and dirty work came up on
A day to day basis
Now they got to re-up and re-bag
And they got to re-up and re-slab
Then they got to be up and be bad
This game'll NEVER end
Excuse my French, but Goddammit
I got some clever friends
They might get set back by some wench
But that bitch'll never win
It's all about the way of the world
It's all about the way of them girls
It's all about them diamonds and pearls
We waiting too long
But the DEC and Southwest Atlanta
Is too strong
We might bring that soap out and wash up
And throw them suits on
Coming in the court with some pride
'Cause we ain't got nothing to hide
Just didn't know what laws to abide
I play the cards dealt
And I bought a full house and I watched
The woman's heart melt
See my mama's cooled out and she's crying
'Cause it's heart-felt
It's all about supply and demand
It's all about me buying some land

Thank you, king shit
Yeah motherfuckers! Welcome to the United States of America.
Time to roll out the red carpet on y'all bitch asses.
Hailin from the filthy, dirty South, where the Kings lay.
Ludacris; Disturbin' Tha Peace family. Recognize royalty
when you hear it. The throne has been taken, so kiss this
nigga's earring. Luda throw some grapes on these bitches!
[Ludacris]
These bitches throwin rose petals at my feet mayn!
They wanna spoil me, treatin me like royalty;
what I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang
Work that track, whip 'em like Kunta
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
By way of A-T-L; if you disagree
don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli
Uh-oh, Spaghetti-O's! Luda's oodles of noodles
And testin me is like pitbulls put up to poodles
My rap career goes back further than yo' father hairline
It's Ludacris - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
I'm fly, even when I get high I work cash
And even got my coats bumped up to first class
I'm boss to all employees - and I'm here to teach the principle
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Vorhees
Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man. I'm tired of
this shit man. Man I try to rap for the nigga, I try to get
a nigga tracks; he ain't hearin my shit. Man for real.
Man my four-year-old son can rap better than that nigga;
man that nigga garbage. Man I got talent too, the nigga ain't
hearin me. Man iii-iiiis this shit on? 'Cris, c'mon 'Cris.
'Cris, f'real man. FUCK YOU NIGGA, MAN FUCK YOU!
[Ludacris]
Fuck you too! What you wanna do, scrawny nigga
But I got a arsenal of automatics down to twenty-twos
Know how to use 'em, fight dirty as SHIT
I throw a grenade and all-in-one bury a CLIQUE
You see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And comin up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
I'm on a cool ranch, get laid more than Fritos
With five strippers, four wives and three amigos
I go scuba divin in Bays at Montego
I find gold links and snatch 'em like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinteted version of Mandingo
I've seen more Beatles and Jagged Edges than Ringo
I used to run numbers in line they caled me BINGO
Cause I'm big, you a little star, you just twinkle
Old asses like sharpeis, y'all all wrinkled
And I stay with more BULLETS than yo' Billboard singles
Ho that is just too much! You just gotta give applause
he is definitely all f'real - yaseeI'msayin? Ha ha I be
fuckin with him all the time, yahhmean? I'm sayin, I used
to just (?) now home come through he want filters a purple,
he want quarters a purple now. I want y'all to trip with it
man, I woulda sold him a Coupe (?) we coulda played with,
yaseewhatI'msayin?
[Ludacris]
Yeah, can I get a little hit of that, little nigga with a bigga sack
See piece of the bigger trap look at that God be rollin on that
Where they kick it at? And a lot of people just don't know
Shady Park you heard just don't go
Quick to flip the bird up po'-po'
Makin the way for that rodeo, that rodeo show!
Gotta hit 'em with a reload, I gotta put 'em with the people
I gotta make a nigga stop, drop, roll - oh no where the beat go?
Bring that, shit back, didn't wanna hear that, clik-clak
Tons of fun with guns
Fuck all the lil' chit-chat get back get that get that
Who knows, who goes there? Motherfuckers it's Poppa Bear
Stop and stare; pourin out a lil' gasoline and then drop a flare
I'm on, FIRE! And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!
Oh no, we stay swoll, rollin on Vogue TIRES!
Right down the avenue, passin you rapidly stackin
In the back of the Cadillac and packin emergency action
Camera, LIGHT LIGHTS, throwin a punch and then FIGHT FIGHT
Packin a lunch and then BITE BITE, A-T-L stay TIGHT TIGHT
I'm just tryin to save ya shorty. I'ma let you know
it's real down heah. When you ride down that two-eighty-five,
and you go past Kincaid, get ready to go past that Cambleton Road
fo' you get it cut free shorty just shave; cause dat where dem

Matter of fact, just shave when ya get to Georgia nigga.

You'll go ballistic, because I give it hood
Just like a nigga would, and like a nigga should
If you hear screamin' then Luda's up in your neighborhood

Crazy how you make me high when I'm sober
Just when I thought, I've seen it all, you put it down on me (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Addicted to the kisses your blow got me swole up

(Oh No!) I'm bout to send two to his dome
(Oh No!) Cry babies go home!
[Verse One: Ludacris]
I got people scared as FUCK like when condoms break
Or how your heart deals with eatin' eighty pounds of steak
So put your belly on a plate and watch your weight
You frostin' like a flake and Ludacris feels grrreat!
Who want come face me, face come want who?
And women give me face until they're face turns blue
They can't breathe, dick to mouth recessatation
A tight squeeze witch stops the length to conversations
I Playstations, duck cops and lose agents
I'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients
When I kick and rip and flip an indespensable rhyme
My black ass is so hungry I'll take a bite out of crime
And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke
Neighbors called the fire station off the blunt that I smoke
You see I crush cowards, funerals I'll send flowers
And I'm on the overpass flick pennies at rush hour
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: Ludacris]
You see I'm ambidextrous I slap ass with both hands
Delete your first steps, but I'll save the last dance
I just bought some new guns my mama said ""it ain't worth it""
But I'm at the shooting range just 'cause practice makes perfect
Bullseye, I stunt growth and stop lives
You run with niggas that's more chicken then pot pies
Bok bok bok I'm shakin your tale feathers
I got big balls, I'm a SAC King like Chris Webber
Luda' will take you back to duck hunt and double dribble
When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
My cars got big TVs and satellites
I got a Wheel of Fortune 'cause I flipped O's like Vanna White
And the servey says? (Kill a mutha fucka now)
Could it be off with his head? (Or shoot a mutha fucka down)
Ground round, ground chuck your ground beef
Bullets gather round then I shoot rounds around teeth
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Ludacris]
I kick niggas in they're ass reboot 'em like laptops
And they wouldn't even box if I gave 'em a flat top
You punks pucker and pout, bicker and babble
Now they all lost for words like I beat 'em in Scrabble
You see I'm from a small town called ""Fresh out a cop's ass""
Where Mr. Head-Potatoes are skinned they get mashed
I smell puss from fifty yards
Y'all not playin with full decks as if I jacked out ya Jacks and left fifty cards
Catch me in Vegas spinnin' the green
I re-up with more chips than a vending machine
Then you can catch me in Rome making some brauds and sticking 'em
And you'll be at home picking your bougars and flicking 'em
A drug dealer's dream, so fresh and I'm so clean
I'm a grown ass man and you're sweeter than sixteen
So go and kick rocks peons you're just rookies
Headed down stairs to get you some milk and cookies

It's hard growin' up lookin' at drug dealers wit' all this paper
Wonderin' how I can get me some
My family's strugglin', I'm buggin', sittin' on my porch
So confused, chewin' on some bubblegum
I was always taught to use my manners with the misses
But please, stay away from the hoes and snithes
And I was always reached for the sky, I dont know why
Ima little bitty kid wit' a whole buncha gangsta wishes
When I grow up, you just wait, Ima be so straight
And everything's gonna be so marvelous
No more borrowin' from the neighbors, no more haters
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
Ima have it made in the shade, Ima be so paid
And my fam, get 'em off that payin' them bills
Matta fact Im schemin' my way on up out this hood, I'll be good

Been patient waitin' on my set of wheels
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
It's too many holes in my socks, and I'm ready to box
Anyone tellin' me I need better shoes
And I aint the only one trippin', or makin a fuss
My older cousin need some cheddar too
He thinkin' 'bout comin' up on the lick, to get it quick
It involves that local corner store
I overheard him say he knew who works there
And whatever they do, dont let the owner know
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want
Ima tell him I wanna...

Why cant I walk with a limp mama? wont be no drama
For goodness sakes, Im just a kid
Had to get my whoopin' in fo's, I was just a po'
Like there no remorse for what I did
Gotta learn the hard way, when runnin' them streets
How some just creep, really just to eat a meal
""I coulda swore it was mine,"" what I used to tell the po-pos
What I left to rob and steal
Man, I gotta earn for a livin', aint nobody givin' me nothin'
Find somethin' I love to do
Hmm, what about that pimpin'? It's good tippin'
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
Why cant work feel like retirement?

This is for the diamonds and the watch all clustered
Spread em like mustard, canary yellow
Now women in my face like hello
Yea I'm sort of a big deal
These Giovanni rims are sort of a big wheel
This five course dinner is sort of a big meal
This Bentley GT can make Luda dissapear
Faster than David Copperfield mothafucka

Yea I'm just a playboy between penthouse sheets
Hit the club and go and party with some penthouse freaks
Party with Britney, Lindsay and Paris together
Get in line and buyin' bottles that's taller than Chris Webber
And makin haters sneeze from diamonds and sick leathers
Cause my ice gives em cold like they as if they under the weather

Live in mansions and drive around in gangsta whips
You swear I'm bout to get into some gangsta shit
Oh no here comes trouble, my vision is skewed
I can only see in doubles, two models two bottles
That'll pop like bubbles and when I get home
The girls tops lift off like airspace shuttles
60 seconds till blast off
My car got a face lift and took it's mask off
Tint so dark it look like I took the glass off
The body was white for 8 weeks
Before I finally decided to take it's cast off
Now it's blacker than a bottom less pit
You talk shit you'll end up with bottom less lip
I hit a nigga so hard, I'll make him swallow his spit
Then I be with Bobby V on that anonymous shit

The hottest nigga on the mic
Yea I believe that's me
Now all the ladies wanna give a lil TLC
Cause Luda was set for life after 3 LPs

Cause the blocks got it's eyebrows down, ya heard me)
[Verse One: Ludacris]
I'm still back for the first damn time
So grab a hold of your seat while I OPEN YOUR MIND
And take you back from when I dropped down from heaven
And I came on my moms and I had a MIC as my fucking weapon
When I was three I was just a little G
But if you looked in my eyes you would see the future of a real MC
And at the age of nine I wrote my first ryhme
Soon rapping became one of my favorite pasttimes
Everywhere that I went spitting and dabbling
Showing my ass growing up and started traveling
From one city to the next luda landed in the ATL
Where the pimps and the players dwell
I made a tape did shows and got EX-PO-SURE
And kept learning as my black ass got OLDER
No matter what I just kept at my trade
I made mistakes but still stayed sharper than a GINSUI BLADE
[Chorus X2]
[Verse Two: Ludacris]
Age 14, my talent show, a beast out of cage
Would have won, but got disqualified for JUMPING OFF STAGE
But I didn't care cause this game started to open it's arms
When I was at Banaker High School pulling fire alarms
So I could get a crowd around me make a name for my BLOCK
People told me keep flowing they didn't want me to STOP
Back when big nose John was my human beatbox
Skipped out on school hit open campus and look out for street COPS
Now I'm known around the town as that ""Nigga who raps""
From the hill of Maze high to them G roll traps
And I was still making demos perfecting the craft
Some said I wouldn't make it they would giggle and laugh
So I picked up a couple books from DONALD GOINES
About the busimess of this shit and how to FLIP A FEW COINS
By the age of eighteen I was destined to MAKE IT
My bank account read DISTURBING THE PEACE INCORPORATED
[Chorus X2]
[Verse Three: Ludacris]
Age 18, I'm struggling just to survive
But I got a gig working for change at 97.5
Now I'm rapping on the radio increasing their NUMBERS
Still Ludacris, but Alias was Chris LOVA, LOVA
Late nights I'm in the studio using they tools
Me and Poon was smoking weed and breaking all of they rtules
And I was krunk, ALL THE BIG WIGS WAS HEARING MY SONGS
But nobody did SHIT and they was taking too long
Three years went past and I saved enough cash
To make my own record company and put my self on BLAST
the album was independent it was just for the streets
I sold one thousand albums in my first fucking week
Then went on to sell fifty, put the cash in my hand
All the record companies biting, but I chose Def Jam
The main reason that I made it and I love the A town
Was because the BLOCK had it's EYEBROWS DOWN, ya heard me
[chorus X2]
[Outro: Ludacris]
Yah, Ive' been waiting a lifetime to get what the fuck I got
It's real man
Hardest working nigga in show business
Believe that
Shout out to Lil fate, I dub, Chaka Zulu

The people's music I used to play some happy and some jealous
Cause I'm showered with cash and they can't remove they umbrellas

It's two a.m. in the morning and it uhh..

Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
[Ludacris]
I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the L.A.C.
So later on we'll be rollin
Drop-tops I'm hittin yo' hot spots I'm top notch
My niggaz never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin game at the A.U.C.
that later on we'd be bonin
Fat cats I'm ready to tap that so back that
No wonder why you wakin up up swollen
[Twista]
I'm feelin you Luda', smokin my buddha, coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
on the back and leave it drippin down the crack of her ass
Call me Mr. Magillicuddy, chasin booty sucker silly puddy
Killin for money, still a thug get bump; from some pokin
and locomotion hittin bunnies, for threesome getcha buddy
When I'm feelin scummy I love to cut
[Ludacris]
Tan skin so, butter soft I'm rippin the buttons off yo' - BLOUSE
Smell the aroma of a dingaling king Ludacris when I'm in yo' - HOUSE
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down - SOUTH
Hot fellatio, hot jalapenos holla while they in yo' - MOUTH
So we love that k-k-k-k
[Hook]
[Twista]
Now I got the feelin we can cut the hell out each other
And I hope we be the same thang - freaks
We can get the mattress goin eh-err, eh-err
Handlin business while I bang bang - skeet
Wash the dick off and kick off another session again
I can break 'em off in the shower, kitchen flo' or the outdoors
The pieces from the East is the shit
and the flesh in the West is the best
but Twista love them Chicago and South hoes
[Ludacris]
Come up out yo', negligee, freak 'em on a regular day
Cum six times - but it's seven today
Ludacris in the back of your Chev-e-rolet
Ahh, ahh! What's my name?
So magical I come and touch the game
You motherfuckers really lust to gain
Nothin but hatin and a look of disgust
So it's must, stay ""Adrenaline Rush""
Wonderin why they don't be bustin the same
[Twista]
I'm clutchin my thang;
stuffin in it, strokin it down, beat the stuff up
Uh-uh shorty, don't run from it
She give me the booty I'm breakin it off
I can tell a style by the way that she walk
Fatty flickin like it was dubs on it
Peep how this player got skills, get 'em out the gator high heels
Pullin rubbers and swishers up out your Prada bag
Wanna smoke 'dro I got a bag, take a proper drag befo' I tap it
I love the chicks that got a lotta ass, so we love that k-k-k-k
[Hook]
[Ludacris]
Bubble, bubble bubbles is in the bathtub
Makin you stutter from the b-body butters and backrubs
It's killin me thinkin about the bottles that pop
The models that swallow willin, up under my pillow stayin strapped up
If it tickles in the middle from Mr. Pickles you try to escape
So give me the rope you gettin wrapped up
Rooty tooty so fruity and fresh, I'm fresh and fruity
Ya duty's to figure the booty's gettin slapped up
[Twista]
I love them chicks that be thick as a loaf of bread
Long as I can still grab her legs, and push 'em up by her head
How I dip up in it we can make a video
but I got the radio bumpin Jagged Edge by the bed
When you wanna get up witcha cutty buddy
come on and dip up through the hideout with Twist'
But after we do what we gon' do getcha purse and get together
because now you gots to ride out - bitch!
[Ludacris]
Oh 'Cris, can you - do it again, that's what they askin me
Hit skins, causin catastrophes
Get pinned, by me and my family
Sip gin, fulfillin yo' fantasies
In yo condition I'm wishin you'll take a lickin
and keep on tickin from thicker thighs
Finger lickin never get sick and tired, just take a look in her eyes
and you can tell she's a figure five, so we love that k-k-k-k
[Hook]
[Jagged Edge - repeat 2X]
Cut up, gettin brains, in the Range
We love to cut up cause we like them freaky thangs
I like it when you let me try, anythang
Cause girl I ain't got nothin but time
Let a nigga get a little cut up girl
I come from the eighth planet in the 19th galaxy,
where the royal penis is clean, yo' majesty. Can it be,
Sheila E, Appalonia, Vanity, all mad at me? I'm the
Prince dick of insanity. I'm good lovin, body-rockin,
knockin boots all night long, we not stoppin.
I don't care if the kids watchin, I stir it like motherfuckin
coffee and brown sugar. Girls dem sugar. World class lover.
Kama sutra, porno music producer. Tallywhacker is a rock hard
storm trooper with a purple helmet, made for crushin
pink cookies. Goonie goo-goo, we cut bigfoots and wookies;
and fat women, because they need love too.
So go on big girl, whatchu gon' do?

Too many n*ggaz

Too many rookies

No hoes barber obey da block rules

I treat humans like students fail y'all
So turns ya books ta page 69 and start suckin
Orginize drop da track and start duckin
When Ludacris get in da bed start f*ckin
You wanna be startin somthin
Get out da booth
And let me tell y'all da truth
We kicks down doors
Save all da H2O
For front row
Live in da bank and watch for scank hoes
State called out and dat's out da off road
If you know what I mean
Proceed to state clean
Lights in a n*gga turn red but get green
Inhale some o dat dope o blow steam
Love tha combination big *ss in tight jeans!
(Verse 2)
Boy you o lost yo mind
No I lost my virginity
And I shot click like dat fool shot Kennendy
What's da remedy
Henesy
Coke
If you cut all yo money you still be half broke
Ashes ta ashes smoke will get smoked
We come outta masses You come and get choked
If you take me for a fool I'll take you for a joke
Tired o fast foods so they cooked up dope
Now we eatin lobster, shrimp, and thangz
And watch for imposters dat's been in da game
We invented da game
Y'all just got hip
Man what'z dat smell proboly yo upper lip
See I love ta walk around like my sh*t don't stank
Even if it's cigars o dat purple colored dank
Chillin in da hood wit no trace a Tom Hanks
Put dis in yo jaw like weeners and beef franks!
(Verse 3)
I put too much sugar in my Kool,-aid
And party like a king witta high top blade
Arrive to a show and I like ta get paid
Arrive to a hoe and I like ta get laid
Right up on my backs
like rugs and floor mats
I'm on da right page but what's my format
I wave ta da ocean cause I'm where shore's at
And women go nuts just like my balzac
Did you know dat
Man I'm da gift of change
Electric stores gon gimmie da keys ta da Range
Shagadellic beutifull but strange
Went ta Magic City saw Nikki and blue flames
Rearrange

Pastor E. and Jay'll letta n*gga right
Da ball-playin dude is on yo same flight
Da highlights dat I live a high *ss life!

Hands Up! Hands Up! Here's another one.. and a.. and a.. another one.

(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) Why you all in my ear? Talkin' a whole bunch a sh*t that I ain't tryin to hear. Get Back! You don't
know me like that. Get back! You don't know me like that!
(Ee-Ee Whoo-Whoo) I ain't playin' around.. Make one false move, I'll take you down. Get back! You don't know me like
that. Get back! You don't know me like that!
[Verse 1]
So, so, come on, come on. DON'T get swung on, swung on. It's the knick-knack-patty-whack still riding cadillacs. Family
off the streets, made my homies put the baggies back. (Whoo!) Still snaggin' plaques (yep), still action-packed (yep), and
dope.. i keep it flippin' like acrobats. That's why I pack a mack, that'll crack a back, cause on my waist, there's more
heat than the shaq-attack! But I ain't speakin' about ballin', jus' thinkin' about brawlin' 'til y'all start ballin'. We
all in together now, birds of the better now, jus' bought a plane so we change in the weather now. So put your brakes on,
cats put your capes on, and knock off your block, get dropped, and have your face blown. Cause I'll prove it, scratch off
the music, like hey little stupid, don't make me looose it!
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I came (I came), I saw (I saw), I hit him right dead in the jaw (in the jaw). [x4]
See I caught him with a right hook, caught him with a jab, caught him with an upper cut, kicked him in his ass. Sent him
on his way cause I ain't for that talk, and no trips to the county.. I ain't for that walk! We split like 2 pins at the
end of a lane, we'll knock out your spotlight and put indian fangs. Holding DTP pinned at the end of yo' chain, and put
the booty of a swish at the end of a flaamme.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Hey, you want WHAT with me?! I'm gonna tell you one time, don't F*CK with me! Get down! Beat his ass.. ain't got nothin'
to lose, and i'm havin a bad day, don't make me take it out on you! [x2]
Maann, cause I don't wanna do that. I wanna have a good time and enjoy my drink.. sit back and watch some women get drunk
as hell, so I can wake up in the morning with a story to tell. I know it's been a little while since I've been out the
house, but now I'm here.. you wanna stand around runnin' yo' mouth? I can't hear nothing you sayin' or spittin', so what's
up? Don't you see we in the club?, man shut the f*ck up!

Ah! We in the red light district!
Ah! We in the red light district!
Whoo! We in the red light district!

You gotcha way witha beauty
A treat with a brain
When she look at you she only see ""ching-ching""
Mil around your neck, mil around your arms
A championship ring, she must be a bowla hard
She turns on the leader, as soon as you need her
Once you bite the bait, you look mighty thico
When money talks she ticks like F.B.I
Ready to handcuff the right guy
Look you in the eye, and tell a boldface lie.
Scheming on the way to money yo, well ya tried
Guess its a game now, gotta watch who you trust
Like her because, its only out for your books
Ye sir, shes all about being paid
At the end of everyday its a fine new grade,
What more can i say? But the wires up front
Better watch out, she'll leave yah with insuffiant
Chorus
She's so physical.
I say movie stars you better watch your back
She'll be spending up your cheque
Oh yeah. For the growin... just won't stop
Will be rotting in your eyes
She's a...Gold digga, gold digga, gold digga yeah.
She's dreaming scheming on a way to get your dough
She hit the lottery now hit the flow, you just don't know
because you got got and thats for show
Oh eyah she's a superstar chick
But don't fool with her unless you got miles of risk
She's a pimpstress runnin' more game than the Olympics
to cease your assests like the I.R.S
Aha uh uh huh

Okay, I remember the days
High rights, low lefts, Even Stevens and Faze
Troops Lotto and BK's those was the days
High tech boots spray paintin' wit'cha name
T-shirts airbrushed that read the same
They carryin Bone's chain
One gone but yo we miss ya'
Harris photos school shots can you remember
Bury him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didnt lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed hand off clated craze
Just to reiterate dog those was the days
Fo' da invasions of hatas I aint cool to mile around
Use to get down at True Flavas bumpin Key Lo
Walkin' damage cross colored and Paco
While play more step than talent shows
Prom nights tux and cane know its so cool
Fuck them new model cars we ridin' old school (old school)
[Chorus - Keon Bryce]
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause eventhough we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And thats how it went
When we were kids
[Fate Wilson]
In 3 months we stayed in Jamestown
Hamwood and Diplomats
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
We was lovin' that
Before to started jackin jacks
For notes from Red Oaks had folks scared to come through
College Park after dark
Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware...wang wiggas was out there
But we didnt care kids was gettin' stabbed and ditched out there
To busy playin'...Double Dare
You touched shorty on the ass that's a bet
Want ya Kool-Aid and sugar smack ya hands and say sweat
It's mine now place it in my Louie Vaton pouch
Thump a nigga on his knuckles make him say ouch
Slout socks box Chevy Caprice
Hot knees cut da holes Disturbing Tha Peace
Wit no conscience broke niggas call em nonsense
No com-mission this is lil fate payin' homage
[Chorus - Keon Bryce]
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause eventhough we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And thats how it went
When we were kids
[Ludacris]
I had a Long John but no Silver
No gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
With 2 sides to a book I lick stamps and light matches
And set fires in garbage pales and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barb wire clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my click turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddy
I brush teef brush naps and cause treats
Dreamin' of Cadillac with wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for ACTION!
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin all that goddamn noise
[Chorus - Keon Bryce (x2)]
We were tryin so hard
Hard to survive
Cause eventhough we were young
We had to stay strong
No matter what we went through

I'm tryin to make it through these hard times

Hard times (hard), hard times (hard)
[Verse One: Ludacris]
You never know how much you miss a person, until they gone
Like to hear it? Hear it go, I'm rehearsing, gotta sing my song
I know I've done some wrong, but I can't get right
Cause life is like a big fight
I'm stickin-and-movin, tryin to get my shit right
My family's been houndin me, friends they done turned against me
Kinda like they hearts was on a full tank, but now they empty
And they say I've changed, but like twins I'm just the same
It's because of my job, mo' money mo' prob in this dirty game
This industry FUCKED UP
That's right I said it, and it's fake as ever
Keep real niggaz around me, stay ""Space Age 4 Eva""
Po-ppa never went and jumped the broom, never got that one degree
But if you looked down from heaven, you'd still be proud of me
Your son was DUI, but my momma made it by
I didn't shed no tears when you left me
but the rest of the family cried
Trials and tribulations, ruined my concentration
Losin my patience, hard times for goodness sake'n
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: Eightball]
As this Valium slowly starts to kick in
Them subconcious, subliminal thoughts, start tickin
This whole world around me, diseased, and crumblin
Babies doin dope cause daddy did it right in front of them
Everybody wanna blame music for they bad kids
Sittin up in the court talkin 'bout Eminem made me do what I did
My own hard times rolled in like the fog
Try to think of others, but I can't get past my own thoughts
My momma, in 1967, pickin cotton
While other blacks was gettin liberated, boycottin
My old man was a player, ain't no hidin that
He started tootin then he graduated to smokin crack
I never saw him, never needed to see that muh'fucker
He left me and my mother stuck down here in this fuckin gutter
I tattoed it on my arm so I can't forget it
It's in my mind and my heart so I'm forever with it
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: MJG]
A drum machine, the old fo'-track, and a pack of new tapes
In the middle of, 1988, in a corner cafe
We made beats, and hung with old heads, and stayed out late at night
Do talent shows, fo'-way split the dough, that was our way of life
My momma stayed, home full time so she could raise me
Knowin without a, household father, things could get crazy
Sometimes I listened, sometimes I thought I knew it all
But nevertheless, momma was with me through it all
I graduated out of nothin, not out of school, it was like
12, 13, 14 years I'm thinkin cool
I might as well, be focusin on me tryin to get paid
Usin these rhymes I've been writin since in the 7th grade
Our team played, and had physical sex with minimum wage
It was just like a piece of pussy
It fucked me long as I stayed
But still I prayed, Lord I'm tryin now please help me out the water
It can't get no harder
Help me to get back up and get my shit tomorrow

And im close to the edge so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin a fool from the traps to the birbs
My filthy mouf it wont fight cavities or beat plaque
So i shot the tooth fairy (aahhh) and took my old teeth back
I'll take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make Government officials breath harder than Darth Vader
Its the chicken & the beer that make Luda keep rappin
But no pork on my fork i dont even speak pig Latin
I go fishen on my lake wit some bitches to bake
Plus i eat many MC's but i dont gain no weight
The number 1 cheif rocker clean out your rap lockers
Im as stiff as a board your more shook than maracas
But my tricks aint for kids if you dig em' you'll get smaked
I'll clap yah, i'll spring forward you far back (whoo)
Every album that i drop has got more than ten bangers (yeah)
Thats cause im a shot caller ya'll fools are crank yankers (bells)
Aint a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
I get chicks from Portland Oregan to Portland Mayne
Now i role up torpedoes, get blunted wit rastas
For a hefty fee im on your record like Bob Castas (yeah)
I own so many jerseys, im a throw-back mess
I hit the cleaners an tell em' ""i want a full court press"" (owe)
So mama toast yah glass while im countin my cash
Cause every single is a smash, im hot as a camals ass (ha)
The competition never just wanna admit that they lost
And that they last about as long as my part in The Wash
From your car to crack no one roles witchu
One of MiniMe's shoes got more soul than you (ok)
So by the time you figur out why your record aint spinnin
Im in the strip club smokin, wit Presedent Clinton (cough cough cough)
So stay of the long side-burns and gold teeth (teeth)
They make the mold of the penis and larger off me (me)
I'll be in another when i hit from the back (back)
Not to mention my refridgerators taller than Shaq (yeah)
So yippie ka ye yippie ya ya yo (yo), if you cant swim dont smoke my hydro (dro)
I've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But alotta ya'll are more stuck up than tampons (whoo)
So wash all you sins away and stop playin (yeah)
If God's line is busy you might have to two way him (uh hmm)
And catch me in your back yard playin crokay
And im drunk im tellin kids ""drugs are bad umm-kay""
Or watch me swing my chains at the Rascals of Peko
Got seven cars get on my rims at chrome depo
And people think im bad they say ""ooh he's so evil""
Cause i go on blind dates with actual blind people (owe)
But my albums out the store, yours be on the shelf (uh hmm)
I heard you masterbate alot so ya'll keep to yourself
Cause these women want a man to stay up and stay strong
Like the NBA, you gotta play hard or go home
All that shit that ya'll talkin ya'll can pop it to them
Cause Ludacris will beat you down with a prosthetic limb
I'll put so deep in your ass that you can smell it
And your breath'll turn to Footlocker water repelant
Im the man i got money far as the eyes can see
And im in a group i split do wit me me and me
So much money in my jury that im damn near sorry
So ima trade my earings in, and get a Ferrari (whoo)
I buy cars wit straight cash, have meetins wit Donald Trump
Yall meet wit Honda, no payments for 12 months (uh huh)
Take a look at your life and no wonder your so sad

Hey! Thank all yall for comin' out tonight
It was a beautiful night tonight and The Shizznit
Where pimpin' and dead, these hoes just scared
Thanks Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, all the niggas from the LBC
It was a beautiful night tonight
Oh, look at these fools, Ay! Security! Come get these niggaz!
[Verse 1 - Luda (Snoop)]
Fresh off the streets, just finished a show in Long Beach
Ready to relax, kick up my feet
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)
Oh, nothin' just called, lookin' for some women that can fondle my balls
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that
Gimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back)
Off to the hotel, I was ready indeed
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed
Put one up in the air, the cops just stared
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care
Got to the tele and I slid thru the door
On to the elevator, hit the penthouse floor
And what would happen next only time could time
Cuz I got up to my room, and I was mad as hell (Aaah! Damn!)
[Chorus]
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?
[Verse 2 - Luda]
Now it was five B.A.P hoes and they look like trash
But one was midget, so we'll just say four and a half
I was stuck speechless, couldn't believe my eyes
What'd I do to deserve this unpleasant surprise?
And I was thinkin' to myself, ""This is just my luck""
Then my nigga bust in like ""What the fuck!?""
(Oh shit it's Snoop!)
[Snoop (Luda)]
Who in the hell let them booger bears out they cell (Not me)
And what they doin' in ya' room? Nigga make 'em bail (Yeah)
Got some fine bitches, dime bitches on they way (Okay)
And told security, ""Let 'em in, with no delay"" (Ha Ha!)
So when they get here, they'll probably be like half naked
Don't mean to trip out, but bitch yall got to dip out (Dip Out!)
Catch the elevator up one floor
Presidential with the slidin' key for the door (Oh No!)
What the fuck goin' on? Shit, all around the world Luda, then its the same song
Them bitches was so ugly, I told 'em to go home
[Chorus]
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Man who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Oh no!)
(Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Well who let 'em in then?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Get out!)
[Verse 3 - Luda (Snoop)]
Now, these chicks wouldn't leave, they was ready to clown
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds
(No she didn't come thru with a thong on
She did for the hell of it, big fat whale of it)
You can't seperate me, Ima seperate you
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew
(You filthy, nasty, sick in the head
Sittin' in my dressin room with dick on ya' bread)
She said ""I want you to climb in this underwear, silly""
But I was turned off by her tupper-ware titties
(Fake bitches, break bitches, make bitches
Kick rocks, when they fucked up in they face
Tick-tock, you gots to get up out my space
Hey Ludacris let's get the fuck up out this place, let's bounce)
Then it got to my head, and somethin' reminded me
I know who let 'em in, it was Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)
[Chorus]
Who let these hoes in my room?
(Who let these hoes in my room?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
(I need to know, who let these hoes in?)
Who let these hoes in my room?
[Snoop, Talking]
Ay, ay yall gotta go
Yall gotta get the fuck up outta here, ugly ass bitches
I dont understand how these bitches always get in my dressin' room
You know what I'm sayin'?
Soon as I get off stage, it's 7 or 8 ugly ass bitches posyed up in my dressin room
And security act like they dont know who did it
I know you feel what I'm sayin', I'm my nigga around the whole world
We need to form a society or somethin'
Fat, gorilla, monkey mouth bitches cant get in our mothafuckin' dressin room or backstage
And if they do, we kindly put our foot up their asses
And re-direct them bitches to security dressin' room, you dig?

Good luck, time to get hood stuck
Caldasac trap, Mr. Good Stuff
Ludacris give me 20 push-ups
Last summer, got da hook up
You know what I did
Who'd eva thought up they grew up on one of the BeBe Kids
Type of rat, sat on my ass
And fiendin' for cash
Almost got signed with Puff Puff, but I think I'll pass
Now what we got 'round here is a 20-20 twins
and whats up in my hand, is a bottle of Gin
I love women so I'm in it to win it
In it to green
In it to get in it and get in it again
You got two booties so you whippin yo chin
And I don't blame you
I lay in da sand, ya'll lay in da snow and make angels
My ice piece dangle
make my chest look older
Touch it and fall apart like yo High school folder
I'ma Trojan man, BHS hall supplier
Shady park resident and southside Rider
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
Get back, time to get hood jacked
Gold chain, took dat
World of Ghetto fabolous Dopeboys and Hoodrats
Becareful what you look at
cause you lookin to long
You might go blind in my briefs cause my dick is too long
I'm gettin nutt while I'm singin this song
and there is enough for everybody in da party
while ya'll hittin da bong
But ya'll be hittin my schlong
you play the flute quite nicely
When teeth interrupt, you can watch as I get fiesty
Oh no, you suckas didn't request back up
Broads I seem to rack up
When I pull da gold acta
Get slapped up
Drove up da wall
Put it in Reverse
you can hope for the best, but expect the worst
You at a place like some D's on a Hurst
Its quite funny
Phat Rabbit, playboy bunny
It seems as if thats what I need
Filthy south and Ds
Thats why I roll in from da Southside breeze
Give it to me now
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
Your pick time to get hood sick
Hit'em wit a good lick
Clean out yo house from da couch to da toothpick
EastSide Ruthless
WestSide leave 'em clueless
my Northside mackers got dis broads actin foolish
And do this for a living
while you stuck up in yo cubicle
Nightlife runnin dis streets, it sounds beautiful
Women break a cuticle
Ballas break bread
Southside, I represent it till I'm dead
What wha
[Chorus x2]

Ooooh you feel that as i take you to them dirt roads deep in your southern roots
When nobody said life was going to be easy and we travel to this emotional roller coaster called life
And we have our ups and downs
Just keep in mind
When you hit rock bottom
There aint no where to go but up baby
Just all you about how you deal wit it you feel me.. listen here
[chorus]
When life seems hopeless
It make a nigga lose focus
Empty beer bottles and roaches, helps to get it off my chest cause
Im so stressed and all i here is ""fuck tha world"" [2x]
[verse 1: ludacris]
Man ever since life been a gamble
My life been in shamblez
Double edge sword burnin both sides of the candle but cris but you cant handle the truth
Dont wanna face reailty
So lord accept my apology
Please like when police say freeze
And i aint do shit
But im down on my knees
Its a crooked system but gin straight take the pain away i charge the game
And put my problems on layaway
A black man but i feel so blue
So i smoke green and purple til my dreams come true
Then my eyes turn red
Sky turns grey
Children slangin white in the hood
We call it yaay drink old gold
Down my yellow brick road
Then rewrite my script til my story is untold
See i got a little money and my life sped up now
Im fallin and i cant get up
[chorus 2x]
[verse 2: trick daddy]
I had to dream about a dope fiend
And its strange cause he can bearly write or read but seems to get folkz about anything curious about him
I wanted to talk to him but he was to busy fo that
But i was more then welcome to walk with him
As we walked
He talked and i just listen
He said theres a big differnce between crackas and niggas
See he said white folks look out fo the white folks but uh black folks blang wit tha black folks
When they aint enough black roakz
When you ooh to make a long story short
We need pay more attenion and do things that are more compleset and he told me
You kno i woulldnt say something that wouldnt work and i wouldnt damnwaste my time telling something that would hurt you
But you would fall for anything
If you dont stand for something
But thats for certain but niggas dont be listen and that shit be hurting
No all of us but some of us
And if we dont hurry up
They going to bury each and every one of us
And if we dont hurry up
[chorus repeat 2x w/ trick daddy]
[verse 3: ludacris]
Sometimes i cant deal wit my daily issues
Just being sober lifes a bitch and i cant control her
I wish i could and sometimes to cry on
We need a shoulder
The goverment stand us up
To run us over
And in the hood they dont seem to understand
God damn whats really got me wondering
Is if its a part of a bigger plan man
I smell some thing fishy goin on and its way beyond blowin away the smoke from these swisher
Goin on it aint much i can do about it but preach the word of telling my people to spend ya money wisely dont be obcared
By some things that depresiated like what like a home to open ya eyes to
Whats the fucks thats goings on cause the constantly getting rid of us one by one wither its drugs or diesase or gun by
Gun i aint no saint either i feel that im even doing wrong by usein this chorus to get thru this song
[chorus repeat 2x w/ trick daddy]
[outro: trick daddy]
You know yall going to mess around and complain about slavery that was over 40 50 years ago black folks need to move on
Yall keep playin wit a crackerthey going to have yo ass tied up wired up to them back roads south florida and they made
Them laws say they cant do anything for you can a church get a amen and god for the thugs.

Check me out, look
It goes love, hate, pleasure and pain
Fo' albums in the can and I'm STILL in the game (what up?)
And last album, they don't like me to tell this
Debuted at #1 and sold more records than Elvis (shut up!)
That's what they tellin me, switch up your melody
Through with misdemeanors, they tryin to give rappers felonies
So they can lock us up one at a time
But true writers stay FREE in e'ry one of our lines
And if you not feelin I'm the cream of the crop
I'll KNOCK rappers off your list 'til I get to the top!
Still you lookin at a man that's financially stable
Only nigga gettin checks cut from four different labels
That Pillsbury dough, women poke my guts
Still I walk around the streets like I'm broke as FUCK
So if you see me in your town and I appear to be moody
It's cause I'm thinkin 'bout plans that's bigger than Serena booty
Me and Shaka still starvin and lookin for meals
And HEADS UP! Ludacris is almost out of his deal
I'm over ten million sold, every album is CRACK
And for now I'm bout to carry Def Jam on my BACK
Mad rappers I hear you talkin way down at the bottom
Though I make big money, still handle small problems
The ramblin at the mouth, I don't PLAY THAT SHIT
I'm the best and I ain't really got SAY THAT SHIT!

You can get your whole crews, even niggas that owe you
They ain't paid you shit you can drink some cold brew

you can come and find us, be right behind us and insert the clip
You hear something that went ""clack"" ""clack"" ""clack""
Somebody went down but it wasn't us
you can settle 'bout two meals get hooked up with a good deal
Start stackin' dough you can ride your mobile
Get 20 inch big wheels and collect some hoes
Tou can even start eatin' good and smokin' good

Somebody went bankrupt shiit but it wasn't us

All over again clean
or you can tell a bunch of officers that I'm the one to catch
But my niggas is the police
you can try to blame me or even try to frame me but I'll make bail now
somebody goin' to jail shit but it wasn't us
You do track after track, and walls get plaque after plaque

You could've had that good life, good kids and a good wife
It was yours to earn but the records stores gettin' returns

but when the shit start comin to a close
shiiit but it wasn't us
You can use your back-up plan, even call him your back-up man
and start think'in quick
You can call on your back-up hoes, even call the back-up pros
and tell 'em to suck a dick

and you tell just to pay the fees
and to pay their dues, and they catchin those STD's

sister, mother so glad to see you
so glad your parol came through
so glad everybody came out this morning
we reading from the book of hush, today
verse sixty-nine, come on somebody, come on somebody
good to see all of you came out this morning
even though some of you just leave at one twelve
smellin like booty, and hennessee, come on
cabasille double shots, ha-hah, it dont matter!
[Chorus]
Keep it on the hush, dont say nothing
Aint gone be no talking, while Im doing my thang
Keep it on the hush, dont say nothing
Aint gone be no talking, while Im doing my thang
[Ludacris]
Im loving the way your legs go so far back, your one of those flexible girls
I figure your daddy always said you was one of the best in this world
But never the less in this world, Im just proffesional girl
I teach 'em a lesson, have 'em stressin and confessin the girl
How good it was, and how good it could be, if they just tried it
Taking my double dosage skip the daily dick diet
T-ried it, they so excited, and cant hide it
Im trying to do my thang, but you gotta be quiet
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
Now even when i just come in your house
and cover your mouth because your momma is home
You grippin' the sheets and making a effort not to holler and moan
You got to keep it on the hush, cause we in no rush
You tellin' me its the little things that mean so much
And its an illusion to think you can match what I can do best
So if ya man call, tell him to put some hair on his chest
But he dont even have to know, we keepin it on the low
You walking it like a dog, and stay working it like a pro, so..
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
Imma taste ya neck, and begin to nibble around your earlobes
Down to your belly button, then im un-snappin' your bra
thinkin' your titties are tryna tell me somethin
Hard nipples, colder then ice-sicles
Workin' it with my tounge, you can just tell me if it tickles
Freaky deaky kinda sneaky, Ludacris and the gang
Disturbin' the peace, we runnin' the streets and steady slangin' them thangs
But you gotta keep the noise down, in order to keep the boy down
Its joy all around, and you know how it sounds, if you just..
[Chorus - repeat til fade]

As the crime scene evolves, the doors are open, the doors are open
Look at you sister Johnson in the front row

In this life one thing counts
In the bank, large amounts
[Luda speaks in the background]
[Verse One]
Now everybody wants a piece of my pie
And it don't help when I'm screaming on these records that I'm rich
Calling people from my number now I Bligh
Cuz there's nothing worse then getting horned by a stockin' ass bitch (oh yeah)
Cuz good game are talkin' and yet you're so true some women will have you feeling blue like cris
I lay my feet upon the path and now I'm walkin'
I spread my well (?) someone close will have me layin' in a ditch
I have my friends steal from me
Snatch my credit card and my wallet hit the town and leave (?) bills for me
They say I got the cash for it and I can't recall one single member of my family that never
asked for it
They've been kicking down doors and bustin' out flows
They can't get me on the phone so they surprise me at my show
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear ""common cuss you know I'm good for it"" (man)
[Chorus 4X]
[Verse Two]
Now don't get me wrong cuz being rich is such a beautiful thing
But more money, more problems people drive me insane
Now giving no handouts no more so take advantage and flee
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
Put them in position and make their wishes come...true
So they can have multiple accounts gain interest over night
Given a million dollars, what you gone...do?
Wrap your life for your kids-kids or would you spend it over night?
Now see me I do both I got a limited fun
My daughters life was set before (?) turned one
And it don't help that I got 4 or 5 retirement funds
So if I (?) before I'm 30 I can lay in the sun
My (?) can show and prove the real meaning of fun
That's why I live by the sword but you can die by my gun
The IRS `ll never sweat me or even put up a fight
Cuz I'm sure I pay more in taxes then you made in your life
Because...
[Chorus 4X]
[Verse Three]
Now women these days don't want a man without a nice pay check
So he splurge even though our lives ain't in right place yet
Buying jewellery and some cars just to impress these whores
Meanwhile you (?) poor ""daddy why you left me for?""
Yeah but it all comes back that's why I named my daughter Karma (yup)
Who teaching me the lesson of life and making me smarter
I sweep her off her feet cuz I'm her knight in shining armour
And I have your fucking head if anybody tries to harm her
Got to teach her about the game that most of us niggaz are spitin?
About these scandalous ass women that get money thru gifts
They suck a cold hard wood for some cold hard cash
Or ride a brother good to put a foot up on the gas
So that brand new ride pick up our friends
While you're slippin` she slides
Drop top Benz gold diggers inside
Crazy what the world will do for money
Thinking that everything will be alright
Cuz...

Be a good girl now, turn around, and get these whippings,

On the street of old Nash

And I had to fix a goodie bag and make decisions and heist 
Cause Soulfood ain't the mutherfucking thing to waste 
So lets get looney on the set cause I got five on the fire 
Will slide through Eastpoint and make our way to blackrighya 
Looking like Outkast on the spot smoking blunts 
Hit the liquor store 
Got up got out and got something 
The 8 ball so I could do some space age pimpin 
My blood stay young off of 45 colts and chicken

Riding 
Verse 2: 
It's just one of those day when 
I can kick it like this and like that 
It's a free world my folks got Rowdy 
Where you at 
I'm right off cascade or Ralph David Avenue 
And I shall proceed or continue to keep my roots nappy 
Cause afro and all ceasers they keep me warm 
Some living a thug life so how long were they born 
I still rhyme that's why I bounce my way to bankbread 
I so bad that I'll knock you out 
That's what my mamma said 
Sippin on brandy sunny days wit my best friend 
Hit her you seein then cruise to the Westend 
They should have said that it was Six Flags 
Over Georgia then underground if my crew 
Stays we'll be fat when I'm older 
If I told you once I told you ass a 
Thousand times that I got em all in 
Check when it comes to bustin rhymes 
Don't sweat the technique as I just move the crowd 
My Mob Deep of alcoholics people label us 
Loud because we riding 
(Chorus) 
Verse 3: 
See I felt my bones jump 
As I crossed the road 
I heard the squad was quite def so I flipped my mode 
On my way to DEC baby can't you see 
That the cader is too BIG for the 
Lost boys riding around in Lexus coups Jeeps and Beakers 
Yo cars get scooped just like Regina Carpet Cleaners 
In stone mountain cats putting it down 
Daz n Kurupt so I just gave all my dogs a pound 
Now my conflict was crucial off some hey smoke 
I should be getting it cause life is too god damn short 
And now my mind play tricks 
And all my boys acting ghetto 
Back to the CP I put my pedal to the medal 
God bless the child that's just got it's own 
Since I was a juvenile I'm making cash money at home 
Now from a boy to a man I reached the end of my road 
It's Ludacris signing off till the next episode. 
(Chorus) 
Cause it's the ATL 
Where all the pimps and the playas just dwell 
We got the cash find the ass then bail 
We leave a trace but never leave a trail.

[Ludacris]
Yeah, hah..
When it all come down to it we ain't have shit!
(Woo! Use your mouth, haha)
Ludacris, 4-Ize, it's like this
[Verse One]
I make niggaz eat dirt and fart dust
Then give you a eighty dollar gift certificate to Pussies 'R Us
I eat the whole pie, and leave nuthin but the crust
So you can feel what it's like, with instinct but no guts
A sac wit no nuts or a mack wit no sluts
Give me a full-body massage, I still can't be touched
They call me Seymour Butts, cause I get mo' ass than most
They say I'm next and got that butter love, and get too close
Follow the leader cause I'm meaner than medula oblongota
My +Tribe's+ on more +Quests+ than +Midnight Marauders+
It's all pi'a coladas, no cops and robbers
Takin trips back and forth from here to the Bahamas
I hump more than llamas, get rolled more than tires
If you say I'm not nice, then youse a motherfuckin liar
Entitled to your Opini-ons, into the next millenium
So many +Major Coinz+ that I thought I had +Amil+lion
4-Ize.. 4-Ize whatcha? 4-Ize
[4-Ize]
Yo, I am goin to blow up the Earth
with my ""pew-36 explosive space modulator""
Buddha be praised, you meditator
Drop squad interrogator, 85 percent regulator
The Educator and the Almighty Creator, dedicater
The seperater of fiction, I spark friction
Smoking ""Hay"" without the +Crucial Conflict+ion
4-Ize prescription; microphone, Jackie Stallone
Psychic prediction, Egytian descripition
of my psychical, my flesh is weak and it's pitiful
Spiritiual is hooked up to the invisibile
umbilical cord of my Lord, Kumbiya Devine Kah
Remove paper of tar from every cigar
I slap authority like Gabor, Zsa Zsa
Half Allah, Half Anti Christ Superstar
Rockin the microphone with a hand like Dr. Claw
While I'm hittin trees - harder than Sonny Bono
Double Dragon, mixed up with an Abobo
I kill villians in slow-mo for talkin crazy in my Dojo
Got nothin to lose, like I'm a boxcar hobo
When I get Ludacris with bridges on the promo
Niggaz wanna clown; I'm +Homey+ and +Bozo+
Cause in the grand prize game my life callin like Jo-Jo
The name sticks like Toto
I keep it realer than alien autopsy photo
You similiar to a Spice Girl goin solo
You lost like BEBE, or a dog named Toto
My statue of liberty is Rebecca Lobo
We +Cop+ +Robo+, virgo
Bust ass like a motherfuckin homo, como estas?
Tony Del Negro
Built to destroy these kid's blocks of Legos
Lego my Eggo cause I say so
Hold the microphone, 4-Ize, I stay gifted
Manifested, elevated, I uplifted
The elevator, the esclator
""That's not a knife? That's a knife!""
Crocodile Dundee the Alligator Rustler
Cause I hustle ya, under the +China+
+Big Trouble+, little sewer but still I find ya
Cause I'm stinky
Manifest, throw you down the stairs like a slinky
Yo, my third eye is blinky

Yeahhhh baby, heh heh, yeahh!

Back again (that's right) Luda! Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
Feelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face! (Yeah)
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look
[Verse 1]
I'm never goin nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, HIIII MR. O'REILLY
Hope all is well, kiss the plantiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinded reppin harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)

Keep it goin it won't stop! (What you doin man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot!

Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Causin lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo

On my American bandstands
Summersaults cartwheels bitch just keep on dancing
Chinese splits-splits slide on down that pole-pole
And feel this dick-dick getting out a control-trol
Oh no keep going till a nigga like me say stoooop
Let it kiss the sky and then make it droooop
Cut and twist if you don't like it you can fuck and cris
I'm rubbing clits so stay in catch don't try to duck and miss
Do your stretches don't pull no handsprings
You got me moving in fact your doing the damn thing
Stronger muscles exercise every body your body hurts
Lets do this sweating thank god your bath and body works
I like a woman who makes her own doe don't need a lot of help
But your heart'll melt if I put a thousand in your garter belt
Lip-gloss traces your pierced in 11 places
And your lips down town just made some familiar faces like WHOA!

I'm ah send a chapter to this booty poppin legacy
China be that bitch can't no nigga don't fuck wit me
When I pop that cris I'm on that business and bubbly
When I'm in that 6 with 20s spinning on luxury
Cuz I got that head game
Picking up that bed frame
But don't get me wrong now shorty gone let that leg hang
Better learn that game shorty
Better get yo man shorty
For he end up tamed and be gone all in the brain shorty
This here be futuristic
This business so explicit
The way I brake it down for you bitch so explicit
Let it go now front back watch me drop it like that
Show me where that money at
Boy come wit them 100 stacks
Now break in wit that booty poppin
That booty poppin to the floor
And got these - he wanting more
Wit out that dough poppi ain't nothing happen
Cuz that's the show I'm from the go you get that - popping
Stopping that - dropping GONE
[Hook] - 2X
Every time we hit the club
What we need is 50 deep
Purple coat and grichi got everybody keyed
At the club 7 days a week party be be off in this -
More height poppin dropping - damn shorty who is this
Redbone wit a Scorpio tatted on her tummy
I'm sitting slouched back in the chair stuntin waving money
And shorty start zig zaggin a derrière for me
A bowlegged dairy-breaded said her name was strawberry
Up - pushed in a whole lotta want more
Reached in my pocket grabbed a G and then threw it on the floor
Here you deserve this dough
Now jump on stage and work the pole
Face down - up - hands on those
Now pop that - you know the procedure
If you want this cash got to make that ass shake like a seizure
Either magic or pleasers
Find me spending cheese up
Maxin out my visa
Trickin on strip teasers

Bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game
Now desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims
Can't get in the spotlight for NOTHIN and it just makes 'em insane
That's why some of the niggaz resort right back to bakin that 'caine
And sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain
As they grow older they'll be feelin a lot of achin and pain
So right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang
And you ain't helpin the process out by always cakin these dames
But it is hard givin up the place where they be shakin they thangs

Survival of the fittest, either stick or get stuck
Get ya game on playa, get ya game on (what?!)

Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)

Let it rush through your veins, cause I'ma be the one
to step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin pool at the Luda-plex; I slap a hundred on the table
just to see if any fools wanna do it next
I got games galore, I got game for sure
And when I win I spit game to whores (yep)
Or double it back, I'll double the stacks
Throw a dub, a big face or double the stack (boy)
And we can 'bout anything that you wanna do
But come up short and OH THE THANGS that the gun'll do
Throw in the towel cause I'm makin 'em sweat
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
So hurry up and come get some, if you want some
You know the phrase - scared money don't make none!
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
Throw some money on the books, cause I know how to call 'em
Somebody tell my fam I got a gamblin problem
I don't know when to STOP, maybe when somebody's
drug away by the COPS, or when I'm blowin steam
Countin green in the DROP, because whether legal or illegal
all my people bring the strength to the block
Yessir, I thought you knew it, we loco
We'll bet on anything, just to see if anybody's gon' do it
It's people livin they LIFE comin up off change
And hustlers payin they bills comin up off games
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
They call me Mr. Put-Down-Two-And-Pick-Up-Six
Then walk away with a clean slate; catch me out in A.C.
Callin yo' bluff with Puff eatin cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
I'm up in Vegas with a stack of black chips
Breakin the whole casino and doin backflips, man
Cameras eyein us, sidebetters tryin us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buyin us
Tryin to get me off my grind, but it won't work
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
I'm still breakin 'em, and dice still shakin 'em
I'll step in any place, just ask X what I say to 'em

Whats the deal people?!
It's the Natural Disaster: T-Storm comin? at you with another hip-hop spotlight.
Since the success of being a radio air personality from back in the day
and later goin' on to release his independent album,
Ludacris has inspired other radio jocks to persue careers in Hip-Hop.
Meet Rob Quarters, a 62-year-old air personality from WZZZ in Bus County Georgia.
I was granted the opportunity to holla at Mr. Quarters about his upcoming album
And here's what he had to say.
(Rob Quarters)
People keep askin? ?why Rob Quarter, why Rob Quarter, 62-year-old motherfuckin g??
Wanna make an album, that's all.
You know, I been, I've been thinking about doin? this shit since, you know, back when I was forty, so I figured ?hey fuck it. Ima go ahead and just do the damn thing,
just go ahead and do the damn thing.?
So, here's the first single off my new album ?Get Hard, Or Die Tryin??
Ya'll feel that? Feel that nigga.
It's called ?Viagra Has Been Good To Me?

Hey, ya'll holla back at a motherfucker and you know what I'm always sayin nigga:
If you can't earn no motherfuckin? cents, you better beg for the quarter.

Chorus:
I'm stuck in between a rock and a hard place
Bad luck is what results from my paper chase
I keep looking it ain't no dough
So I don't wanna look no mo what
(repeat)
I need to get away to another day or place in time
And find where reality can ease my mind
And shine on me like the sons of the earth
For what it's worth my turf is ruff and rugged so I gave birth
To a dream where cream lies between
All the dirt and the gravel so I battle to achieve my green
And still try to move forward at a steady pace
Cause bad luck is interfering with my paper chase
So I erase the crime lies and sad cries
Wit sore eyes and keep mines on the uprise
But it don't work cause im steady getting jerked
By my neighborhood up to no good where bad niggas lurk
The urk me leaving effects that's too negative
So Ludacris is looking for a better place to live
And I can't stand it it's really got me buggin
It's like im in the war and I just keep on tuggin cause i'm

I try to find a way outta this maze
It's got me crazed im in a daze
So many ways to boost into a different phase
But I can't think I can't do nothing
You think I'm fronting
You hear me grunting
Lord you ain't even saying nuttin
I need some currency before there's an emergency
Forget crimes I won't let my mind get the best of me
It's not gone happen I'm trapped in two worlds
On one side I see diamonds on the other I see pearls
It's a whirlwind disaster with two damn sides
So I'm gone with the wind and come right back with the tide
Cause I keep my eyes on the skies and my head in the clouds
And when my mouth is shut up it makes my thoughts get loud
It's like a crowd in a stadium
Mils I be craving em
Money making schemes locked up in my cranium
Cause I need outta this critical situation
My mind's in jail I don't know the time that it's facing I'm

I'm sick of knockin I'm sick of clocking
I'm sick of droppin in a hole never reaching my goal
It's got my soul seperated into pieces
It just increases
I'm hit wit anger like a cooked tit wit hot greases
So if you understood my attitude
Maybe you feel what I'm feeling
And then it start appealing
To ya intellect and aspect of dreams and aspirations
Death by temptations even got my heart basting
So I'm tracing the line where I can find a better path
And make it last sit back and laugh before the aftermath
The tragic flaw is what makes it raw
So let it fall and I'll get through it even if I have to crawl
My way, I see the sun and there's no delay
And I'ma pray cause the lord will make a brighter day
Or will he keep me in his holding cell
But enough wit the questions the only story to tell

I dont know how many cells is left in my fuckin' brain,
But Ima keep on writtin and

And tell the hood that I hire Niggaz and Fire crackers,

Chorus:
Fuck you (8x's)(Im screwed up)

Fuck a 9-to-5 cause Im always gettin rest,

Pimpin aint dead, but I leave you niggaz dead from all this pimpin',

Chorus:
Fuck you (8x's)(Im screwed up)
Ludacris:
All substances thats controlled thats how this story goes,

The potency is so strong if you notice me I'M CALM,
Cool and collected and if you disrespected then
Chorus:
Fuck you (8x's)(Im screwed up)
Lil' Flip:
We doin' this for the playas that bang screw music,
We dont pass out after 8 blunts(Why), because we use to it,
Me and Cris like chee-chee-chong,
So hurry bring out the weed and the bones
Cause if it aint Grade-A-Trees, we gotta leave it alone
And to my homie screw, you know I gotta hold it down
And if they want it then they gotta come and take the crown
Chorus:
Fuck you (8x's)(Im screwed up)
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Haaa,
So there you have it
Sendin this one out to all my drankers,
And all my smokers,

and if you wanna pass the sobriety rebel out
and test this ***** ****** ******* **** ****
Keep bustin got damnit,
and whoever said niggaz in the south cant rhyme
Fuck you (8x's)(Im screwed up)

Hey, yeah! I want all you proud sistas to stand up
I want everybody to stand up and be counted tonight
Brothers and Sisters if you know you got your thing together
I want you to stand on up, now I got somethin' to tell ya'
I told ya' how to think about it, now I want to tell how to get the thing together
So come on now and get up to it yall
[Verse 1]
The incredible, untouchable nigga spittin' venom out his body wit' the dopest flows
And wonder why the line's around the corner
Cuz the little motherfucker has the dopest shows
So one time for my independant women and all the single mothers who be gettin' that cake
Two times for my dawgs pullin' triggers
And my niggaz in the kitchen that be flippin' that weight
East coast, west coast, midwest, dirty south
Then we took it all around the world
I got fans in retirement homes, to teenagers, to little bitty boys ans girls
Droppin' lyrical bombs up in ya' hood,
Non-stoppin', I'ma hit 'em till the block explode
Hip hop, R&B, Pop-tart, what you want?
I even got a little rock 'n' roll
The most creative, original, got 'em takin' subliminal
[Boom boom] cuz they cant get what I gots
They want it so bad, four million dollar pad
And enough to retire off two albums, gone, wave ya' white flags, I'm hot!
And everytime I rhyme I'm puttin' rappers in the ground
Wit' lines that got 'em hooked like dope
They gotta make up they mind, because they runnin' outta time
And I'm about to make 'em choke
Better turn your stereo louder, listen up and let me preach
Let's get arrested for Disturbin' the Peace! (C'mon)
Man! This Disturbin' Tha Peace shit gettin' on my nerves
Boy I tell you the truth, know what I'm sayin'?
While he doin' shows, I'm in these skreets, know what I'm sayin'?
While he on tv, I'm in these skreets
And then my broad, my kid walkin' around singin' it
Boy, if they sing another verse, boy I swear
Know what I'm sayin'? I'm on another level though
I gotta car wash, I gotta shop on O' National
I got my own record label, you heard of us
The Posse Family Cartel, you know what I'm sayin', we real
Who this nigga thing he is?
[Verse 2]
I'ma house hold name, wit' game spittin' outta my mouth at all times
I spit it out and about, and spit outta the south,until they recognize the danger signs
So feel a tingle in yo' s-spine, by the way I talk
And it's pimpin' in my blood, you can tell by the way I walk
Ooh lawd, more styles than a barber shop, call the cops
People in the way wanna baller block
Little do they know that I'm callin' shots
And I'm not to be fucked with
If you see me comin' 'round the corner, then duck quick, perpetrators can suck dick
I tried to tell 'em, but they dont wanna listen
I tried to shine 'em, but they dont wanna glisten, while the high hat keeps on tickin'
And the kick drum keep on pumpin', I'm dumpin' on the closest fools
Cuz rules were made to be broken, but you cant make broken rules
Hear what I'm sayin' or heard what I said
Hear what they playin', cuz thru this music I'ma still be heard if I'm dead
Call ya' producers, cuz I'm hurtin' these beats
I said it once, I'll say it twice, biatch, Disturbin' Tha Peace
C'mon
Yeah, folk
The King of the kings has spoken
ATL shawty! Hood to hood, block to block
We bouta let our nuts hang!
Disturbin' Tha Peace!
We dont die, we multiply
We makin Def Jam history

Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits

The MVP, of this rap shit
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER

I got rifles that blow ya below ya bible belt
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
Softer than bitches washin dishes, fool what's the BUSINESS?
I'm already rich, so talk mo' figures (yup)
Spit 30 large for cigars of you hoe niggaz (oww!)
I got gangstas that'll rearrange ya whole face
And put your casket on ice, now that's a cold case (ha!)
Never forget where you come or that block'll bang you
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you, into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the ""Port of Miami""
To keepin it ""Trilla""
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
He's worth eight figures
So young niggaz, boss up
I present to you, Rick Ross, the boss
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said ""We want hustlers""
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Got a Chevy with pictures on it from pitchin crack
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole
Bitch I'm a D-boy, still slingin kilos
I got twenty cars, why exaggerate?
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Love the marble floors, got the Greek pillows
Frontin at awards, real street niggaz
I used to serve shake, now I serve steaks
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass
Big ass face, chop you in your laugh face
Shoot his ass, aim defense is the last case
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
You in a pool of blood, let me see you swim
Hailing from College Park, Georgia
Authorities figured they must have been some sort of mob
Or illegal organization
According to authorities, they made a quarter mil' a week
Selling {?}, they were some high-rollin hustlers

Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support struggle
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)
(White liquor, my nigga stay on line with the blow)
I'm on time with the flow, not a minute nor second late
Ain't no such thing as second place
(And every day I live heavyweight, you niggaz featherweight)
(Fairytale tellin niggaz really need to take a break)
And the estate got a lake for a backyard
(The pool room product put it all on my sacks card)
For real? (Yeah, for real)
I'm ill, I deal, I did, I will

[Luda] Y'knahmean like you just got your paycheck
[Luda] Paid off a car note or somethin

[Luda] Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?
[Ludacris]
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
Just touched down, called up my 8-1-8
fo' a date with some other bust downs
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
I take the breeze, quick break the trees
Feel good as we flippin through the Robb Repo't
My baby momma ain't trippin on child suppo't
[DJ Quik]
Because she can't support that garbage, she should come pay homage
When we pair 'em, we gon' share 'em, when I'm finished we all switch
I ain't really got the time, yo I'm chillin with Luda-
-cris stop and twist the buddha got me feelin like this is it
If we gon' party, we gon' sip, we got a bar
We all in shape, we gon' go far, you can't stop the car
We on the freeway, if you get out you burnt
You woulda thought you woulda learned me when my hair was all permed
I think y'all bullshittin with it dawg
[Chorus]
It's on tonight, get licked, get gone tonight
[KJ] Therefore, in my life, everything's gonna be, alright
G'd up, my mind is freed up
[KJ] From the day, through the night, everything's gonna be, alright

Arabian Spruce, Seagram's bumpy and juice
We used to bag and then truce, we used to sag and get loose
Not the kind of cats that would jump in your bag for your jewels
But to put some money in it for your drink and your shoes
We get the News like MTV, every ten to the hour
We play Mario Brothers, we eat the 'shroom and get power
Now eat your sour powers, and use your dental floss
What does bein mental cost? If you ain't knowin you already lost
[Ludacris]
So stay with me, and let's get tipsy
Rememberin the days on the block sippin whiskey
Runnin 'round grinnin, runnin 'round sinnin
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Record blowed up, so my hood throwed up
Now let's break loose cause your boy's around
And tonight we gon' celebrate bein allowed riiiiight
[Chorus]
[Ludacris]
It's just one of those days, without a care in the world
You ain't gotta look mean, I know you care for your girl
But she's lookin this way and I'm gonna come get her
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
Just a straight house party and some meat on the grill
[DJ Quik]
If it's Los Angeles, watch a boss handle biz
I'ma put this on my kids, stupid it's an outfit
If you ain't been around the world keep yo' mouth zipped
Cause I do {?} elevation
You see I'm not normal and I'm not a homo
I'm mo' apt to shoot a porno with you in cornrows
And call it ""More Hoes: Volume 5, Volume 6""
And show it in the back of my truck, at the picnic

I'm young, wild, and strapped like Chi-Ali
BLAOW, we ain't got nothing to worry about
Whoop ass, let security carry them out
Watch out for the medallion my diamonds are wreckless
It feels like a MIDGET is hanging from my necklace
I pulled up with a million trucks
Looking, smelling, feeling like a million bucks, ahh!
Pass the bottles, the heat is on
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
What's wrong?!, the club and the moon is full
And I'm looking for a THICK, young lady to pull
One sure shot way to get them out of them pants
Take note to the brand new dance
Like this
[Chorus: Ludacris] + (Shawnna)
[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Go on with your big ass, let me see something
Tell your little friend he can quit mean mugging
I'm lit and I don't care what no one thinks
But where the FUCK is the waitress at with my drinks?!
My people outside and they can't get in
We gone rush the back door & break them in
The owner already pissed cause we sort of late
But our time and our clothes got to coordinate
Most girls looking right, some looking a mess
That's why they spilling drinks all over your dress
But Louis Vuitton bras all over your breasts
Got me wanting to put hickies all over your chest
Ahh!, come on we gone party tonight
Y'all use mouth to mouth bring the party to life
Don't be scared, show another part of your life
The more drinks in your system, the harder the fight!
[Chorus: Ludacris] + (Shawnna)

Stand up! stand up!

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Now, uh, me and Luda wasn't good at computers
So we dropped out of school cause we tried to fuck the tutor
Her ex man drove a Mercury Cougar
I hit him with this maneuver he just couldn't recooper
We got vouchers to stand on these couches
James Brown couldn't tell me, ""get down!""
We got foreign cars and houses
We got porno stars and spouses
You trying to stab one like Jack The Ripper
Trying to get two like Jack ""The Tripper""
My nigga Tony been locked for a minute
He come home from the street he gone want those strippers
And I'm a big tipper I don't even be tripping
This my first real role, XL don't even be ticking
This my first pair of earrings I can wear in the shower
Without clouding up in a half an hour
So that basically mean my paper getting mean
Four G's in a paper denim jeans
The pink rocks real hot like Anthony Keys
To see this Jesus the sweetest of detest
We FIRE, y'all RETIRE
All ugly people please!, be quiet!
Over get a beat from me in a minute
He heard ""Just to Get By"" and I was rehired
I got a track right now that could save miles
It ain't a song, it's a video called Dave Meyers
Y'all drop 20 G's on the Sprewell rims
I give that money to another to get some real spins
[Chorus: Ludacris] + (Shawnna)
[Outro: Ludacris] + (Shawnna)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (yeah)
Stand up! (uh) stand up! (uh)
Stand up! (just like that?)

Like all these fakin ass rappers in this industry
Talkin bout what they got, and they dont got a damn thang
How you own three cars, but you dont own ya own name
Get your business right boys, the first class is in session
Get an entertainment lawyer in the music profession
Start up ya own company, trademark the name
Thats gunna run you bout a grand so start savin ya change
Open a bank account quick, and then follow these steps
Sign yourself to yourself, and start signin ya own checks
Hit the booth and start recordin at the speed of need
Whatever gets ya juices flowin, could be speed or weed
Get it mixed and mastered, pressed up and plastered
Sell it to ya whole hood, out the trunk ya bastard
Show all the non believers what you destined to be
And in just a couple years, you could be rich like me

See mostly all ya favorite artists got some serious problems
The money could be the problem but money cant solve 'em
Some get addicted to drugs and flat out lazy
Some taste a little fame and go flat out crazy
Im close cause those close wanna live off my fame
And that type of shit alone will drive a nigga insane
Not to mention all the vultures, the scandaless promoters
Crabs will try to sue ya, magazines will misquote ya
Most of these label heads they dont care nothin about ya
If ya stop sellin records, they'll act like they dont know ya
Its hard mixin business with pleasure, so dont play
Me and my crew argue and fight like every other day
Rappers aint above the law but our life is so fast
That we got a special task force of police on our ass
All that and this really just a start of it
Hip-Hop you really wanna be apart of it
[Chorus x2]
What's worse than havin no money, is havin it and losin it
What's worse than havin some money, is grabbin and abusin it
We never took no money from Chingy, thought i was cool with em
I wish his ass well, but i dont want nothin to do with em
Some don't own they publishin, me i dont fool with em
Im down for my artist, try my best to stay true to em
Cause outside my label, competition is irrelevant
Unless im still in competition with my president
And believe that Im supportin the hova
Cause the industry, Shady it needs to be taken over
But the first rule to accumulation the wealth
Is dont trust nobody but ya goddamn self

Go spread the word, run and tell all the boys
It's time to play, or better yet brand out the toys; we goin'
[Chorus]
[Dolla Boy]
I'm in a SS Super Sport, with the Four Fifty Four
.45th on the seat, don't get yourself supersoaked
Dependin' on the weather, it may vary - whatever though
Catch me slammin' Escalade, Cadillac, to Chevy do's
And hope I don't, and pull out the Range Rover
The color of coke and snow, I blew out the brains on ya
Blew out the game on em', became a misfit
Shame on a nigga, the 726s wouldn't fit
I'm ridin', I'm high, and I'm glidin, I'm lyin',
I'm flyin', I'm doin 190, it's gon cost to catch us
You see that these diamonds are shinin', and blingin'
and blindin', so let me remind ya it's gon cost to catch up
Who's next up? - That's us, flow leave you breathless
Pedal to the flo', truck seat won't let up
But if you out ridin' deuces or better
Slow down so them girls can't sweat ya, and let the car go
[Chorus]
[Bridge 4X: Titi Boi] + (Dolla Boy)
Assign your name in the skreet (sign your name in the skreet)
[Tity Boi]
I got two miles an hour, so everbody see me
Twenty fours, twenty sixes, twenty eights!
And my rims so big, you would think that is was 3D
Wait' til you see my paint, I ride around the A,
With 'bout half a tank; I'm startin' to make so much money,
I work half a day - I got cash in the safe
I got cash right here, I'm hard to get my swipe on
And I look like a chandalleur with all this ice on
Pull out the (?) shoot
Catch me blowin' out kush of the roof of the seven deuce
Ridin' hella hoes (hella!) elevador do's (hella)
Gator on the seat (And?) mink on the flo's
If a hater wanna creep, I got that thing by the do'
And if my chirp go beep, then my thang gon' blow
Playaz Circle - Titi Boi ridin' on skinny wheels
Bout to trade in the Quarter til eight, and get the ten till
[Chorus] - repeat 2X

Plus she says her life is too hard
She says that she wanna come and build with the God
Promise that she gon' play her part
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
And, she's damn fine, feet Hammertime, damn if I mind
Love is the bu-bubblin back of your waistline
I don't waste time, gotta GET GET ON IT
Just you and me, two glasses, sip on Patron and
in the club scene where I met Ms. Green Eyes
She walked by askin me, ""Are you Nas?""
Why? ""If you was I'd be totally twi""
What's that? ""Totally with it, T.W.I.""
Ha ha, well, here I am, yep I'm the man

So, here we standin before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem

When I stepped up in the club even my arms was shinin

I put my necklace in her face and told her read the chain
Oooh ooh, so stuck up, told me shut the fuck up
BLAOW! Ludacris in the ho-oooh-ouse
The needle hit the record, they was playin this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was EH EH ON
Live forever like Fame, let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back chillin in my b-boy stance
Could be a little pop lockin if your girl's top droppin
But watch for cockblockin on my coochie stock options
But later for the ASSDAQ, throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip swap Nasty N-A-S pass that
honey in the black cause I'm feelin her curves
He looked down at what I had and said WA WA WORD
Why only serve one when we can serve up two
Then at the bachelor's pad, doin what the Virgos do
And these women so shy but get loud undercover

DTP we got them guns that go...
[I-20]
Yea I'm all about that pistol playa, cold blooded killa
Niggaz recognize my name,
I dub the young dealer
You better tell ya man that with the gages I'm nice
Ill shoot up yall white shirts until yall look like dice
But I'm through with all the talking time to show all you niggaz
I 2-0, I'm like J-Lo...going through niggaz
DTP we aint playing if you try to get our pen
A.K's get ta spraying like...
Bottom line that mean I'm bout it, any nigga want it, doubt it
Bust you in the broad day, on a street that's fully crowded
Find a hole inside your chest, just for thinking its rap
And tell that pretty bitch thug we got some pretty big gats
Chaka say I'm shot out, and I tend to agree
So you should watch what you saying if it's intended for me
So be careful what you starting, let my fingers do the walking
And that Uzi get to talking like...
[Tity Boi]
Hammers, jam 'em, snatch 'em, grab 'em
Can the an and fuck 'em, damn 'em
Press him, man him, scared him, teared him, kneed him up
Bake him, take him, beat him up, I hate I hate, I eat him up
A-B-C-E-F shawty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach and throwing them bitches up like earl
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle...
And I'm throwing te'hs like a NBA ref
I got, all gold guns like they came from I-RAQ
Artillery, could it be I got all kinds of these pistols
I point my gun at ya homeboy make ya own folks hit ya
And aint taking no more pictures, if you snap ima click
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm webbing choppers like heli-copters
You gon' need hella doctors, when the glok go...
[Chingy]
Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip that text be quick
20 over thurr, Tity over thurr, Luda over thurr, aint no exit trick
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks
Reload with the next clip, I'm the wrong nigga to flex with bitch
Come on and test this, my gun I'm having sex with shit
Put a bullet in (in) shoot it out, got them long horns like Texas bitch
Look at my necklace, maybe hit a nigga disrespect this click
My pistol grip sound like this...now what
Who want that they fucked, when I cock and load the cake, bust bust
Yall cowards play tough, and my peeps we come to spray stuff up
Yall lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
I'm wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone
So thurr for you should invest, in a vest for ya dome
Cause I know you marks planning on getting me when I'm landing
Beast the nick, but my cannon go...
[Ludacris]
Fuck a medic, we gon' call yo ass a taxi cab
Bleedin so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month
A.K. 47 for the niggaz who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
Got killaz in my squad and I'm the nicest one in my group
But I got bananas for you niggaz and I aint talking bout fruit
Ill pay your CAB BACK with the BLACK MACK
Till your BACK CRACK, cock the GAT BACK like...CLAK CLAK CLAK
Swallow a hallow make 'em digest with a 50 caliber
Yo futures not looking so good, tomorrows not on your calendar
I, do away with the amateurs, they breathing too long
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
My Shotguns are cold and hard, but my Desert is easy
And my triggers are always talking about some squeeze me, squeeze me
And for these fakers talking greezy, I'm starting the show
My Uzi got a drum roll, it goes...

Yeah, Welcome to Atlanta, jack and hammer and vogues'
Back to the mackin' and jackin' the clothes, adolescent packin a fo'
A knock on the do', who is it?
I wouldn't happen to know, the one with the flow
Who did it?, it was me I suppose
J-D in the Rollz and Luda's in the Cutt Supreme
Skatin down old Nat, Gat tooked and lean
I split ya spleen, as matter' fact I split ya team
No blood on the sneak's, gotta keep it so my kicks is clean
I get the cream, cops see me flick my beams
Im allergic to 'doc perscribed anti-histemines
Oink Oink, Pig Pig, do away with the pork
Only silverware i need's a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, Im loose with banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when i shoot the cannon
The Wooley mammoth saber-tooth, bitch bite your tounge
I wont stop until Im rich as them white-boy come
I pull up in the black Lotus, you're plaque's are bogus
So I stripped them off the wall
Waiting for my cue to corner pocket eight balls
You rackin' 'em up, Im big paper like pancakes, stackin' 'em up
In fact Im slappin' 'em up, Caddillac is a truck
I cant lose with 22""s, Bitch thats whats up
Runnin in the back the fuck, runnin better than aquaduct
chil-li-li-li-li-n.. what

Welcome to Atlanta where the playas play
And we ride on them things like every day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsta's roamin'
And parties dont stop til' eight in the mornin'

Welcome to Atlanta where the playas play
And we ride on them things like every day

Now the party dont start 'til I walk in
And I usually dont leave until the thing ends
But in the mean-time, in between time
You work yo thing, I'll work mine
I been puttin' it down here since 83'
Since the late show MD rivalry
More froze than bad ice, with a place to be
If you was ridin, you was ballin to homie Shadi
Im the MBP, Most Ballingest Player
Make my own rules, bitch call me the mayor
Monday night, Gentlemen's Club
Tuesday night, Im up in the velvet room, gettin fucked up
Wednesday, Im at strokers on lean
Thursday, jump clean, and I fall up in cream
Friday, shark or kyack with Frank Skeem,
right on the floor is where you can
find me
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy,
you can find me up in one-tweezy
Sunday, is when i get my sleep in
Cause on Monday we be at it again, Holla!

With all models I make I'm +Great+ like five +Lakes+
You got rims on ya truck? Man I got rims in my skates!
You rollin on dubs, I roll right into clubs
Dirtiest home with more rings than ya tub
You think it's all practical jokes and big bloopers
But I smack bitches with no titties that work at Hooters
Just get a couple of girls that shakin they thangs
Then I, put 'em on camera and cut two frames
With some gasoline drawers I'll be goin to hell
Ludacris, fuck like a nigga fresh out of jail!
I got junkyard dawgs, I'm rowdier than Rod Piper
And my baby's assed out, cause I rub my cars with her diapers
So you can pray for now if you sinned in the past
""Word of Mouf"" time to wipe that silly grin off yo' ass
[4-Ize]
These rap cats is soft like R&B singers
It's 4-Ize, I've worked for wings and chicken fingers
I reps mo' parts so Chi-Town could get seen
I'm a Dirty Bird now but I keep shit clean
I rip meanface niggaz one by one
or two by two, I'll take 'em however they come
Instead of a gun, I'll pull out a stick from woodworkin
The black Hacksaw Jim Duggin stay lurkin
Creepin, I'm in the shadows, the nightshade
You want the tail in the back or, a light fade?
Cause Tony Scissorhands is the barber, the butcher
I kill ya smoke a blunt and forget where I put ya
I'm Soopafly like Snuka, I smack hoes
The black rose with the dozen attack flows
I rock Shaq's clothes when I alter beast
Power up, get big, it's Disturbin' Tha Peace

We gon' handle this like grown men, you won't win
You ain't even comfortable in your own skin
I rap my ass off, fighting the champ with a glass jaw
In the Garden or Nassau
See me, couple hood niggas behind stars
I hear you put a couple good niggas behind bars (Preme!)
I might never sell that much
But you can bet your last two quarters I'll never tell that much
Picture 'Kiss not come out swingin'
That's like seeing 50 at a show and he don't come out singin'
Yeah you got a felony but you ain't a predicate
Never the King of New York, you live in Conneticuit
You don't be in the hoods, you be in the woods
Fuckin' with me its where you really gonna be for good
I hold a four-five myself
Hop out the Range on one-four-five myself
This is a true fact
Since when has become cool to get shot and not shoot back
Trackmasters shelved you, Bravehearts helped you
Then everybody felt, now I gotta melt you
And don't try to pull rank on 'Kiss
Cause the niggas I'mma send to do it ain't gon' miss
Be laid up stiff, I spit straight up piff
I did real songs with Big, no made up shits
And I don't have a problem with clout
You aint get shot again yet,
so whats your second album about? (Nothing)
Your raps are preschool
You made a lot money, now be cool
Before I swell up your lips like seafood
Can I get a mic check?
You don't stand a chance at the dance with me dogs
You steps ain't right yet
The Block is just fine, home the D's straight
Most likely your new CD is a weed plate
A bunch of love songs
One hundred precent pure garbage
Just something to break up buds on
You should just sell clothes and sneakers
Cause out of your whole camp, your flows the weakest
I'm in the town where the young boys is clappin'
You running around town with the Lieutenant and Captain
It'd take a life time to see 'Kiss
You had to get shot nine times to be rich
Rat ass nigga youse an animal, youse a motherfucking animal
Pig ass nigga youse an animal, youse a motherfucking animal
Snake ass nigga youse an animal, youse a motherfucking animal
Matter fact, you ain't no animal
I'mma show these motherfuckers how to handle you

The money that pass my hand and the rocks I chop
The ammo, the artillery, the knifes I bought
Waking up sore the next day from fights I fought
In the hood cuz I fuck wit the thugz
Tryin to figure out, why the money never added up to the love
Gun in my waist, dutch in my hand

Stays hot, I ain't got to get my buzz back
What everybody trying to be now; I was that
They could never stop me; that's why I love rap
Been living the life, praising ice.
Bang the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread, all the whips is a year ahead
I only fear the FEDs
Forty-five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank; call it a free throw
Funny, 'cause I had divisions since Calico
Back then, I still ain't reached my peak, though
Louie loafers, Pollo pea coat
Call me whenever the bosses meet, yo
I drove papi crazy, so the industries never gonna stop me, baby
I'm gonna call it confidence, 'cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing: They can't stop me
Whether I'm on ""Ef"" or LA, or they swap me;
it's all good, because I know the gangsters got me
First thing's first ""they jar us"" abruptly
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one they can't guard me properly
But when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milligrams of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knockneed
Got too hot for the grams, and got weed
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six; quick to blow three
Audio heroin, so you don't OD
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy, can't stop me, baby
Once I start I ain't gonna stop the squeezing
And the gauze ain't gon' be able to stop the bleeding
And your girl ain't gon' be able to stop the weezing
When she get that phone call from the doc; we even
You could not stop me, so stop believing
Ring tone rap, this is not the season
I punch lines hard enough to stop your breathing
And the ladies will still pay a lot to see him
I'm gonna get rich long as I got my freedom
And usually when you get hit it's for a reason
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds, and
watch your Qs, and be on your Ps, and
Thank you all for coming out this evening
Having a good time with your liquor, and treason
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me
They still wouldn't be able to stop me

It's dat real
Yo, why is Jadakiss as hard as it gets
Why is the industry designed to keep the artist in dept
And why them dudes ain't ridin' if there part of your set
And why they never get it poppin' but they party to death
Yea, and why they gon give you life for a murder
Turn around only give you eight months for a burner, it's goin down
Why they sellin' niggaz CD's for under a dime
If it's all love daddy why you come wit your nine
Why my niggaz ain't get that cake
Why is a brother up North better than Jordan
That ain't get that break
Why you ain't stackin' instead of tryin' to be fly
Why is rattin' at an all time high
Why are you even alive
Why they kill Tupac n' Chris
Why at the bar you ain't take straight shots instead of poppin Crist'
Why them bullets have to hit that door
Why did Kobe have to hit that raw
Why he kiss that whore
Why

Is this thing that I've been living
They got me in the system
Why they gotta do me like that
Try'd to make it my way
But got sent up on the highway
Why, oh why
Why they do me like that
[Jadakiss]
Why would niggaz push pounds and powder
Why did bush knock down the towers
Why you around them cowards
Why Aaliyah have to take that flight
Why my nigga D ain't pull out his Ferrari
Why he take that bike
Why they gotta open your package and read your mail
Why they stop lettin' niggaz get degreez in jail
Why you gotta do eighty-five percent of your time
And why do niggaz lie in eighty-five percent of they rhymes
Why a nigga always want what he can't have
Why I can't come through in the pecan Jag
Why did crack have to hit so hard
Even though it's almost over
Why niggaz can't get no jobs
Why they come up wit the witness protection
Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least
[Chorus]
[Jadakiss]
Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a ""why lie I need a beer"" sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all my old ones
That's why

First things first
When a nigga money ain't right
That makes things worst
Now he's just breathing he can barely manage
And he's way past starvin
He's really famished
His right-hand man is up north, that's hurtin em
His cellphone bout to cut off, spring jerkin em
And his baby moms startin to do her thing again
She left him for a nigga pumpin e up in Bengaltin
If his money is right than maybe he can diss her
But he can't, and niggas is breakin his little sister
His pops just past
His mom use to be an occasional sniffer
Then she started fuckin with the gas
Dude use to be a star back then
He had the benz CL something
But he just turned his car back in
Mad carrots pawned all his rings
Took this thing next thing I know
Money pawned all his bling
Now he just like everybody
With the same old plans
That can't get over the hump
With the same old grams
They was on the block making fun of him
He slid off came back with his hammer and killed everyone of em

Cause when I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When I come through clear it out,
Play the sideline and observe how a real nigga air it out
When i come through clear it out
Play the sideline and observe
Me and B.I go man to man
I know niggas with an asshole
Full of parole that go hand in hand
Fuck hot thats humidity
And you can't mix money with stupidity
Even though I get my coke from Columbia
My cars from Germany
And my guns from Sicily
Nothin personal but I was raised different
Hold my joint sideways so I blaze different
Give it to anybody fuck an age difference
From those in the world to those in the ca****
Rub the kite on your chest and swallow the stamp
At the end of the day they still gonna follow the champ
It ain't about being lyrical
Cause when I get in the booth
I make miracles and I ain't stared at you
But I'm in tune with the hood so I'm better than you
And when you see me comin you know what is better to do

Can't lie all I got is my balls and my vocals
And the only security I roll wit is my social

And went on the rode with the presint
Had it up to here with this fake shit
They don't even want a nigga to earn his
Just give and take shit
Just make sure you mention my name in da top brackets
And make sure you mention your name as the top faggot
Trust me this go around I will not have it

Top of the food chain, It's just the way that I do things
The dungaree seats in the blue Range
I'm working with new change, a Gemini nigga with mood swings
had the fiends looking for new things
I stopped playin' with birds and stated playin' with words
the money wasn't right, so I had to stay on the kerb
And I'll be a player later. But for now
Call me pootay 'Kiss, if not that? Montega Jada
I kick hard bars and blow hard weed
and be everywhere, 'cause I move at God's speed
And my aim is to make y'all bleed
Y'all got embarrassed in the class when the teacher used to make y'all read
Uh-huh, Mind over matter
And that's all good but fuck that
My new shit is spine over bladder
And everybody tryin'a get to the top, and that's all good too
but right now - I'm on the ladder
[Chorus]
Look at you then, and (uh-huh)
Look at you now. (yeah)
Don't let this cold cold world,(uh-uhhh)
Bring you down. [x2]
[Verse 2]
I know your queen got her eyes on me
I got my eyes on your queen, The SMG is Heinekken green
Mad thing is you know before long that we gon' get it on
My kit costs thirty and ten to put it on
No tints, windows clean - heavy Windex
gears on the steering wheel, I shift 'em with my index
Real life - it's just in another form
Kiss Of Death, it's about to be another storm
I'm a goddamn raging bull
Stay out of jail by just tellin' myself the cage is full
Got niggaz on the payroll, just to squeeze
You're in no position to challenge my expertise
They get a bonus if they leave you
Old school - from the era of the 45's with the penny on the needle
Boss of the bosses, so please don't violate or cross him
Or you'll be the corpse of the corpses
[Chorus x2]
[Verse 3]
Uh- Huh, You know thw word anger
is just one letter short of the word danger, and I aint no stranger
Never use a gat more than twice if you don't clean it
and never say fuck something if you don't mean it
And when it comes to life, the route you've been using thus far aint working right?
Take the scenic
Whatever faith you got, put in a crook
Wanna hide something from a nigga? Put it in a book
Trust me, this album, the vapour's gon' go around
If you aint hot, you need paper to throw around
Yeah, it's getting clearer every day
When you wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say
[Chorus x2]

I'll always find a way
I love you too much, to loose ya
Sweet touches, you're there right by
[VERSE 1:]
(By your side)
It makes me strong
It gives me the strength to bang out and make these songs
If I do it on the spot or if it takes me long they can't stop me
Even if my breaks was on
I'm still...
(By your side)
I'm always here, nobody's perfect
Life ain't always fair
I used to not give a fuck
I ain't always care when it's too hot for the hammer
You know the hawk is right?
(By your side)
Until you get to the car
And you gotta get through the D before you get to the R
If I don't get you today then I'ma get you tomorrow
As soon as you come out your crib I'ma be right?
(By your side)
Where I'm supposed to be
Close to you, with the toast close to me
And screw it if it's the right or wrong thing
When you in the sight of that long thing
You wish you had a strong team right?

As long as you need me
I'm down for whatever hommie as long as you feed me
I pull the big joints out as long as the TV
Or I can play my part and just breathe easy right?
(By your side)
As soon as something happen to you
Your n*****s would bounce and you thought they were scrappin? witcha you
Now you cleanin? your cuts with peroxide
And you wake up in the ER with the Doc right?
(By your side)
Puttin? tubes in you and you can't even eat right
They puttin? food in you
Your body's getting colder
Devil on your shoulder
And you Mom's in the room but you just wanna hold her?
(By your side)
Nothin? but realness
That's why everybody in the world could feel this
I'm on top and ya'll under me
So when it's over; if I ain't in the front, atleast I'm gonna be?

[VERSE 3:]
Until they finish me off
If they don't get us both you'll be sending me off
And please just do me this favor
Stick to our little plan
And f*ck the money
Just keep my little man?
(By your side)
And show ?em there's hope
And he gon? think he knows whats going
But show him the ropes
And if you bring him to the Gucci store
Show him the loffs hood n*****s I'm just showing you growth
But I'm still right?
(By your side)
You know Kiss don't gotta aim his gun at you to be focused
And if you broke now n***a when you see those chips
Watch how many people come out of nowhere
And try to be?
(By your side)
The answer's plenty
Cause when you handling business you can't be friendly
And if you tryna stack something
Can't be pennies
Most likely grants and benggies
And you better keep ?em?

Stays hot, I ain't got to get my buzz back
What everybody trying to be now; I was that
They could never stop me; that's why I love rap
Been living the life, praising ice.
Bang the baddest chicks in the world, maybe twice
The swag, the gear, the bread, all the whips is a year ahead
I only fear the FEDs
Forty-five on the other side of the peep hole
Head shot from point blank; call it a free throw
Funny, 'cause I had divisions since Calico
Back then, I still ain't reached my peak, though
Louie loafers, Pollo pea coat
Call me whenever the bosses meet, yo
I drove papi crazy, so the industries never gonna stop me, baby
I'm gonna call it confidence, 'cause I ain't cocky
I just know one thing: They can't stop me
Whether I'm on ""Ef"" or LA, or they swap me;
it's all good, because I know the gangsters got me
First thing's first ""they jar us"" abruptly
I treat the rap game like a large monopoly
One on one they can't guard me properly
But when they double team me the odds are sloppy
I move like them eighty milligrams of oxy
Send your sister back to your family knockneed
Got too hot for the grams, and got weed
In the rap bracket he remains the top seed
Revolver holds six; quick to blow three
Audio heroin, so you don't OD
Shooters know you, but you don't know me
The block is crazy, can't stop me, baby
Once I start I ain't gonna stop the squeezing
And the gauze ain't gon' be able to stop the bleeding
And your girl ain't gon' be able to stop the weezing
When she get that phone call from the doc; we even
You could not stop me, so stop believing
Ring tone rap, this is not the season
I punch lines hard enough to stop your breathing
And the ladies will still pay a lot to see him
I'm gonna get rich long as I got my freedom
And usually when you get hit it's for a reason
If you in the hood, better dodge the Ds, and
watch your Qs, and be on your Ps, and
Thank you all for coming out this evening
Having a good time with your liquor, and treason
Even if they knock me, then continue to watch me
They still wouldn't be able to stop me

Congratulations, homie!
You made history!
1.1 million in a short week! [laughs]
Screw a press conference, press this on your conscience!
D-Block, cheers!
Yeah!
I ain't mad, I don't wanna sound mad, I feel marvelous..
D-Block, Double R, fuckin' faggots..
We gon' handle this like grown men, you won't win
You don't even feel comfortable in your own skin
I rap my ass off, I'm fightin' the champ with the glass jaw
at the Garden or Nassau
See me, couple hood niggaz behind stars
I heard you put a couple good niggaz bars, (Preme!)
I might never sell that much
But you can bet your last 2 quarters, I never tell that much
Picture 'Kiss not come out swingin'
It's like going to see 50 at a show and he don't come out singin'
Yeah, you got a felony, but you ain't a predicate
Never the King of New York, you live in Connecticut
You don't be in the hood, you be in the woods
Fuckin' wit' me, is where you really gon' be for good
I hold the 4-5 myself, and hop out the Range on 1-4-5 myself
This is a true fact
Since when has it become cool to get shot and not shoot back
Trackmasters shelfed you, Bravehearts helped you
Then everybody felt you, now I gotta melt you
And don't try to pull rank on 'Kiss
Cause the niggaz I'ma send to do it ain't gon' miss
Be layed up stiff, I spit straight up 'piph
I did real songs with BIG, no made-up shits
And I don't got a problem with clout
You ain't get shot again yet, so what's your second album about? (Nothin'!)
Your raps are pre-school, you made a lot of money, now be cool
'Fore I swell up your lips like seafood
Can I get a mic check? You don't stand a chance
To dance with me dog, ya steps ain't right yet
Block is just fine, homie, the D's straight
Most likely your new CD is a weed plate
Bunch of love songs, 100% pure garbage
Just somethin' to break up buds on
You should just sell clothes and sneakers
Cause outta your whole camp your flow's the weakest
I'm in the town where the young boys is clappin', (clappin')
You runnin' around with the lieutenant and captain, [laughs]
It'll take a lifetime to see 'Kiss
You had to get shot 9 times to be rich
Rat ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal
Pig ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal
Snake ass nigga, you's a animal
You's a motherfuckin' animal
Matter of fact, you ain't no animal
I'ma show these motherfuckers how to handle you

Album
Submitted by Terronald
Lyrics Huh, uh yeah
Bout to put it to 'em
With some ghetto slick shit, heh
Check it out, one time
For your motherfuckin' mind (motherfuckin' mind)
Yo I'm saying they gon' smell me on this one
No doubt, he-heh
Check it out, oh yeah
Listen
On the cross town with the top down
Sounds banging out the backstreets (alright)
Me and shorty two deep
She's flashing me thighs
Wind blowing through her hair
Baby we can take it there (take it there)
But first I gotta make my rise
Baby slow down
My crib's on the other side of town
But from the look in her eyes
She was hypnotized
Rubbed her hands on my chest
And started getting undressed
Tell me why
Could it be my chromed out rims?
Break your neck when you see me lookin' good
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feelin' me
(that you're feelin' me, feelin' me, feelin' me baby)
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked
Tell me why you just can't stop
I'm thinking that it's all about me
What could it be?
I got the sixty inch flat tv, what?
Got it like DVD, whatever you need
I got the bubbles in the tub with the back rub (bathtub)
Silk sheets baby to make love
Oh girl I wanna hit it in the worst way
After that you'll be coming back like every day (oh yeah)
send you back to your girls with something else to say
How I hit it, split it, had you with it till the break of day
Could it be my chromed out rims?
Break your neck when you see me lookin' good
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feelin' me
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that a nigga got it locked
Tell me why you just can't stop
I'm thinking that it's all about me
What could it be?
Could it be the drop top Benz
That got your friends going out on a limb
Sliding me numbers when you ain't watching them
Playing me close but I'm not feeling them
Could it be the time piece flooded with chips?
You with me cause I flex brigets around my wrist?
Or large amounts up in my bank account
You tell me you love me baby but what's that all about
Could it be my chromed out rims?
Break you neck when you see me lookin' good
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feelin' me
Could it be the word on the block?
I know they told you that I got it on lock
Tell me why you just can't stop
I'm thinking that it's all about me
What could it be?
Could it be my chromed out rims? (could it be my chromed out rims)
Break you neck when you see a nigga dip
Or could it be the ice you see?
But you tell me that you're really feelin' me
Could it be the word on the block? (tell me)

Why take time out, to give you the real me...
Uh, uh, uh
Ayo I grew up very athletic, hard headed
thought I knew everything, wanted to do everything
I was spoiled, stubborn, the only child
so the only thing I could do was hold it down
Now this is something that I could tell you that's no bullshit
I always been wicked with the flow since a lil kid
my first addiction, GI Joes and icies
after that it was light skinned girls and Nikes
breeze through junior high school, then high school
couple of semesters of college and then night school
Moms start riffin, talkin 'bout how she can't support a grown man
so the god start flippin
Pops used to say shit, but never to me much
was like he wasn't even there cuz we aint agree much
used to be gone for whole weeks at a time
puffin one eleven, used to roll three out a dime
then I found myself sleepin in late, doin nothing
fuckin, runnin with the niggas that was hustlin
shop wasn't open then, niggas was workin for a pair of Jordans
the next two weeks they was broke again
me and K keep havin talks of gettin coke again
but the block was crowded we waitin for an openin
meanwhile shit still slow we still flowin
never stop or look back we still goin
Bop passed the demo to Mary then she passed it to cousin
We thought it was on but it wasn't
and we can't blame nobody
look at us now dog, we came in the game nobodies
Double R and Interscope, put that cake up
and we aint go platinum but we made niggas wake up
got 'em all talkin 'bout pumpin the brick
and they only go and see papi to get somethin to sniff
I'm 'bout to fuck the game up for real like in the World Series
nigga that parachute down in the field
I don't rap I provide you bars
and the pain is invisible, but you can't hide the scars
so y'all never be on the level that we're on
ability to have dope thoughts and spit heroin
I'm good just wakin up
That's how I know I got one more chance to go and cash in and cake it up...

Ain't no need in buying a drink or holding a convo
If you ain't coming back to the condo
It's damn near 4 in the morning ain't shit to discuss
Til you ask which dick do you suck
I'm trying to fuck til it's light outside
You feel the same? Get your coat get your friends
The truck right outside
Listen ma I wanna ball out
So when I nut I expect you to suck it all out
And let my man tear your walls out
Cause he just came home and he need pussy to fall out
I get it crump ask the fellow players
Kiss hit more hoes than they list in the yellow pages
It's never to cuff 'em share 'em right after I fuck 'em
To come clean I'm a mellow gangster
Pass a chick like a baton runner to runner
Been through a million thongs from summer to summer
So you'll never see J stressed they always say yes
Everynight dog I be bustin a nut
I just can't stop gettin' the butt
And the only thing I ask girlfriend is we fuckin' or what?

Look if you don't like men be out
And if it's all good and you got a girlfriend then we out
Please don't hit me with the two worse lines
How you don't be doing this or this is your first time
Listen we all grown bitch you came here on your own bitch
I leave them lawsuits alone bitch
She try to tell me she model
I told her me too you ain't saying nothing slick suck it and swallow
I just wanna hit you from the back and watch the Apollo
And if the pussys all that I might holla tomorrow
But you acting like a rabbit how you cling to the carrots
It ain't the bling it's the nigga ma get it and stash it
Caught a coy, caught a flashback check this out
Bring your girlfriend in the room shorty and lick her asscrack
And even though your toungue stuck in her butt
The only thing I wanna know is we fuckin' or what?

shortly after that is when the jealousy sets in then they'll shut it down
It's just raspy nothin on the neck wrist ware just classy
no way I'm letting this money just get past me
When all I had to do in the first place from the beginning was get nasty
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Kartoon]
Niggaz been waitin' for that west coast shit I tell them to go fish
Blowin purple in a purple Laker jersey wit the gold kicks
bitches be like Toon you a mutha fuckin trip
Hop in the whip and lean til that mutha fucka flip
and every club in Cali crackin' its gangsta town
keep a couple of niggaz with me that'll bang you down
now lil mama put switches on and make it jump
before me you needed Lil Jon to make it crunk
naw for real come to Cali player take ya pump
my New York niggaz leave y'all wit razor bumps
now pappa raised a rolling stone I feel like pops
In the absence of Makaveli I feel like Pac
even though I got the deal I still might pop
right in front of the po-po you could feel my shots
man all my niggaz carry bangers we feel like SWAT
and that's the reason why Rialto feel like Watts

Shorty getting it in with me

[Verse 1]
You know me im with a ghetto diva
Stiletto fever, jello shots, yellow reefer
Same rules apply, im back on top
You cant drink or smoke if you not gon pop
See me in the popcorn drop, not gon stop
Taking shots of Petrone, getting top on yachts
From a island to the mountain, rock on rocks
The whole world wanna know, when this lock go drop
Without a doubt, she acknowledge the wealth
Since she aint give brains, I told her let me get some knowledge myself
Then I told her, be proud of yourself, and dig deep
Im trying to see what you can get out of yourself
After all that, I told her to fall back
The Ferrari truck parked in the back, its all black
Next time, bring some friends and more yak
It depends how I feel in the morn? if I call back
[Kanye West]

Now is it just me or do them Ug's, have girls feet looking like sheepskin rugs
Some rhyme witta name, some rhyme nameless
Don't try to treat me like I aint famous
My apologies are you into astrology
Cause, um, im trying to make it to Uranus
See, that's a little Don Juan game
All across your chest like Sean John name
Niggas trynna figure out since Kan came
Who the rookie of the year, me or Lebron James
They say whoa don't get caught up in the hype
Aint no telling if they gon love you after tonight
Well if tonights the night, pop bottles, fuck models
Spend money till your broke, my nigga live your life

She wanna spend with me
She see me roll up the bud, and thug up the club
Cause I got my mens with me
She say she leaving her friends for me
They aint getting in with her, cause she gon bend for me
Her tongue spin like a rim for me, do what she can for me
Look like a 10 for me
Now shorty is out with me, using her mouth with me
She looking out for me

Come on, huh
Come on, yo, yo, yo
Some people blond peeps, red banjies
Some are moving quickly, outta town
How they gonna find her moving swiftly?
Five steps ahead of the best so that's nothing
Twenty steps ahead of the rest they left stuck
And in they face not, what not?
I can't stand broads
Ridiculous niggas practice for the title ""hard""
Me pick of the litter
I was born to bubble y'all
Born to change game shit born to stand guard
Play games you left nameless, fame hard
Promise that it's never painless
Nigga be hard
Convinced that you can take over the Eve
Eat nigga let starve
Strong as a stallion maiden
You better dart
Is she feminine with pretty women friends all dimes!
Timberlands is how I like my men and all minds
Rough ryde you niggas hard head, soft spine
Pass the word
Must have the stacks to cross lines
Come on
[Eve]
Don't want your dough
I don't want your car

Don't want your jewels

Yo a chick is a chick
A nut is a nut
And they always keep an attitude
Till you butter 'em up
Since I ain't gotta buy you stuff
Who gon' hold you down
If they try to run in here and tie you up
Now don't start flippin' it
Everybody know
We've been had dough
Y'all just start gettin' it
Money might make you grown
But you still need a dog to take you home
And make you moan
You ain't gotta see the bank for loans
All I do is party and bullshit like when Frank was home
And you got it all boo I got it all too
A four, five, and a six and they all blue
And I don't care what she think
If I offered you any ice love it'll be in the drink
And instead of talking 'bout what you got and all that
Just make sure when I hit you that you call back
Come on, uh-huh

Yo, yo ay yo
One touch will make a nigga blush on site
Grown men create a crush, nails they bite
It's a game try to catch me but only if you can
It takes a lot to impress the bombshell to want a man
And it ain't about your dough baby Eve alright
Cause if Eve wanna fly away, Eve take a flight
Eve hungry for a meal baby Eve get a bite
You nice and you might get to see it daddy, tight
[Jadakiss]
Yo, yo, yo
I'm glad that you got it all
That's more for me
And I ain't gotta pay for the puss I score for free
And the same thing I pulled on them
I pulled on you
Come on now how you think I pulled your crew?
Got my own crib so you can't kick me out
I'll call one of your friends to come twist me out
If you know Jada then you know what Kiss be 'bout
Just for fun I hit the bank and pull fifty out, uh ah
[Eve](Jadakiss)
Don't want your dough

I put it on her wit the ol' school two step, clap and a spin
Filled up her cup, slid her a dutch
You know what's happenin then (what?) in
And all I did was having a grin
Off top let her know I ain't one of these dudes
Rhyming to lose, naw ma I'm rapping to win
Yeah! yes! They know the God be fresh
I'm on that ass blowing purple on the washing set
And even though I came wit thugs
You still might catch a few of them 'Stepping In The Name Of Love'
Uh! It's D on the Block, the Ryde is Ruff

Gangsta leanin, Kiss be in the bank wit cream and
My wrists and my neck be gleamin
Whatever I got cost, Honey look hotter than Hot Sauce
That's why I get to hop in a drop Porsche
Then she get dropped off, told her that the whole block pop off
She come through, take them rocks off
And therefore, wanna know, what would they stare for
They heard about the work, it's as white as your Air Force
Maybe it's the voice that the world got an ear for
Most of these rappers, I just don't care for
So I be on the honies wit the big ol' asses
Hypno and Cleako in big ol' glasses
We could do the damn thang, order the champagne
Honey's Head of the State, and I'm running the Campaign
If you coming, c'mon, if not I'm gone
Other than that, yo Pharrell, sing my song!

Hey yo, Honey got a goon thinking
That ass like that, she could have the room stinking

Blew her back out until the moon sank in
Spend the profit, hold on the to the re
Lock me up, hold on the to key

Yo, I'm a gangsta, cuz I do gangsta shit

feel good when I walk through the hood
best part is, I don't gotta flow I just talk to the hood
and I do alotta readin, and only eat pasta
shrimp fettucini, and pine a la vaca
came here talkin slick, all that real shit
that's why I'm somethin to deal wit
even though I wanted Gore to win
I can fuck with Bush though, cuz he gon let the raw come in
bigger the boss, bigger the picture
bullets is bisexual, cuz they hit niggas and bitches
in a Deville with dubs in the back on a cell phone riffin

Yo, I'm a thug so I blow on weed

my bitches don't know nothing, don't say nothing
and they pay for everything, I don't pay nothing
I'm a white tee pimp, fresh headband
dirty denim, Timbaland, or a Nike pimp

I ain't flip, I'm just handling my business
And keeping it going

Fuck y'all niggas talkin 'bout huh? [""it's time I see you...]
Get it right, you faggot niggas heard Suge Knight
Double R's the only niggas he respect and, y'all niggas shook right?
y'all get on Hot 97 and, talk wit a baritone
wit two niggas downstairs wit ?licensed guns? to take y'all home
scared ass niggas, you think they gon take a life so they can get life [nope]
ask Puff they aint tryin to hear that nigga
for no cake, and y'all can get at us on Labor Day
we make stones that say ? your moms labor day
I'm in the hood so we can link up, any place you think of
handheld don't hold prints plus I burnt the tip of my fingers
I'm a Bronx gangsta nigga, double R's hoodrat
the nigga they come get quick bitch, on this hood shit
[Cross]
Y'all bitches think the ryders a joke, well I don't play [let's go]
I blow you whole fuckin shit up like Tim McVeigh
gimme the needle, not tomorrow, but today
Cross comin y'all better get the fuck out the way
I aint the shit that you see that's on the top of your church
I put a bomb in your baby carriage, brick through your hearse
[Infa-Red]
Tell your CEO, don't call my CEO apologizin [sorry]
I'm at your wake in the choir standin harmonizin
It's Infa-Red the shit that be on top of the heater
The best thing in New York since Steinbrenner signed Jeter
hold Camby sister the hostage, then send 'em a reef
so stop frontin vegetarian just scared of  beef
[Eve]
Yo, ay suck my dick bitch, the way this chick spit ridickliss
Here we go again, only we on Kiss shit
we comin and you keep runnin
you keep claimin you the best that done it
pussy let me see somethin
fake niggas screamin ""Ryde or Die""
same niggas we run up on and make 'em cry
outta all the camps in this game, nigga
we the champs in this game
who kick the real shit before the fame
fuck you fat ass, fake bad ass niggas
still play the hood while you ride past niggas
coward trust me, we keep it gutter
hope you stay mad a hater cuz you can't touch us, huh
""It's time I see you...""
[Styles]
Ayo, I aint got a care in the world
Kidnappin your kid, maimin your mom, and airin your girl
and like, you aint got a care in the world
I'm hopeless and numb, I can't see but I can focus my gun
and I'm down for smokin blunts to the head
my nerves is shot, my paces is short, I dump in your head
I'm the hardest nigga out you outta know it by now
I'm the nigga that they talk about goin to Chao
and my name ring bells, my blade stay bloody
if you heard about me beefin dog I leave the most shells
the nigga to salute, the quickest to shoot
Holiday Styles, motherfucker, givin you pound
[Sheek]
What? Like I won't run up and break your jaw
like they make a vest for your head to stop the 4
I'm tired of rappin, let's get the mack and send niggas on vacation
right in front of the radio station
motherfuckers aint quiet til the tech go off
arteries hitted, hawkin, they neck is shit
I'm the motherfuckin hardest
I smack the shit out of any one of your artists
whatever the label
y'all niggas don't want beef, y'all want meat at the table
and I don't give a fuck, Sheek'll do life in the box
before any of y'all bitch niggas front on the LOX
What? Motherfuckers, c'mon
[Jadakiss]
Yo, If I miss your head and your neck, I'll hurt your chest
if you from the streets betrayal is worse than death
and I'm known for gettin money, not known for wildin
but I'm real I could rock both phones in the island
this is how we even the bets
I kill everything you love dog, right now, even the pets
everything got dubs on it, even the vets
50 close, then 50 wide, even the sets
cuz the bullets is like calisthenics when I'm squirtin
when they start hurtin, that means they workin
only way we comin is hard
industry is like jail nigga, double R's runnin the yard, uh

(Jadakiss) Hahah (Sheek)
WHOOO!!! D-Block, Darkchild
Uh huh, yeah
Uh - yeah
[Verse - Jadakiss]
Yo, I'm just too much, I flow too sick
I be on top of the snare, all over the kick
Since a youngcat, I been one wit the drum tap
The purple start pushin my lungs back
Been there, done that
My words stick to you like thumb tacks
Pardon me, LOX hooked up wit Rodney
The Ferrari's teal, but the truck's mahogany
Hating, I can't get you bastards off me
Fresh like I just took the plastic off me
Me and streets is high school sweethearts
And I'm always in her so she can't divorce me
Can't see farther than Kiss, I'm like a father to this
Want ya go and cop your father to this
I possess the whole package - the girls, the thongs
And there's something about me the world just loves
D-Block bringing hell of a pain, 'Honey' tell em my name
[Chorus - Jadakiss & (Woman)] (2x)
(J-A-D-A) I'm pulling it out, the guns'll pop
(J-A-D-A) I'm taking your money, the funeral stop
(J-A-D-A) The club'll band, the beat'll knock
(J-A-D-A) We just keep going, this shit don't stop
[Verse - Sheek Louch]
Sheek Louch get it popping, this shit don't stop
Got your boobs hitting, shaking in a Halter Top
Drizzling out, no shirt, burgandy drop
Chain's bigger than Chuck D and Flava's clock
Yeah boy, Sheek kinda hot these days
Hold the heat when I spit, need ten ice trays
D-Block what up? what's fucking wit that?
Got the Camp spitting heavy on this Jerkins track
Glock jerk him back, either that or the mac
I prefer chrome but take it if you got it in black
Thick shorty wanna hop on it
I tell her not here, but we could go inside the bathroom 'Honey
Let me give it to your straight, I ain't spending no money
We could drink till we pass out, make dicks and all that
I'm a gangster, I bet shorty crawl back
Got her job through a two way contact
[Chorus - Sheek Louch & (Woman)] (2x)
(S-H-E-E-K) Pulling it out, the guns'll pop
(S-H-E-E-K) I'm taking your money, the funeral stop
(S-H-E-E-K) The club'll band, the beat will knock
(S-H-E-E-K) We just keep going, this shit don't stop
[Verse - Sheek Louch]
Hey yo it's Louchy baby, smoke screen in the Mercedes
Naw it's just weed, I'm fucking wit y'all
Oil slick, it's the juice that I throw out the back
But it's for real lil nigga if you hearing the clack
I'm bringing it back, you don't wanna jump to this
I'm David Blaine, it's magic how I gave it the Kiss
Letting it off, nigga like we hunting to diss (J-A-D-A)
Hey yo Kiss (Jada: what up Louch?) yo take it from there
[Verse - Jadakiss]
Raspy voice, flow of the year; It's the cue tip bars
They feel good when they go in your ear
Ti Gun, Peanut Punch your girl ain't ready (F-A-G-E-A)
(Sheek: Sheek Louch!) Jadakiss, the world ain't ready
We got haze in the air and we pouring the yac
Bout to get up on 'Honey' cause she throwing it back
And you know I keep the hawk on my neck, so don't violate
Cause I can't wait for it to go in your back, uh
[Chorus - Jadakiss & Sheek] (Woman) (4x)
(J-A-D-A) I'm pulling it out, the guns'll pop
(S-H-E-E-K) I'm taking your money, the funeral stop
(J-A-D-A) The club'll band, the beat'll knock

Keep the gun cocked
Keep the gun cocked
Keep the gun cocked
The hood know what it is
Keep the gun cocked
Keep the gun cocked
Represent Double R
The hood know what it is
Keep the gun cocked
Keep the gun cocked
Boost the crime rate
The hood know what it is
I'm in the hood 'cause I fuck with the thugs
Tryin' to figure out why the money never added up to the love
[Verse 1]
I be around but I just be outta sight
And I'ma be spittin till the world run outta mics
In the hood till the projects run outta mice
Bettin' heavy 'till the bodegas run outta dice
And I'm workin with more hammers than you can imagine
And when I get in the booth I do it with passion niggaz
It's the same old kiss mango six
Seats suede listening to something Sheek just laid
And sometimes I feel I oughta chill
And I ain't scared but I guess it's only right
when you rein' with a quarter mill
Your ends go up your mens go down
It's like tryin to roll a dutch with the windows down
And I'm comin from the gulliest blocks
Winter time drug game slow my niggaz pump skullies and socks
But I ain't gonna challenge you to talk
I'ma see you when I see you with the bats, hi calibers and hawks- what
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Ayo you hatin' on Infa.Red get on line
I got more fans than the project building in the summer time
Shit on your idol smack your protégé
Kick your moms in the back crack her vertebrae
And fagots only respect pressure
If you ballin' why you staring at old Moet bottles on your dresser
And I'm not the one to brag
But I put more red dots on you than a target bag
I sew your body up in a mattress
Put you in the basement use you for target practice
I feel like Q when her pushed Bishop off the roof
These niggaz in the hood keep sayin I got the juice
I'm a hustler first a rapper second
Don't tell Hove or L.A. Reid that's off the record
I just tripled my advance
you Hummer stuntin like you got birds
you only getting points off grams-cock sucka
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna hear about your set or wherever you claim
Don't tell me 'bout oh boy, whatever his name
Don't you know in anybody hood barettas'll reign
New York don't think O-dog is jealous of Kane
I'm never mad at a nigga about the letter he bang
I tell niggaz to get they money up and better they aim
Controversial sales'll let me make a controversial statement
I will murder everybody in this game stop hatin'
If it's true that the rap game ain't far from coke
I could tell you how many bubbles in a bar of soap
I'm Double R biatch that's V.I.P
Ghetto parks on me, street niggaz might need to see ID
K in the truck on the low-low
Even got the house on hydrolics it's jumpin with doe doe
Keep a lil something somethin' kissin that waist
Cali go hard never mention that place
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
It's Flashy y'all yeah I spit the cockiest bars
So if there's beef nigga then see me I'm not a mirage
I rock with a R so if anything pops I'm involved
The six sawyers poppin' 'em all and the problem is solved
See Ruff Ryders's like a religion I follow the laws
Stick to code violating bodies'll fall
Its not an option to starve
That's why I stay in the booth like prison guards when they watchin' the yard
And yeah I heard they callin Flashy insane 'cause I ain't change
Got a new deal and I still catch a cab or a train
I'm still the same nigga packaging caine
Rolling up L after L like cool J was on the back of my name
So if its drama niggaz know where I live
But I guarantee you'll pay some repercussions for approaching the crib
'cause if the raps ain't soak in your wig then ice pokin' your ribs
'cause when its beef the hood know what it is- Nigga

[lil' man] I wish I didn't have to be here
[Jadakiss] It's not that bad..
Could always be worse, yaknahmsayin?
All you gotta do, is stay in school
Anything you wanna do you could do yaknahmsayin baby?
No matter what though, gotta keep your head up to the sky
[Jadakiss]
This goes out to, all the infants
in this cold world that was born addicted
And to all the section eight kids
Just remember these four words y'all - we gon' make it
The government keep on tryin to fool us
The system, keep on tryin to lose us
And all we can do is keep buyin computers
And (?) all now 'fore it start goin down
We gotta hold our head, keep our pride
Though it hurts when I see people sleep outside
Little babies with no socks on, eatin popcorn
We all know what they moms and they pops on
Out go the love when the drugs come
They never got nuttin for Christmas, and they ain't Muslim
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
This is a jewel, a lot of us was them
[Chorus: Ann Nesby]
Your head to the sky.. my my, my
You can win - you can win - if you keep your head
As long as you keep - your head - your head to the sky
My my, my..

Uhh, to my lockdown niggaz keep your head in the sky
To my shot down niggaz keep your head in the sky
I don't know if it's better to ride, or better to die
And that's why there's red in my eye
Cause people don't know what the ghetto is like
Either you make it out, or the terrible life
I don't wanna be a broke bastard
And everybody in the hood got somebody in they fam' with a coke habit
You work for minimum wage
I'ma get in the game, get shot or a bid in the cage
It's a risk I gotta take - and I'ma be the nigga
with the bricks and the stash and the biscuit outta state
And even though I'm blessed with the gift
I gotta move cause the pain and the sickness gotta wait
I go extremely hard - why let up?
And I can breathe long as I keep my head up
[Chorus w/ minor variations]
[Jadakiss]
Uhh, uhh - uh-huh, uhh - uh..
Aiyyo I come from a place where it's three strikes out
And your life's on the line, so we iced out
Summertime gettin money, three dice out
Tanktops, and jean shorts, we Niked out
Headbands, and four wheelers
Jeeps and Coupes and convos, about who know more killers
It's all wrong but it's all right
It's a small world; matter fact it's a small life
We all trip but the way to survive
is hold your head and make sure you fall right
And it's a quite fact, that whatever goes around comes right back
It's just like that
And we tryin to touch major paper
Everybody in the struggle it gets greater later
Never say can't, it's better to try
And you can breathe long as you keep your head in the sky

Don't you let nobody stop you, mm
Heyy, heyyy, yeahhh!

Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it,
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute,
You look a ***** in the eye, you could tell if he tinted,
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks,
They act like it's all love, only love is your money,
so when it's over *****, are you a thug or a dummy,
I'm neither, but I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever,
and I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya,
and f*** rap I make mills of reefer,
I'm a man first, tired of punchin *****z, so I'ma shoot *****z cuz my hands hurt,
and God is great, guard ya space,
one hand wash the other, both wash the face,
and I head crack so much, it's hard to ace,
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!
[Chorus - Styles P (Jadakiss)]
f*** that, pop off till nothin in the clip left (pop off)
till nobody in his clique left (nobody)
hole in the head, slashed or the split chest
if they asked what happened (tell em it's the Kiss Of Death)
Hustle hard till none of them bricks left (nothin left),
stick it up till not a crumb on the strip left (take that, take that)
Make sure aint a chain or a chip left (uh uh)
If they asked what happened (tell em' its the Kiss Of Death)
Tell em Kiss (THE KISS OF DEATH!)
[Verse 2 - Jadakiss]
This is LOXville, and even white America'll let y'all negros know Jada got skill
You a jackass like Johnny Knoxville,
so I can jus imagine how ya pops feel (damn!)
and you aint worth my shells, so you should just imagine how the Ak feel,
a lotta *****z is thousandnaires, walkin round town, frontin like they got millz
for what it's worth, I'm one myself, but my strength in the hood outruns my wealth
but you still might catch Kiss in some hot wheels, New Bently coupe, with the stock wheels,
Haha, look how I get back to it, I send my young *****z to do it, in the black Buick,
I don't spit bars, I distribute the crack fluid,
all I'm really waitin on is for *****z to act stupid
[Chorus]
[Verse 3 - Jadakiss]
To all my real *****z, sorry for keepin you waitin,
it's ironic, but the god was beefin with satan,
I love y'all tho, my *****z for even relatin,
this ain't Kiss talkin neither, I'm speakin for Jason,
when you a problem it's harder to keep them from hatin,
*****z jaws, is like laws, don't easy to break em,
if I wasn't on some s***, I'm gettin on it, come to me with ya hand out to me, I'm spittin on it,
I don't wanna hear what happened, matter of fact, I don't even care what happened,
Might as well declare the clappin, cuz my bones is old,
gotta lotta wear and tear from scrappin,
Hate a ***** that, ain't never there to see s***, but always hear what happened,
The thing better than money, is respect,
no love this time, *****, Kiss Of Death, what!

I'm takin it right there - they leave me no choice
AOWWWWW!! Uh, uh, oh
[Verse One]
She said she was a model for a year and a half
And if she took her pins out,
then her hair would drop down to her calf
I knew her man, he was just up North
and would've got left up North, but he was the chef up North
Anyway I'm K-I-double
All I do is get dough, spit flows, try to stay out of trouble
If you ready we could move, just lose your man
or hit the dance floor, I'll show you how to do my dance
Or I might let you play in the garden
Or sit up in that white thing and listen to the greatest of Marvin
The estate got six locations
Take so long to get to the front once I missed probation
And I hate to brag
I know ya man really wouldn't like the Beretta but he'd hate the Mag
And yeah here go a blank check, rock yourself out
But in the mean time girl - knock yourself out
[Chorus]
Oh you modelin momma? (knock yourself out)
Wanna let ya hair down? (knock yourself out)
Oh you ready to move? (knock yourself out)
Whatchu wanna sit in the Coupe? (knock yourself out)
Wanna keep on dancin? (knock yourself out)
Wanna run in my mansion? (knock yourself out)
Sit in V.I.P.? (knock yourself out)
Bitch you just wanna be seen (knock yourself out)
[Verse Two]
Now you can knock yourself out like you boxin yourself
Or you can get real freaky start poppin yourself
And my watch got so many rocks, when you look at the time
it's sorta like you watchin yourself, uhh
Front if you want, I puff a few blunts
and take a cruise in a Porsche wit the trunk in the front
She had the Jocko B'sure sandals, told her hop in
The coupe blew her mind when she couldn't find the door handles
Attitude very high maintence; check this out ma
I'm runnin out of my patience
Don't sleep wit me? Then don't speak wit me
And neva talk bad bout niggaz that eat wit me
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Aiyyo, honey know I'm waitin to leave
Keep dancin, cause I like how that ass shake in them capris
I'm like Big wit the murder mamis up in Belize
but I'll still fuck a chickenhead like Lil' Cease
I don't care if they model, bet they all gon' chill
First nigga to cook base on a Foreman grill
And you might win some, but you just lost one
Kiss +Miseducates+ 'em like Lauryn Hill
[Chorus - (Fades)]

And it's just too hard to hate Kiss
For now give me a water then send a guard or waitress
I'm a be in the rear burnin a fat one
Somethin to hold me down, until the yak come
Gotta a 5 sack on the couch they ready
Three piece over there but they kinda heavy
Great chicks waitin on the word
And I got the older ones hatin on the birds
I wanna know, am I am pimp or a zip outta luck
Bishop Don Juan betta get my cup
And they ain't pay me to get on the mic
But if it's goin down then I might just pop shit on the mic
And before I let go please let me get anotha glass of Exo
Ready let's go

Starin as I glide by
Four inches add a extra somethin to it, switch catchin all the side eyes
Saw somethin nice, but I never chase

Crazy we ain't leavin 'til the sunlight
Partyin is worth it baby, only if it's done right
Over for you limited funds dudes that ain't nice
Don't matter where you from shake ya asses

Yo, yo, I know niggas wit honor and will
That'll still crush the blow up and then pass they mama the bill
So I'ma always be able to burn my strip
cause my bags be stuffed and I burn my tips
And it ain't no tellin what the snub'll do
So when y'all go and cop vests cop one for your mother too
And I'm way better than them other dudes
But I'm stuck wit, what I'm stuck wit, cause I don't suck dick
Sat with the players and I stood with the coaches
And I'ma always be in the hood like roaches
Flow is ferocious, dough is ferocious
Two guns by each lung with no holsters
And I control all the fishscale in the city
And still make your first week sales look pretty
I come through, all you hear is chip in the muffler
And you could ask anybody if the Kiss is a hustler
CHORUS:
Styles: He's a hustler
Jadakiss: I hustle anywhere, any town, any borough, any strip, uh
S: He's a gambler
J: I always hold it down, gettin bankroll in 4, 5, 6 in trips
S: He's a gangster
J: I always make the paper and the FBI got me on they list, that's why
S: He's a Ruff Ryder nigga, Ryde or Die nigga
J: By the way, did I tell you that my name is Kiss?
[Verse 2]
And I don't understand how a broke nigga could chill
When a two liter'll dust you so get you a mil
Yes I got loose ends, poppin out the sunroof of the blue M
I'm like Lou Sims
And I'ma make sure they hit you wit both shotties
I think this summer's gon be the most bodies
You never ask a nigga in jail if he chillin
Just make sure you make all the sales in the building
Cuz now niggas think it's all right to tell
And you could put out some garbage and it might could sell
Alotta niggas be petty and sheist
But that's only til you treat 'em like a video and edit they life
This is a threat, when I talk you listen to death
And if I run out of money then my wrist is a bet
And the streets said they wanted more Kiss
Up north niggas pop me in, and do a hundred more dips
CHORUS
[Verse 3]
Yo, whether it's dope money or rap money, gamble the shit
Trey pounds of Mauseburgs, handle the shit
Got too big for the city, cops brought in the feds
So we moved across the map and brought in the bread
Niggas chill for a month and a half, no ruckus
Got the pictures of baggers and all of the gun busters
And you know how it go, cuz it rarely'll change
Everybody got a license and a alias name
We don't smoke when we hustle and none of us talk
Back to back til we home, we can front in New York
Cuz some of us is runnin from court
Smokin weed, mumblin thoughts
Tryin to stay humble for shorts
We could do this the mob way and kiss you on both cheeks
Or do it the hard way and shoot through your gold teeth
Stand on any block, play cee-lo and craps
And break niggas for they pack money, then give it back, uh

C'mon
I need a good girl
I need a good girl
I need a good girl
[Verse I]
Eyes all chinky
She be coming through in the new Cadillac Escalade on twinkies
Ma got a perfect face, brilliant ass
Her hands and her feet look like a mill in cash
I love when I call and she still in class
Instead of down in Bloomingdales stealing bags
And you know ya man Jada shoot through the hood
She look so good that the chickenheads can't hate her
Ever seen a dime? she a hell-a one
Still make her hop out and cop me a dutch, a vanilla one
Taught her how to murda the highway
Put her up on mean shoes like Roberto Cavale`
Even though she look real ill in the Gucci
Now you might catch her in Amilio Puchi
Since she a good girl that attend college
I don't let her give me brain I just let her give me knowledge
[Hook 2X: Carl Thomas]
She's a good, good, good, good girl
Such a real fine lady and a lucky girl
I don't want no nasty girl
I don't want no nasty girl
[Verse II]
I'ma show you the kiss of life sorta like Sade
G-class 5, the seats go sideways
Wit the see-through roof, OOF!
Rims so big they leave dents in the highway
My good girl ride wit me
She take over the wheel everytime I pull over to piss
She shake it up in the club when I'm over them hips
Waking up to the turkey bacon over the grits
Orange juice and the newspaper over the clips
Later on she gon hook up spaghetti
She ain't worried 'bout Herm S shit she got it already
She said she knew about the game cause her father was heavy
Then she asked could she borrow the Chevy
I could zoom in the jag
She going shopping need room for the bags
I sped off in the joint like it's Raspy's world
Cause (I don't want no nasty girl)
[Hook]
[Verse III]
She's a good girl, I love her for that
She got mad dough, I love her for that
Her moms is cool, I think her lil' brother a rat
Everything else is straight though other than that
She dont play no games, I love her for that
Or hang wit no dames, I love her for that
I told her roll for dolo, leave the chicks
Attitude, reflex leadership
And the sex is incredible, I love her for that
How she fit me in her schedule, I love her for that
And she like making love by the lake for hours
Or just chillin' on the block, on a crate for hours
This Jadakiss, and Timbaland
This is Raspy's world
And I don't want no nasty girl

Fuck this hit the Panama Canal and get a harder connect
Step on your toes, mess with your hoes, shoot up your mans
Come through the block tryin to screw up your plans
Cuz I still rob niggas for coke
Understand I'm the first one they call when they gettin the dope
I'm the one who prick your finger when they give you the oath
I'm the one who made the hit when they bring you the toast
Like Pacino and DeNiro 'cept they call me Paniro
Sad Styles still spin that arrow, fuck it
Like the boss of New York, you know how I feel
Kill a motherfucker cuz a corpse don't talk (no doubt)

Load the tech up and go shoppin my nigga

You know what the fuck I want, bricks of raw
and I'm too old to make less than a hundred a year
If it means wavin the hammer and leavin you there
If it means grabbin your kids out daycare
Somebody losin a seed, pay or bleed
It's Sheek Louch, I aint got no heart
I shoot broad daylight right in front of the mark
I put 28 holes through the icy car
Fuck around, like the God won't squeeze
If I don't see the badge I'm clappin the D's
LOX motherfucker, the OX motherfucker
The reason why you shouldn't cop drops motherfucker
Like it's something for me to shoot your pops motherfucker, what

Ayo the dopes and the rice, the cokes and the pyrex
over the stove and I'm bout to hit it with the ice
Runners love to pump the bomb
They know no fair ones, now niggas'll jump they moms
You god, minus the 12 disciples
I pop up, all you see is shells and rifles
If I don't like you, I'ma kill you not fight you
I bite a little piece of your ear off like Mike do
and everybody gon' follow me now
Down eighth and an oozie mahogany brown
Faggots want you to kill 'em in a hurry
It fucks me up, like they aint got no money to get buried
You could flip, I'll survive m'kay, motherfucker

Down in Miami done seen my bitch - now

She like to do it anywhere, a real hardhead bitch
And she enjoy riffin when I'm gone
but love when I say I'll be there in a minute, listen for the horn

She go to college, she model, and she got chips

to see my shorty in Magnolia, she got gold fronts
We don't kiss; matter fact I only hit that once
but she chill and she like to smoke big fat blunts
Then I'm swingin through Detroit to see my boo
You think you got every color mink? She got two
And she just slapped a hundred on the toy
Honey was a gangstress for real, gettin money off the board
Then I'm hittin Chi-Town, soon as it die down
Lay up in my chick's house, break a couple pies down
Nobody can do this but 'Kiss, freeze..
.. music please (ahhh-hahhh!)

My chick got the gold Benz and the gray Lex
I hit her with a shirt on cause she got fake breasts, c'mon

That I'm on my way to Philly to see my bitch (yesss)
She talkin shit on the celly like she that bitch (yesss)
And this how you know it's definitely real
When you drop the CL-6, then you knock Stephanie Mills
When I get there, she gon' show me more than some brotherly love
Top piece 'til I cum in her mug
I'm tryin to leave and she givin me hell
Told her bend over; I'ma crack that ass like the Liberty Bell

I oughta be there by breakfast if I leave by six
And ain't nuttin stoppin Ja'

Gun heavy pants saggin I'm used to cream
Who you know can make a million dollar bail on cash
Never did a day and got the jails on smash, K-I double
I move the perico quick, and just let manteca bubble
'Kiss been a boss, y'all just start workin
Now put ya hands up 'til ya arms start hurtin
Don't put 'em down 'til I tell you

Get a Black Phone, rent some of Jigga's stuff
I'm like T-Dub, you wanna be dubbed (no doubt)
I was there when a lil' nigga re'd up
You ain't Willie, you just act G'd up
[Jadakiss]
Yeah, uh, yo
I branched out, so you can get the deez
In the glass seam bags you can pull the stamps out
Nigga the champ's out, we don't rock loud colors
We pop loud guns nigga to stand out
You know what it is kid, your man got the money in his crib
Then we gon' go in your man's house
Double R D-Block nigga the camp's out
Can't forget about Swizz, he blowin the amps out, what?
[Swizz Beatz]
How y'all doin out there?
How y'all doin out there?
The hood's hot!

Headed OT? Then bring some pies with ya
(Buy your man a lambo and tell him to fly with ya)
Or throw the nigga jewels and tell him to shine with ya

That's what we responsible for
(Battin you down)
Knifin you up

Bail a nigga out for stealin something out on the tour
(And they makin technology to trya nd screw niggas)
I'm good long as an old gun will kill a new nigga
(Yall dudes with 9 lives got one life left)
And controversy sells but it aint like death
(So pop him in the head til his brains start to fizz on him)
I aint sell my soul to the devil, I bought his from him
(Waitin on the day they say jesus is gonna come)
So god bless yall niggas cuz im sneezing with my gun

Iced out
(Or wear no ice at all)

Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, hour
Beats is knockin, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody aint put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin wit beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgandy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome

Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and icesticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggaz killin over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holdin dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus america cause that every car thats drivin
Holdin the homeless sign you focus you know its Nas then
Prince of the globe, leave no prince of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankencense wit a ghost

And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people

If ya niggas is snitch, been judgin my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Call this girl after dark so we talked the bitch
We aint care cause the whore wasnt shit
Doll, I aint takin the L or waistin a shell
I bring the heat like I'm satan itself
Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers

It's only a phone call, the tend to take that and run with it
So every other month I be on some new number shit
They violated Stay again, Gus totaled the beamer & broke Kay leg again
shhh, let us pray again and I ain't get enough of hanging in local bars yet
Had to let the thang off, cross town in the projects
All these rumors, shit I ain't get robbed yet
Bitch ass niggaz ain't stop actin like broads yet
And arm reach off a gun & a mask, somebody clipped me for a hundred in cash
Still feel me, I hit the road try to get more grip
It was cool til' a mutha fuckin tour bus flipped
uh, no charges brought up, bitch popped up with a kid
Got caught up, then I put a court up
Now The road the the riches is taking me longer
It ain't kill yet so it makin me stronger

I do my thang in the hood, get right with a budget
Ain't afraid to give my life to the public
And when you see me next time maybe we can further discuss

Y'all know to him is bustin', so just dap me up and frown on
Me and Kiss is necessary, that much you can count on, yeah

Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready

How did him and Bubba rise from this dirt and this cow feces?
To show you folks the hope for this changin' shall be me
Notice how he see, the picture for it's painting
and poured you up of this mixture before it was tainted
See I was rydin' ruff only when me and D became aquatinted
and I pledge to maintain it, be damned if I'ma change it
This shit is anus, ain't it? Fuck 'em, Kiss bring it home
I ryde or die with Beat Club, won't bend for the sake of this song
[Jadakiss]
The streets is still mine, I stay with the still nine
and it's still long and if I'm stronger than corn like I pinkeyed
Niggaz pretend to be weeded, that's what the industry needed
Kiss flippin' his flow, enemies heated
But we gon' let the gats pop
From the old rifles on the dirt road to the handguns on the blacktop
Don't get the plot wrong, this ain't a black or white politic thing
Cocksucker, it's a hot song
[Timbaland]
Jada talk so good, but they brain is not ready
They don't know know
Bubba talk so good, but they brain is not ready
They don't know know know

[Jadakiss]
Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And...it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail cause them years'll cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggaz, or over trust them
Uh...yeah them M's is right in my face
I just gotta throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the Tech will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, that time is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground
[Jadakiss]
I know how to get my pairs off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbin your head
Know that he's sick, know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwin them bricks
Puttin purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwin them nicks
That's right, homey, you can't move me
I ain't goin nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shootin is the breeze, a bootleg uzi
I'm just waitin on a que like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just gotta feel the kid
if not rap for the fact of how real he is, whatever
[Chorus]
[Jadakiss]
Aiyo, niggaz know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just wanna rock for a century
Then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothin other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from +Blow+, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck ridin the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out lookin crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you.
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Ya'll ain't fuckin with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get outta line
Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

And thats why my girl is with me
I love it when she layin in the bed with a pearl long vickie
The next best thing to a soldier
Go hard with a fat ass and a head full of rollers
Just look in her eyes and tell she's real

And it been that way, fuck how a nigga live it's gon' end that way
Niggas is part of a game that I don't play
Never catch dog carrying what I don't weigh
That's three 45s, one 38, 173 pounds straight out the gate
I don't hate, got no beef but knock a nigga off quick
And I'm mad like a bitch and a nigga with a soft dick
Get off this, fucking with X, but on some other shit

What you wanna bet the llama'll squash you
I been had a white fan base before the signing of Marshall
Boy Kiss is thorough, hit your girl
Put it all up her stomach til she earl

And it ain't only the voice it's the bars of death

When is they getting off our dicks, them niggas is clowns
How many dogs you let go up, still getting down

For stomach and I feed still trying to eat

Yall niggas gonna know when we hungry, you get stuck up
(What what?)
What's up? Fuck a nigga yelling
Y-O motherfucker for real, yo Kiss tell 'em
[Jadakiss]
Sheet could kill, stomp niggas out boot the grill
I'll give you a reason why I'm the truth for real
Niggas can't fuck with Kiss, I mean that
Had to stop eating red meat cause I ate too many Beanie-Macs
I'm not one of them niggas and since you so richeous
Don't make me send your ass to Ala quicker
Niggas gas you to force your hand
Realistically you just a worker and your boss is my man

They gotta use the scales that they weigh the whales wit

Carsons on the jeep, but Gotti made the prototype
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo light
[JK]
Determined niggas make it
Kickin down the door and we burnin niggas naked
[SP]
The house costs a million, sittin on the beach
and the only thing I know if it's furnished I'ma take it
[JK]
My bathtub lift up, my walls do a 360
We got the shit that the government got
Talkin money then you rubbin the spot
[SP]
Real niggas say that they be wildin
We on the Caiman islands
On a yacht wit our favorite albums
[JK]
a bad hoe and a plate of salmon
Smokin and drinkin nigga is you thinkin that our fate is violent
[SP]
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
and nobody on the faculty squeal, what

ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teachin kids how to read and write and use the ruger

Gun works official but niggas don't be wantin that
[Why?] Cuz they puss and they mans is lame

We so for real in the hood we make candy rain

You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death, and cry at birth
Never say you can't do it til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
but it's a message in everything trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the eight and the pound
Think you got your ear to the street now, put your face in the ground
Cuz my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin in intensive
my fellas is offensive
Lucky cuz I got guns that crack your back
but that's not what I prefer I manufacture crack
and, niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
but we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eatin right, gettin good rest either on the far or the foam
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
Sound anything like Kiss then sign right here
and, y'all just talkin, I'm doin it well

Welcome to D Block, the city of broke down dreams
With things aint always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers,
Pin handlers Hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun dont shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Cuz every cities got a ghetto and every ghetto got a hood
Take a good look around you cuz there's a D Block near you
[Jadakiss]
Place where aint no body that proud, its a fuckin black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Workin around though, see if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
Wild men is flappin the whole town though
Lot is assumin a *****s salary
More lies than truth definatly more rumors than reality
Only way you beatin a body is a technicality
Other than that catch em and clinton on a gallery
The determination and dedication of disipline
Listenin and catchin the ***els you was missin
And they still doin coward shit
You know the haters gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Somethin in the air but the older they get,
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick,
We dont play with the lizards, we make phrases up and say I'm exquisite,
Anytime you can pay us a visit

Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op-
-Portunity, as soon as you leave out that ***elry shop
And you wont even notice your mind will be so preo-
-Ccupied on that new watch you just copped
You wont even see that ride pull up along side you
You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks
D Block the place where gees get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You dont even see cops, hiphop police dont even stop,
On D Block, where everybody wants to be Pac
And you can get popped over the new G Unit reboks

Why they let the terminator win the election
Come on, pay attention
Why sell in the stores what you can sell in the streets
Why I say the hottest shit but we sellin' the least
[Chorus]
[Jadakiss]
Uh, yea, yo
Why Halle have to let a white man pop her to get a Oscar
Why Denzel have to be crooked before he took it
Why they didn't make the CL6 wit a clutch
And if you don't smoke why the hell you reachin' for my dutch
Why rap, cause I need air time
Why be on the curb wit a ""why lie I need a beer"" sign
Why all the young niggaz is dyin'
Cause they moms at work, they pops is gone, they livin' wit iron
Why they ain't give us a cure for aids
Why my diesel have fiends in the spot on the floor for days
Why you screamin' like it's slug, it's only the hawk
Why my buzz in L.A. ain't like it is in New York
Why you forcin' you to be hard
Why ain't you a thug by choice
Why the whole world love my voice
Why try to tell 'em that it's the flow son
And you know why they made the new twenties
Cause I got all my old ones
That's why
[Chorus]

Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve
Trapped in a belly of hell
Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him
They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it
They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]
Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught
When you scream at it and do it
With sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid
Don't understand the point that you at
Or how the hell you came to it?
Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
And when they told him the charge it kind of baffled him
Murder in the first for the champ, we on that again?

Could you hold it together?

You built for that weather?
Yo, know what'm saying?
Know what'm saying?
[Common]
You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'
Summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from
Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write
Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions
This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you
This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace Ru

You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me,
Retreat or run from me, crawl up or under me,
You can't do much for me besides serve
Me well and have good dividends returned to you
Or attempt to kill me off and have me murder you
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me,
Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully
Plaintively, I wait to see what history will shape to be,
Who's hearts will never die inside the sake of me

Keep a full account of all the names for me
And make a special mark for Hurricane who (?) patiently

[Verse 4]
The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising
From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us
They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul
Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the blind
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

You built for that? Is you cut for that?
Don't be telling me that you know the pain

In the Spirit of God.
In the Spirit of the Ancestors.
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers.
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur.
We make this movement towards freedom
for all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle.
Yeah.  yo, check it-
There were lights and sirens, gunshots firin
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on
to life.  She thought she'd live with no arm
that's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was buildin as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this german nurse they woulda served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all.
(Cee-lo vocals)
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yes.
Your Power and Pride is beautiful.
May God bless your Soul.
(Common)
It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies cracklin, I see 'em when they takin her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
a cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years inna hole.  Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered frredom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people-
(Cee-Lo)
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Oooh.
(Common)
Yo
From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
news that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
but she's free with political asylum in Cuba.
(Cee-Lo vocals)
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.
We're molded from the same mud, Assata.
We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Oooh.
(Assata)
Freedom!  You askin me about freedom.  Askin me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you.  I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
than about what it is, cause I've never been free.
I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is.
Uhh, the way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
blossom.
Freedom is -is the right to be yourself, to be who you are,
to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do.  (fade out)

Yeah, yeah
Me and my man Com Sense
Rallyin troops like Joseph Stalin
Where you at yo?
Common:
I'm bout to make the name Com Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Canibus:
And I'ma make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Canibus and Common:
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(Rakim from ""My Melody""(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)
Common:
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who yo team or who you startin with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggaz like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcisim, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got not get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
Canibus:
I'm creatin the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Puttin together them whether my rhyme one threat at a time
So you niggaz need to stop testin me
Cuz you know you can't ""F"" with me
Steppin to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposin yourself to the verbal radiations
Sayin you can defeat me is nothin but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggaz be diggin my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggaz couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What!
(scratching)
Common, steppin to me is like going to the county being a neutron
Common, I ain't scared of no nigga
Common:
I persue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggaz I'm dunkin like when cops mingle
Fuck hip hop jingles, rhymin big words and not sayin shit
The click that you came in with accent your flavor wit
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggaz off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper who's career
You could only take a glance, couldn't make the transition
>From B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference, the humbleness
But in the Chi, bumbleless
Was thinkin as a weakness were poetrys in motion
Like a bitch, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
(scratching)Fuck with Canibus(x4)
Canibus:
Yo, the Canibus is an animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin to damage you, spittin understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead sharp peripheral
With 360 degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get biten with venom
>From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the shroud of turan, for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshippers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist, trash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, takin pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me
Because they saw me, up in The Source chillin on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
www dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talkin to chicks
That was sweatin me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talkin mad trash tryin to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it bag to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave.
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, comin to see you
Common:
It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Canibus:
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Common and Canibus:
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)
Common:
Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear

Dear Liza, Minelli, I jam like jelly and I got

I can remember times when for a 40 I had to beg for bucks
Nobody really gave a, so I had to beg for fucks
Now what do niggaz do when they got not food
Skibbidy skap and busta bust a rap
So I pick up the pen and then begin the thoughts to get to pumpin
Hopin like all the people let me talk, let me say somethin
Cause nothin for nothin leaves nothin, I got nuthin to lose
I put, nuttin in my notes, I'm not your host when I got nuttin to use
Dues gettin credited, now I debit my bank account
Not on a blind date, could I see me taken out

I'm spas-ta-gis-a-mister-gis a mister-gis-ta-spas-ta-gis
Spectacular, the papes I Count like Dracula
You can't cut the rug, because you suck, MC Vacumn Up

Their ain't no way or half-step, and flex a rhyme like a bicep
Some steps with concepts, but umm, WHO cares
Not even the damn People Under the Stairs

Even if your name ain't Ripley, cause Ripley don't know diddley
Hit me one time, two times, for the U-AYYY-C

I hit a skid, and I peel out like MC Eiht, damn I kill it
Earn my money the old fashioned way - I steal it
Stop thief in the temple, I hit em with a blow
Somebody done stole my beeper but I'ma steal the show
I'm throwin a Heidi Hoe into a bro and tellin her
go for what you know bruh, the people before me go under
Yo we gotta gotta get we gotta get we gotta get
Gotta get, gotta gotta gotta get get over
Somewhere over the rainbow, I'm still the same old same old
Ringin around the collar, borrowin a dollar, check my balls
Dirty drawers, see the kitty suckin titties
Video watchin lush from the city
I'm the extra-terrestrial rappers go home cause they have to
Them marks be callin Ork, come in Ork, Nanu Nanu

A lot of shit has happened, since I started rappin
There's been enough beef, and enough gat clappin
[Royce da 5'9]
Yeah
I'da became a target
From the bottom became the hardest artist in the game
The first time they started to market my name
I started to change
Smart but hardly could think logically
The insane part of me layin inside of me says pardon
me so I part with the same side of me
I hang out with the same guys
Either they not noticin the game changin me or they ain't watchin me
Bitches sayin, ""hi"" to me
Niggaz who ain't hot as me
Picturin me slain niggaz gettin plain tired o' me
Lookin down at 'em when he got the same drive as me
We the same niggaz aim just as high as me
Everything is the same with us but the thing is that I
came in here with a different anxiety
Hopefully the day I retire is approachin me lookin
back like those were the days I was fly
(But y'all gon' learn) from the mistakes to wait and
to be patient wrong turns did take up a lot of time
But I finally found my way around now I'm wiser
I thank God that I made it out alive

One man rises another falls
To discover all is one and one is all
I come to call like Jericho with the trumpets
It's wild and the honeys gramps and the Kwa hummin
The Lord soon comin
From glow some grow
Many stay stunted songs with the shorties knowin
I learn from the keep the dumb shit from my circumference
I run with niggaz that wanted and done it the hunted and blunted
L said it gotta come from the stomach
To me the stomach is the voice of the Lord
The revolutionary people's choice the award
Seein souls move forward
Ghosts move toward new homes and new floors for us to rise to
In the attic tapin up my Bible thinkin I cannot apply to survival
The un-American Idol seein by the size of those times
I put it in my rhymes
A lot of shit has happened
[Chorus]
[Chino XL]
Yo, welcome lambs to the slaughter
It's the most important moment in my life since the birth of my daughters
Regardless, all is well in the universe put man
track, and Chino who cannot spit a wack verse
My first CDs basically made me Marky Mark with the
whole planet of the apes chasin me
Here to save you all now rap ain't worth savin but I
can't get the pavement with gay shit like Craig David
Vocal arrangements even basic I'm still the hottest
nigga to spit inside of my cousin Tigga basement
I've no replacement for what's seeming like ages
I ain't no hypochondriac complainin I stay sick
Standin ovations for acapellas shitiations
I get better with agens everybody's observation
Starvation to brawl the last samurai
Take an eye for an eye till the world goes blind I'm bovine
Raging bull words are my weapons hoping not over ya head like cangos in '87
I move from Jers' to Cali' fillin the love
Move moms to Miami promised I would
Beef 'n drama i've been you wouldn't last through
What's funny motherfucker I wanna laugh too
But now I'm ready to get rich old dog new tricks
Told L could dig to China with chopsticks
When I switch to the big leagues this year with no fear
Cuz who'd even believe that I'd be here

I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryin to make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Lock'd in this Grid like a Tupac tale
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this Illa-thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin thoughts
to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, with Hieroglyphics spelled in chalk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle
I think I, need a cup of a tea, because I'm novel
(come on bay-bayyy) Bust it

A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
The brain-wash, with my vocal tones I rinses
Opportunity and the beat knocks
Women, give me rhythm like beatbox, but it's the year
of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
who's flavored from stacks, to Reeboks
Send blessings to the family of Ice Mike
Shit like that, don't help me write right, but I got site/sight
like a destruction worker, when it's time to build
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's +Time to Kill+
In perseverence I'ma find a meal, and provoke
My Gramps used to trick off big papers at the Riverboat

Check it
I walk downtown to tempos and never lose the beat
Some people got ignorance confused with bein street
on the, street of desire my body and soul meet
Arguin over thick broads and meals with no meat
Had the cold feet for a second
Mega-niggaz in my box throwin suggestions
Had me checkin myself and double checkin, I popped the +Resurrection+
In the mirror I only heard my reflection
Let me hold mics, while you hold dicks and CD collections
And at MusicLand and Coop's, we can make connections
I meditate with confidence, to not chomp on cents
Outspoken like 30's but yet I guard my lips
Writin niggaz with stripes, I hold posture with
Poppin shit to fat broads, wearin os-trich
Givin em voicemail, tracks are like County
To them I voice-jail/gel, if you believe in Heaven
why is the choice Hell? Why is this choice Hell?
Why is this choice Hell?

Iahhhhh jus' wanna rock you
Alllllll night looooong, oahhhhohhh (keep goin)

One day, I was tryin to be myself
The same day this thug say,  You gotta come hard
Nigga, times is hard, I'm tryin hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell, it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, its hard to stop drinkin
I guess it's hard for hard niggaz to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction that related to me
I hated to be, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggaz, be too hard to say  ho  at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she saying,  Have a real job
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal
Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, but my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? You should be gettin rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin niggaz but readin be makin me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggaz stuck on one and them-a ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie

Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down

I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill

No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time

Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see em
My ancestors, when I'm writin I see em, and talk wit em
Hopin in the promise land I can walk wit em
Shitted on, so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall wit em
Molest concepts, start rhythm, paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MC's reckless ?I ball? why y'all wanna go and do that?
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes

Intro: Common
Yeah  one two  bless
Yeah yeah  check it
I got my mellow Sean Lett
He gonna get down for y'all Chicago style
Eighty seven  you know the bidness  check it
Chorus: Common  Sean Lett
After eight years of my life  of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning  so lately I've been thinking
After eight years of my life  of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking
Verse One: Common
Nearest to the go gothic, a cash flow prophet
Methods of gettin scratch and talkin slick I've adopted
Palms in the lock with stunts whose hearts be game
Hoes in the stable, none do I claim
Niggaz with nothin to shoot for, at they only aim
Gramps in the choir singin it's gonna rain
in the midst of precipitation, I make the power
manipulations, so my offspring'll be straight for generations
Got connections in the nation
To incarceration, to general population
More lyrics than Jason, look me in the face when you speak to me
You got a tattoo? Bitch youse a freak to me
Seeking the, good sess material
Asking when's my next video
Bitch get a job and get your ass in somebody's university
Enroll your youngun in a nursery
And cleam him up, comb his hair, cover yourself
You want a man to love you you ain't loving yourself
I'm discovering wealth watches wisdom in ways
To make it in the last days, now bring it on
Chorus
Verse Two: Sean Lett
I feel blessed I survived two decades in this world
Then Ninety slid in naked now I got a baby girl
Ain't this a bitch, myself still a child
I want to hang on eighty-seven corners act wild on Stoney Isle
Better school her, so presence is your seed in society
Parks of envy jealous niggaz crack fiends yes indeed
I won't misleed and you can best believe
I'm just a blink away shorty anytime that you need
See I know right now, you're just too young to understand
Asking questions, why pops and moms don't be holding hands
Don't you worry about it yet, in due time we'll explain
Why having you, created just an everlasting shame
Bringing joy witcha smiles, tripping when you first walked
Knowing somebody's child is gettin outlined in chalk
Just relieved it ain't you, I got much love for you boo
Cause it ain't nuthin that these skanless niggaz in these streets
won't do
Stop me if I'm lying, see my race is steady dying
Short methods to making cream, bullets sprays and shatters dreams
See basically, Chi-town's game-related and designed
Niggaz store up theirs and down opposite signs
Chorus
Outro: Sean Lett, Common
It's like that y'all (yeah yeah)
Common Sense and dirty mizer on the set y'all
Sean Lett
We gonna get down like that
My man Eddie C on the board
We coming through y'all for eighty-seventh street
Seventy-first and everybody in South show
We coming through for niggaz on the West side
Down in the ickies, all up and down state
We gonna keep it straight like that
We straight out for gold
You call it Chi-town it's still our town
Holding it down like this with that eighty-seven sound
We talking about rocking niggaz state to state nationwide
On the real it's like that
Straight up South side is where we loaf
Shit be real around these parts, I'm serious
YouknowhatI'msayin? Hear me
You know what? We out though

My Dream Is To Be
My Dream Is To Be Free
[Verse 1:]
In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness,
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives,
Gunshots comin' from sounds of Blackness,
Given this game with no time to practice,
Born on the Black list, told I'm below average,
A life with no cabbage,
That's no money if you from where I'm from,
Funny, I just want some of your sun,
Dark clouds seem to follow me,
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me,
No apology, I walk with a boulder on my shoulder,
It's a Cold War - I'm a colder soldier,
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King,
I ain't usin' it for the right thing,
In between Lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes,
I put together pieces of a Dream
I still have one
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
The world's seen me lookin' in the mirror,
Images of me, gettin' much clearer,
Dear Self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul,
If I don't express it then forever I'll hold, inside
I'm from a side where we out of control,
Rap music in the 'hood played a fatherly role,
My story's like yours, yo it gotta be told,
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role,
Read scrolls and stow slaves,
And Jewish people in cold cage,
Hate has no color or age, flip the page,
Now my rage became freedom,
Writin' dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em,
I believe in Heaven more than Hell,
Blessings more than jail,
In the ghetto let love prevail,
With a story to tell, my eyes see the glory and well,
The world waitin' for me to yell ""I Have a Dream""
[Chorus]

In the Spirit of God.
In the Spirit of the Ancestors.
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers.
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur.
We make this movement towards freedom
for all those who have been oppressed, and all those in the struggle.
Yeah.  yo, check it-
There were lights and sirens, gunshots firin
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream, she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest, cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest, pain consumed each breath
Shot twice wit her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life, the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond, tryna hold on
to life.  She thought she'd live with no arm
that's what it felt like, got to the hospital, eyes held tight
They moved her room to room-she could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed, through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head, every word she got hit
""Who shot the trooper?"" they asked her
Put mace in her eyes, threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes, realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills, they told her: that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger-survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was buildin as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this german nurse they woulda served her worse
I read this sister's story, knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All this shit so we could be free, so dig it, y'all.

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies cracklin, I see 'em when they takin her
Though she kinda knew,
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about six inna morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
a cell, one cot, no window, facing hell.
Put in the basement of a prison wit all males
And the smell of misery, seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise, (paint?,) and begin to read
Two years inna hole.  Her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered frredom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed
Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free.
Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that woulda been me?
All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people-

From North Carolina her grandmother would bring
news that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done
Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
but she's free with political asylum in Cuba.
(Cee-Lo vocals)
I'm thinkin' of Assata, yeah.
Listen to my Love, Assata, yeah.
We're molded from the same mud, Assata.
We share the same Blood, Assata, yeah.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Your Power and Pride, so Beautiful...
May God bless your Soul.
Oooh.
(Assata)
Freedom!  You askin me about freedom.  Askin me about freedom?
I'll be honest with you.  I know a whole more about what freedom isn't
than about what it is, cause I've never been free.
I can only share my vision with you of the future, about what freedom is.
Uhh, the way I see it, freedom is-- is the right to grow, is the right to
blossom.
Freedom is -is the right to be yourself, to be who you are,
to be who you wanna be, to do what you wanna do.  (fade out)

Tryin to make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Lock'd in this Grid like a Tupac tale
While her-on rock smells make the cops tail
My third eye is my rail, on this L of thought
With afrocentric stamps I'm mailin thoughts
to my Gods held in court
I dwell where rebellion's taught, and emotions seldom walk
I try to Walk Like an Egyptian, but Hieroglyphics fail to talk
I guess the hustlin is the unspoken Gospel
Love that I'm an apostle, feel the holy spirit of Chicago
E Bottom, here's the bottle

Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
My guise pack heat enough to bury June, on my feet
Im getting married soon, walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Fumes of a real nigga seep into your room
Or through fifthteens of the your jeep that you boom
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Osun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building im the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors, tell them the game aint only the score
Hold on to your life as I carry these styles
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
You aint supposed to rhyme, better off with a clothing line
In this business of pimps, many hoes get signed
Opposed to shine so me holding the blinds
Mixing golden seal and wine, holding a nine

Between churches and liquor stores, my mic leaks
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
As you build and destroy yo remain yourself
They say im slept on, now im bucking in dreams
And rhyme with the mind of a hustler scheme
Or the struggle of feinds, I flow over water thats as troubled as teens
For the love of the team, trying to double the dream
Be greatful like the chruch psalm my grandmother sings
Im rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
Thinking rap is the only way out
The black human genius will never play out
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth, sent to replish the Eatrh
That truck that you roll is like a miniature hearse
I deaded your shit before you finished a verse
From niggas to gods from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
Realness is an act that you cannot rehearse
Holla back, but listen first

[First Verse]
She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We layed under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill, from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned,
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Her soul was tired and never really rested
Only with men through aggression
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom
Between me and you [echo]
[Chorus - Cee-Lo]
Sometimes I wish a, careless whisper
Serenade her, without speaking a word
Because of you I'm stronger, I'm afraid no longer
I feel so alive in me, you have liberated me
[Second Verse]
She laid, I watched her breathe
Happy to be here, not afraid to leave
I couldn't concieve her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Memories of that year, so close and vivid
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
The life of one so given early would God take it?
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
I stare with my eyes closed
Wonder when the body leave does the mind go
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors theres no cure
We went through doubt, and cases of insure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
Knew a part of her I could heal with words
But the (?) was (?)
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death
Between me and you [echo]
[Chorus]
[Third Verse]
He spoke with his eyes, tear-filled
A lump in his throat, his fear built
My whole life it was in steel
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
This is how real life's supposed to be?
For it to happen to someone close to me?
So far we'd come, for him to tell me
As he did, insecurity held me
I felt like he failed me
To the spirit, yelled help me
I'd known him for like what seemed forever
About going pro we dreamed together
Never knew it would turn out like this
For so long he tried to fight this
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself
Between me and you [echo]
[Chorus]
Liberation...
Peace

I don't get rid of some faces
while marks be lookin hard, and they be beggin bases
They have too many cases, and now they got courage
Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin to take Pop's porridge
But I got, the story straight
Plus the name, I got rep, don't dare sleep
Slept and got, crept
An AC/DC spider went up the wall we mount
Now came down the Common the Common Sense, and now the spider out
(BOOM) A blackout, power failure
I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows
uppercuts jabs hits and hey niggaz
Cause I'm weird they call me Lemonhead, but I'm a Jawbreaker
and I break a Bean, but I'm not from Boston
I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin
Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast!
I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS

Nor am I pretendin to be a two-shoes goodie

Ooh you in trouble!

You end up on a stretched cause I stretch you like Plastikman
Fuck with me (""you end up the in the cas-ket"")
You flow ass pussy nigga, sucker duck bastard

This Grape tried to step to me, with his arms down

So I take time
Out my day
To pray and I say
Now I lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep
My soul
Peep, I'm gettin' old
And it's a cold cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma
It's the same routine
Keep my room clean
I'm lookin' to do some new things but ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two - catch
In the prime of my life
I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel
Disgruntled, tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness
Aiight you sing, I may not be the darkest
Brotha
But I was always told to act my age and not my color
Knowin' that my color was that of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes get up stand up...etc.
It's like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain
When it rains it pours, and it's about to come down hard
Thank God I found you
As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance
From all angles
I tangle
For cash
Hopin' it'll last
'Til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
So I return to the arab
And on the way back
I stop and the liquor store
Grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop
And I can't turn around
Brew - I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up
My liver I burn it up (Fat line)
It's my life I live it up
The cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one way street and I done passed fun day
Three blocks ago
It itself life is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin - how come
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin
But I'm a couch bum what makes it bad I had incentive
But I disintegrated
To a state that's stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated
or blowed
Ain't dealin' with a full deck and any day I could fold
What makes it bad, I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from goin' under, I ponder
And try to keep my concentration
In this idiotic nation
They say become I doctor, but I don't have the patients/patience
Adjacent
To that situation
I want an occupation
That I'm into
'Cause yet if I begin to
Live to my potential
I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience
I reminisce and wish
I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just sunshine
But now it's like I'm gettin' older to so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happpy until I rest
In peace
Of mind
And find
Who I am
But thank God I found you

Hopin you won't drop you thought you had it made like ?Kay?
What more could go wrong - you got the right one baby!
Uh-huh, let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows
that you came quick, quicker than a pizza, from Domino's
To the break y'all (break y'all, YEAH)
To the break y'all (break y'all, MAYBE)
To the break y'all (break y'all, NAHHH)
To the break y'all (break y'all, check it out)
The 1/9, the 1/9, the CB's, the break
The 1/9, the 1/9, the CB's, the break!
The 1/9, the 1/9, the CB's, the break!!
Break it up, break it up, break it up, BREAK DOWN!
Walkin up and then down the strip
Lookin for some hip so I can skip
I spotted this honeydip, and her friend tried to sell me a script
that they were in a rush to catch the bus, but that was the OLD Gus
So I'm gettin a bus, as I thrill at the disgust
Since old girl was with this, I told her friend to kiss this
And listen physical fitness use your brain and mind your business
Dippin from a distance, in an instance I got the digits
and blew a kiss to her
(THAT OLD STANK HOEEEE) was mad I didn't speak to her
I hooked up with the one that looked NICE
Took her mind, like an ICE
'Til her friends gave her advice to think, twice
Before with me she slept, my rep was kinda ill
They told her to keep that booty still
I been through more hoes than the pill
Still I overcame cause I got game like a athlete (UHH)
In less than a half week, she was with it to do the nasty (BREAK)
The drawers dropped, the top off, and the boots was gettin knocked
I heard the door unlock, it was her pop he was a cop
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
Broke like a fingernail, on my trail was the smell of tail
Bailed back around the flat, to wash off the smell of cat
Like a belt, everything was strapped
'til my homey asked,  WASSUP WIT DAT?
The dat was like dis G, I told him I got busy
This was the spy who dissed me cause he told it like a sissy
THAT WAS FOUL, I went to him lost in the mind now it's a dead end
The little wreck on that they locked the door and I can't get in
No more no more no more and now I know and now I know
Don't mess around with CB's, good buddie, ten-fo'
(Ha hahh, yeahh, ahh break it..)

[Common]
I'm not tall, but can I bust?
Like the double dutch, going down the street
I rap to myself when there ain't no one to rap to
And to me, yo, my shit be sounding sweet
It's like doo rock, doo rock, oop
I chew with my group, chicken and we couped in a hoop
Deee! Somebody's breath is smelling poo
Geee! Tone, is that you? (I don't think so)
I'm one time, two times, three times a lady
Bay-beh, bay-beh, bay-bee
Ha! I make it happen, ladi de, ladi da
When I was a boy I said ""Oh"" but now I'm a man saying ""Ah""
Cha cha cha, who knows where the mouth goes
Yeah nigga, I'm fly, so keep your fucking mouth closed
Ralph goes ""Rasheed"" and I be saying ""Boo!""
Bitches welcome back Common with the ""Oooh oooh ooh""
And this is how I wreck it, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
This is how I wreck it, do doo doo do doo
Now one two check ir, I'm as Def as a Leopard
It could be, it should be, it is? Holy cow!
I'm grass hopping like the ?common Billy section?
Not the Godfather, but I lounge like a stepper
Grandma, breaks it, 8, we wait
(Ch ch chaa) I got scratch like a DJ
I used to want to be like, I used to want to be like
Mike, but the man in the mirror don't know if he's black or white
And that makes me mad
(Backwards scratching) Who's bad?
[Ynot]
Now can I bust in this era, I'm a plus like addition
And listen, I'm dishing out shit like a chef
The love is the Late Show, showing you the ladies
You late on the show? Oh we the greatest show? You right
To might right, raise, to my left, boom bap
In the back, Blazay Blah, so get the fuck out my face
Oh what a disgrace, you can't disgrace
Boys I'll erase you boys to mincemeat
Human means T, O's, N's, why's this is just a tease before my album
No bum is out, I'm out to parlay you Fritos
One chip off the block, so bust it down, bust the sound
Exciting as a big zap
I frighten those biting when Lord jabber tighten when tighten taken to loose
Ynot's no loser but I lost your real mind
I find you, finder's keeper's so you mind too
Your mind can't match mine when I do mine
Call mine, my mouth is a fucking gold mine
More chaws like monster jaws, I get ate like the balls
I got to rhyme, too, I climb you like a stepson
No weapon, but I got a rep, son, for taking fakes to the towel
Snakes in my file
Shit, I'll sit down all stand-up comic rappers
Who diss that who go on about fashion
Fasten your seatbelts til he melts to ice
T.O.N.Y.'s backwards, nevertheless
I attack nerds, fuck what you heard
Hey, gone when I finish, women and niggas say ""Damn, Tone""
That's busted
Bust it out, chant chant
Common Sense you know is running things
Let's show you we know you run it down
You ain't seeing us though we running things
Yeah, you know they running things
[Ynot]
Usually I'm the second voice, this time I'm the first choice
In the rhyme, I'm no prancer, so what?
Momma mock me, here's your time to jock, G, don't jack me
Don't pack no axe like a savege
I ran track stars back to their crib, create craters
In there, I'm holding one for fun
One tht plays golf, can't raise play tennis
One plays croquet, and Blazay plays the cut
Still make the women say ""Hey""
Yodle lay hey hee hoo, in my way dead
Yo I lay she hoo, in my bed
Ask Common, I did your momma, nah I took it easy
Of hard hail, on a scale from 1 to 10
I'm rich, I own Ebony and Essence
And Essence say I'm strong cause with the pen I've been a Bad Boy
A sad boy, I call your girl 13 cause she's good
Should I say more? I see more, I see more
Sea shore to sea shore, I sell my yaght and play Yatzee
Ynot's the posse, dressing tight, yo I'm friendly
Who's the master, the weak-minded say I rock too strong
The short-winded say I rhyme to long
So niggas told me, ""Please let me go to the peasant""
No, let me stop, chow, baby
[Common]
Baby, baby, baby!
Kids call me coffee because I *jugga jugga jugga* drop!
And you don't stop, don't put on the red light
While I rock player, niggas I coach more than John Thompson
I'm in your town, George, I got it made like Florance
I'm getting bigger than the lips on Martain Lawrence
*Mmuah, mmuah* It's like, it's like this
A Sermon like Erick, did a B.A.P. just like Tists
Wham! I knocked you over, but can I get a witness?
I shoot the gift rapping, and wish you a Merry Christmas
With he quickness is how I rip this, can you dig it?
Well if not, then dig this, this is the way that I flow
The pimp of hip-hop, I make you say ""Ho!""
Don't hear me knocking, like I said, like I said
And this is the story about a man named Jed
Got some lead for those hefiers, yo I rip it out
My weapon, double decker, I come from 187
And I do work undercover like a cop
Stop in the name of Com before I break your arm
Plus I'm down with the U-Ack and Bushman
Peace to the Beatnuts, peace to the Pharcyde
Yeah, you know what time it is
Yeah, that's how it is
(The silliness continues til the end)

One day  I was tryin to be myself
The same day this thug say  ""You gotta come hard""
Nigga  times is hard  I'm tryin hard to make it
It ain't hard to tell  it's hard for me to fake it
Plus, it's hard to be me, its hard to stop drinkin
I guess it's hard for hard niggaz to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction that related to me
I hated to be, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggaz, be too hard to say ""ho"" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Might not have the murderous verse, but I stay hard to the chorus
Took this girl to work, she saying, ""Have a real job""
Like that dick you had last night, baby, I work real hard
Simple motherfuckers tellin me hard is criminal
Niggaz you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up

Shit'll happen to me, I gotta let niggaz know
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Yeah, I got a name, but only twenty dollars to it
Next album you gon' blow, but my ass, you done blew it before
Being in my video, what's that gonna do for your life?
Get you some pussy? You should be gettin rump off GP
Quit that you look like you say I seen you on TV
I be readin niggaz but readin be makin me sleepy (Hey!)
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggaz stuck on one and them-a ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right

This is new day and I gotta take it in

I'm Poe, as Edgar Allen
But I'm a poet when I'm freestylin
Ynot:
You got a design, masterwind, Not Never The Less
Fresh like L, addresss, yes the LS's here
I appear on piers with my peers
The Imperial like margerin, I'm butter
Yes like Bel-Air
Common Sense:
Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time
It's time for some perculator
I circulate around the block
Black to get me a six pack a half of Harrold's chicken
A good combination, when I get bubbly I do it in moderation
1 brew, 1 brew, I said 1 brew at a time
Ynot:
Well I'm a two timer of women that'll 3 times a lady
Ms. Haiti say Sade and my Ms.Golper say
""Yo whoop there it is"" call me E cause I equal MC's squared
In the bed marks know I got the key to get the girls
Noses open like the vapors, more pub than the papers
More papers than the press, oh yes I gets paid
Common Sense:
Yo, I didn't grow up up po po but once you get grown and out on your
own
Bills apon bills apon bills is what you have
Before you get your check than you already spend half
See I make money, money doesn't make me
I'm a reflection of my section and section 8
Ynot:
Enough, I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls
Where I have them comin' in (ugh) 8 seconds

Mine was better and now your deader, than a (door knob) eeea wrong

Dills like pickels, I'm fancy man like tickles LIKE (the french)
Not Johnny but like a Bench I press on like glue
I stand like Lee while you stagger like Lee
Most likely I'll gagger that bullish I pull ish like a magnet
A dragnet, I don't drag I gets net income, yo bums I rush like
adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush will get mushed like a
sleigh dog
I saw dogs who are under me, I over man, call me Doverman
Cause I'm a Pincer of pennies that's pretty, then you see green from
all money

I ment my mint, know what I mean? I'm nice
Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman

Ok there was a black man a white man and a chinnese man
The black man of coarse he was po (yeah)
THe white man. He was rich (uh ha)
And the chinnese man, he owned a store (alright c'mon)
Ok the blackman lived on Beech Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
And the chinese man's store is where they all meet
Not really on the good foot
Because the white man kept steppin' on the black man's toes
And in his shoes there were holes
But the white man didn't care, shit he didn't have to wear it (uh ha)
He scratched that pad he got from his parents, with his tight ass
He would of been poor white trash, but anyway
Everyday the blackman would ask for some spare change
But Adam, the white man would stare strange
So the black man got fed up
cause wasn't nobody feedin' him and feedin' him
And took red by his neck and started beatin' him and beatin' him
The chinnese man got noyd and broke out like a peon
And now the blackman own the store and the name of it is Leons

Barbeque that is. Rib tips hotsuace, mild sauce, fries

Pushin' Cutlasses, dope, and other traditions
In the conditions of the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, the city, c'mon

So many raps about rims, I'm surprised @#%$ ain't become tires

You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich
I slap a @#%$ like you
And tell him Rick James bitch
Witcha Hollywood stories on porches
We poli hood stories on who became rich
And whatever light they hit, we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it, you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com has never been involved in Run
Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm hotta than the times, you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside, you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip hop is goin', a Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'

My old bird like, ""We ain't got no time for that!""
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
I rock the patchwork fast I'm in to win but then begin to sin
we're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
Beast for each and greet the meek with speech
to seek and peak cause Pete, shit gets deep
I fuh-fuh-freak, styles that come out
at night, when most cats pull the gun out
Go on and on and, to the break of when the

The simps, please uhh uhh uhh uhh
These studs mention me, uhh uhh uhh uhh
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
on the industry I came
With penitentiary talk, Coke and a Hennesey walk
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Time for war, my artillery caulks the hardest nigga
I'm killin 'em soft
Dealin with golf, gettin blowed on the course
I be dissin magazines, but then buy The Source
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
with a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
The way you want the game I rub off like Henner
I remain like a tattoo with natural raps
Copy like a fax that's y'all actual facts
Battle raps is where it began, I'ma end it wherever I land
I done thought of, a master plan, it goes
C to the, cold-blooded (yeah, c'mon)
cold-blooded, (ya know) hard-core

Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve
Trapped in a belly of hell
Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him
They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it
They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]
Or leave your whole life blank futured and caught

With sweat leaking from the outline of your soluid
Don't understand the point that you at

You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'
Summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from
Natural lifer, a soul he had to fight,
Learn it himself, sleep days, stay up half the night
Amongst dead man walking, he got afterlife exercising,
Developing his knack to write
Never leaving his cell, in this world he trapped himself
What he loved on the outside world, detached himself
You know the cards Blacks get dealt by the system
He drew a picture of freedom with many dimensions
This picture proved to be bigger than Black and White
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you
This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
Peace Ru

Treated me unfaithfully and now endure me painfully

The clouds clashed and the heaven's gave birth to star
God placed it in a man on the day he was born
Convicted minutes after, a true natural disaster
Framed for manslaughter, the Hurricane Carter rising
From out the south water, like torrential rains
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
You can't believe the world we live in's injust
All I see is more proof, there's no place for us
They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
Drive him to the point where the mind work mechanical
Or works by remote control
It was done to all of us, they tapped directly into our soul
Either it's sing-sing, or it's bars around your mind
There's no where to run, no where to hide
In a six-by-six a guilty man cries
For repentance and lost is what innocence is
Same story, same target, different time
Cyclical reaction from the prisoners of the bilnd
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind

I'm on some calm shit watch Com get complicated
Simple motherfuckers say the way that Com communicated
was too complex, I got a complex not to complain
on my brain no complain and so will my community
And I prefer compliments
So I complement at an angle, of ninety degrees
It's the ninties, and music got known for grease
I got a sense of direction and a compass
Come past MC's with compassion, though I heard the screams of
But I ain't shy, so why shall I comfort
Commiserate at the fort with Jeff I'm so ill
But I chilled in my compartment with no company and no meals
Now Com can get the panty, but I want my own company
And Com is on a mission not to work for commission
It's a common market and it's so much competition
but to me, competition is none
To my comp I'm a ton I get amped like Watts in a riot
my compact disc is a commodity, so buy it
Instead of competing with Pete
Com compromised, Com made a promise
Not to commercialize, but compound the soul
without the elements, compelling sense into Communism

I could tell that you set it there just to see how much I could hold
To see if I dropped the ball, get thrown in the cold
Just to see if I'd never call and shut up and grow old
But even then I'd have to listen to all of these preachers in my path
I will be sifting through their sermons just to conquer the mass
Until I reach the top of the hill and look out on disbelieving eyes
Just to say I'd had my fill of all of the heavy breaths and sighs
But who am I to begin when there's never an end
Was it just for the sake of sin that you became my friend
and left me dangling there to blow in the wind
Well I'll be damned if this ever happens again
Chorus:
One day I'll be a dancer
One day I'll get in line
There was a man hummin' a tune shifting subway stares
And he conjured swear word gloom as the market traded shares
Your train pulled into its stop but you left without a care
Well for all you know he continued to curse everything you saw as fair
So then you wandered downtown to where you worked on time
but you can't kill him with your heart because he's etched in your mind
And it's a gamble now to go back and attempt to be kind
As if you didn't step on a crack everything would be alright
But that is the cross-hatch of a misconstrued mismatch
This is the misconception we so discreetly attach
I am the ball and you are the catch
And I caught you in all of your gall
But it was to late because you hatched

One day I'll be a dancer
One day I'll get in line
There was blood on the tax report and it dripped from your noes
I was careful not to let it get all over my clothes
You see it permanently stains, yep that's how it goes
But then what would be the portrait without the pose
You see it's all in those sad eyes that glare down upon my wrists
The blood flows over my hands to my fingertips
And we all pick so hard at those pimples 'round our lips
That we tend to forget that these models really do exist
So then what can be the answer to question of this breeding cancer
Well I'll tell you mine, I resolve to be a dancer
I'll strip down naked every Saturday night
And you'll pay me not to step on a crack and every thing will be alright
Chorus:
One day I'll be a dancer
One day I'll get in line
One day I'll bear this empty spotlight

Mo'fucker move back, I pursue rap at the pace of a New Jack
Miscellaneous numbers and shoes stack grooves
Rap I deliver for the hungry and underprivileged
Something different from these hollow and grunting niggas
This is business strictly, step to my business is risky
'Specially when you as bitch as Missy
Back to back LP's that sound the same, I surround the game
With a four-pounded brainstorm
To make niggas dance in the rain, scared to take a chance in the game
Used to breakdance, it's a shame
What money do to a nigga brain
If he lose his soul what did a nigga gain?
""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)
My train of thought is that of a hustler, or a nigga with his shirt off
Trying to get his work off to customers
I rap with a chip on my shoulder, squeezing Coronas
See shirts that say ""We gotta get over""
That juggy shit is over, the war is on
I on;y want to be a soldier, I'm holding on, to a culture
Focused like Gordon Parks when it's sorta dark
For niggas that's flooded with ice, my thought's the ark
Performing warming arts with some shit for the heart
Don't fuck with radio, ignoring the charts
I could give a FUCK what you made in a year, nigga, you wack
A soft nigga on a hard track, in this new rap
Generation I ""X"" cats like a Muslim
He fell off cause I pushed him
Let his Bently and his weak crew be his cushion
I catch him on the streets, in front of the bodyguards and rush him
""Doin' it, doin' it, I am doin' it""
""C O double M O to the N"" (cut and scratched 4x)
You wasn't saying you was a thug before Pac came
Ten years ago you had a high top trying to be like Kane
Then Snoop released and it became a G thang
Claim sets, your city ain't got gangs
Niggas hate you, they ain't paying you no attention
In a circle of faggots, your name is mentioned
With six degrees, I separate MC's, from a business man that's good
From a nigga that was raised or just lived in the hood
From what a nigga says to what's understood
Keep my shit tight like them boys in ""The Wood""
Dick is always hard like the ""Boyz in the Hood""
Peace to Dug Inf, No I, Sean Lett, the whole Chi
At the crib some cats give me the cold eye
I'm a bitch slap the next one
Let him know the world is my section for taking
You got to reduce aggression

Enter this game with tricks and envy

Seein souls move forward

Here to save you all now rap ain't worth savin but I

Standin ovations for acapellas shitiations

Take an eye for an eye till the world goes blind I'm bovine
Raging bull words are my weapons hoping not over ya head like cangos in '87

What's funny motherfucker I wanna laugh too
But now I'm ready to get rich old dog new tricks
Told L could dig to China with chopsticks
When I switch to the big leagues this year with no fear
Cuz who'd even believe that I'd be here

Starin' down the barrel of a gun
The one I love is up with a silent crush
On everything under the sun
A child of roses, a pocket full of poses
She stands up to the call to attention
She pins up her petals on the row of scarecrows
And everything under the sun
Why would she drag faith along
Raking the shade indoors
'Cause in that shadow, winter might leave her alone
With everything under the sun
Hold me
As the morning sky blacks out
Hold me
There's no time left now for doubt
For the tinsel placed on an iron pine
Begging mother's milk to come
Electrifying sense like a neon sign
With everything under the sun
Now bouncing baby boy becomes a rolling thunder
Switching the nightlight on
And what passes on jade will have to settle for wonder
And everything under the sun
Now morning hangs over the engines of time
The streets flood with desolation
But the one I love, she clasps her tiny hands around me
And everything under the sun
Hold me
As the morning sky blacks out
Hold me
There's no time left for doubt
For the one I love's not instinct
No body had taken for ransom
No soldier marching in sync
To the beat of a tired anthem
My love, she is nothing
She's only everything
Everything under the sun

How did you know I been waiting for this time to come
And though it tastes like for ever it may not stay long?
Everywhere it's summer
A shaman since before my birth
And I came down to rock the earth
My mission condition:
I give you, you listen
Im syncing in time in parallel
In binary, no 3rd return
Im planning intention
With love the redemption
Chorus
No pop, no pop, no pop, no pop
We gon do this thang till the sky just drop
Lock into you mind away we rock
In a rocket is the 87th astronaut
Top of the soul, dove and I got in a hole
At the moment they were sayin
It was outa control
Strap into your mind
Why eyes see some recline
You'll see in time your season to shine
When the stadium is dark
MC's are defined
Get ready, on your mark, put your feet on the line
The race is on, to space beyond
You gon get there by doin what you want
Sometimes the most famous feel all alone
So we trip to a place that we call our home
I was known as being spaced and outa my dome
now I know, it all I've known

[Verse 1]
I was rollin' around, in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her?
Would I treat her the same? Would I still be runnin' game on her?
In what type of ways would I want her?
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body?
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex?
The lies, the greed, the weed, the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her, glory, I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful
[Chorus]
(sample) Faithful to thee
(sample) Faithful to thee
(sample) Faithful to thee
(sample) I'd like to be her very best friend
[Verse 2]
He worked with her, she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig, a wife, a kid, a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked, ""Why do men always have to stray?""
He said, ""I'm bad, not as bad as Eric Benet""
""I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'""
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought, and said, ""I'm tryin' to get my life together""
Went home to his lady, these were his confessions
""Baby you a blessin' and my best friend""

What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo

Check it, yo
You say a one for the trouble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh
(I can feel the funk)(x4)
Check it
I come to grips with mics
I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
Cold, so I'm lampin, with no need for spotlight
When I got light like an intersection, you talk
But you came to my town with protection
Election year, had the block hot
I scream ""fuck the world"" for having a baby girl sorta cock block
I write rhymes like I come from the windy city
With my crew, I click like simply, stand midi with reality
Casually, I walk through these war games
Some claim say but then they take on whore names
If that's the way your sex drives, stay in your lane
If you're a man, I can't tell like if the door rang now
Chorus:
Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggaz all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass
What you wanna do girl(wanna shout)
To the brothas when you come in a jam, it ain't a bunch of niggaz
It ain't high tech and ain't got free liquor
You jackin his name and stick to make you jones get thicker
What you wanna do man?(let go)
Yo, check it
Some niggaz be on the mic, sounding like dikes
Allow me to get on and bust like Spike(uh)
Lee, I'm in the majors with no rotation
Through stations of bullshit, I see through like a pager
In the age of Aquarius, various things
Is gonna carry us in intellect and what have you
Street astrologists interpret point stars and half moons
Then end up on garages or walls in bathrooms
Every black moon, a rap tune move me
The rap sun, I rain more than Rudy, that unruly shit is played
It don't stop
It's time to get it, get it made
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
I know how the underground tastes
I want a crib from the ground up, rooms spin at a round pace
Get down based on true story, through Corey, came close to the teachers
Colder as the Iceman, posted before it start wrinklin
Linkin with cats, who don't react to change in the years
Fulfill prophesies in rooms full of emptiness, now
Chorus:
I can feel the funk(x8)
Yo, check it, check it
I came through the corridor, with the aura
Raw Chicago mora, scope the horror
Read between the lines and know the border
Some pop wines for juice, I wait in the water
Waitin for you Big Willie niggaz to have a show at The Crib
We gon get with your glamour, long as we know where it is
Tell you ain't a player by your sweater doused with wack feather
The Crib got the gangsta playa shit patent like black leather
I rap better than you, you, or maybe him
But I am like a tree and every lyric is a timb
Spilled brews and greasy foods got my car smelly
Some be so high, they believe they fly like R. Kelly
But then they fall off, dusted niggaz is gettin sawed off
They fall soft, my mental lift is for me to haul off
I kick ass

I tapped out time on a bottle of rhyme
I watched you side-step across the thin-laced line

Two forgotten myths, both Achilles heels

So how can I ever run away

That you're still by my side

But everytime you see me smile
You think I'm paying you a lip service

After bein' 25, you know, just trying to survive in the world
Bout to have a little boy or baby girl. Who knows?
Anyway, just when you start gettin that little age and experience to you
You start thinkin about stuff...tryin to make the right moves
So bust it out, this is what I was thinkin, check it
Yo, the education of the Lon-chicka-Lonnie Lynn
Began, began with time
Bein my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brotha, you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the Devil's White
Well, the Devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight, with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone, but I can still see clear
As a child, given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus cuz for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge, happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen, Tao the lessons
Koran and the Bible, to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em, gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em, different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em, but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doin right and got you this far
Whether you say  in Jesus name  or Hum do Allah
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
Cuz when the trumpets blowin, 24 elders surround the throne
Only 144,000 gon get home
Only 144,000 gon get home
Only 144,000 gon get it baby
Chorus Cee-Lo:
I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pouring rain
found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me
Cee-Lo:
Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title
That their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously, seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
Cuz it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know
Who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently, White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we bein' lied to? I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn, somethin' in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search, my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only
Science and math are universal
Takin elder advice, read the Bible, the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on, this ain't right, Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
and it's all in the plan, but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So, with followin' I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man, the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind, there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and
Can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown, you make sure it's known, you make sure it's grown
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
If you God, then save your own, don't mentally enslave your own
Well, I've lived and I've learned
I've taken and I've earned
I have laughed, I have cried
I failed and I have tried
Sunshine, pourin rain
I found joy through my pain
Just wanna be happy...bein me

Know I love my baby, My baby loves me
Layin in some heaven, need a little company
Let's go into a heaven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto...
[Verse 1]
Searchin for a love, throughout the ghetto
Young girls is thick, righteousness is narrow
I got my third, eye on the sparrow
Want my peoples straight and rock sweet apparrel
The mother of my child, we not together
Baby it's your back, I got forever
As the weather, talks to us
Him rockin the Holy Spirit walks through us
The blunted eyes of the youth search for a guide
A thug is a lost man in disguise
The rise and fall, of a nation, even when the buildings tumble
I still stand tall, I walk through the valley, wit a life preserver
Feelin at times, that I might just murder
Yo but that aint what I was sent for
I want folks to say his life it meant more
Than any car, any rock, or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God
[D'Angelo]
Geto Heaven...
Standin in some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven...
Standin in some Geto Heaven

[Verse 2]
Love, your happiness don't begin wit a man
Strong woman, why should you depend on a man
I understand you want a man that's resourceful
If he pay your bills, he feel like he bought you
Talkin to a friend, about what love is
Her man didn't love her, cuz he didn't love his
Hugged her from afar, said what I felt
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cuz one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will annoint you
Goin through the storm, many bodies stay warm
That relationship died, for you to be born, you worth more
Than anything you could cop in a store
For you to grow he had to go so what you stoppin him for
Not even I could ignore bein alone it's hard
Find heaven in yourself and God
[D'Angelo]
I know I love my baby
My baby loves me
I'm layin in some heaven, need a little company, yeah
It's twenty four seven, time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven
Geto Heaven, Geto Heaven
It's time to get some Geto Heaven
Time to get some Geto Heaven, ohhhhhh...
[Verse 3]
This music is so much bigger than me
As far as happy, yo it's like a trigger to me
Dealin with crab rappers, and groupie broads
Record execs, at times it do be hard
But to choose words, and be heard across waters
Doin something you like to support daughters
Keepin your guys who collectin court orders
Conveyin messages that the ancestors brought us
Thought of things to say to become the end thing for the day
Somehow, that didn't seem the way for me to make it
Music is a gift that is sacred
I hope you didn't use it hopin you could grow to it
Whether servin or a surgeon, you gon go through it
Can't imagine goin through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie ?half? helped me see Lonnie's ?fath?
On my behalf, let's take whole steps to a ?ho tep?
And show depth, as we make people nod
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God

Geto Heaven, yeah, yeah
Geto Heaven, my baby
Geto Heaven, my baby

Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal

Underground under pressure, my style is the child
of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad
Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj
I take over breaks and chop loops
Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style pans the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough
and didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled
your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz
like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wipin your nose like you need blows
Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts fermented, I rode rhythms and words tinted
Many lip profess, I'm verb centered

Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims
Man these people still takin rappin for a joke

Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide
on the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype
Y'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's
shaky as SHIT!  Just need to come clean and admit
that yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless

Hey give it Boogie like the BX, sex regular booger bitches
get the backseat, G-bumps'll make you buy tapes
Ex-cape the fire tonight, switch like Jekyll and Hyde
and shit, wreckin we live and shit
This swamp water style'll keep em dirty and wet
I bet mills on the rhyme skills, we walk away set
Rich like topsoil, connect coin with currency
Places that I couldn't pronounce, and then bounce
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+
Study scrolls that includes the clause
Get your dirty paws out my bowl, your hustle's too old to deal
with the shuffle, you exhaust me like a muffle
Get zapped and zipped in the duffle
Came to the set splashed, no Roley on the wrist
To Hell with a guest list, we all up in this!
A two dollar somethin got your eyes on him
But yo she pinchin my ass so we go, limb for limb
Lights studio dim, it's EXACT tonight
So we can drop the Rap Delight, on one!
Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down

Underground under pressure, my style is the child
of a lesser, God, I Master like Farad
The sign of in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Metaphorically massage, verbal hajj
I take over breaks and chop loops
Glorifyin, one-eighty hat cats can rock in my troops
Wisdom like a tooth, mock new shits I knock loose
Datin game Thursday's I spot juice, Plug like Pos'nus
Before you get a style, let's get a style
My style has the crowd back and forth
You were soft as the tracks you rappin off, I pop shit
You tried to laugh it off, actin like you had to cough
and didn't hear it, my spirit sustains in the same pattern
emcee, familiar sample period; spottin where you sampled
your rhyme scheme from -- I ain't clearin it
I drop science and experiment -- contractually
came to terms of endearment with my label
Want to pick out a day to smack wack niggaz, I contact niggaz
like P.O.'s, you spit background lyrics, I rip Lee flows
Wipin your nose like you need blows
Claimin it's a allergy, I react allergic to cats
or is it how they word it
If you had weight it must have been some pussy you served with
Thoughts for a minute, I rode rhythms and words tenant
Many lip profess, I'm verb sentences
Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
Just get on down..
[Pos]
It's like rip y'all, add it on to lip
Wonder Why's upon this, just to flex my strength
I was the one who killed wackness so I had to do a bid
of twelve years on the mic, before parole with Tommy 'Kid'
Infinite landscaper, green paper maker
Leap far from home with chrome rims and trims
Man these people still takin rappin for a joke
The pimp, I rock it one-double-oh percent
Some of you MC's should be called CM's, Carbon Monoxide
on the mic exposin your polluted bloodtype
Y'all niggaz need a visit from the Brain Fairy
Walk around dead, like your physical's buried
Wrote the rhymes durin a earthquake, cause your style's
shaky as SHIT! Just need to come clean and admit
that yo' quick draw fails the test, and mine was flawless
My DJ gave the scratch, yours was clawless
Your crew couldn't even measure to mine
That's why yo' bitches is busted, and mines is fine
Performin with an upper design, so back on off the plank
We bringin this Big and Bad like Hank
Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
Just get on down..
and just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down

Just dance, ah come on and get down

Chorus
Nothing you could do
They say he's a radical, he don't fit the game
A heart full of glory and a fist of pain
A couple of battle scars but shit's the same
Are you not entertained
So all the onlookers and the bystanders
Wait til intermission, run buy your camera
Record the moment, cause it'll be platinum
And you could say you seen Common rock the stadium
I was told by a wise old to come from the heart
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
The dark knight to spark mics, and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard, am I loved or feared
A beast amongst boys like Paul I'm revered
Vroof, vroof vroof vroof vroof Vroof vroof well
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
You frail on the mic like you might break a nail
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat girl who broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Artell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the end that failed
I rebel, NYSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mandela
Chorus
My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
My life is the style I stay dressed to kill
A legend like Will Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My rhyme style is blind, it's all in the feel
Touch it and watch the blood fall with the steel
The weak raps you wrote you could call that your will
My drive VROOM is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
Crashed I survived it, gashes over eyelids
You easy to take out cause you hot garbage
I'm amped like wattage, the truth nigga honest
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up
Chorus
Feet in the dirt, blood on the shirt
Scars over bars, symbols of the work
Tight clothes the armor, center of the drama
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Some of you model bitches is so overrated
Don't mean to underrate it but damn it I made it
In the water I waded on the corner I painted
Draw blood like we related
MCs get de-decapitated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
Mr. Excitement, change your face up like a white chick
Then light shit up like a dread with the herbs
Get sex in the city and head in the burbs
These are the words of a radical
The crowd applaud, I'm bowed, I'm proud
To be the gladiator
Chorus

Messenger in the Metropolis; +Apocalypse+ here and +Now+
Niggaz know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggaz drown the deeper the verse gets
Deep as a skinny girl's cunt - I surface with the purpose
to let y'all niggaz know the demo
Voice is a instrument that's monumental
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye
I identify with dobbs and weaves, and niggaz makin moves
that bob and weave, and niggaz with jobs on the side sell weed
I feed off the hunger that a bum or abandoned child gets
freaky, like Marv Albert, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Got a clip for these niggaz on the net, sellin my shit
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
and people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything - like they say to they girl
How you bringin it when you sit indian style?
Niggaz know me as Com it's time hear me go wild
with HOT SHIT, yeah..
HOT SHIT, yeah, one two..

Old men see visions young men dream dreams

Com Rules Everything and everything is
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his
Scary the biz is like ""The Blair Witch Project""
Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project
State senators, life twirls, most sell out
- like a dread with a white girl
You want me to cypher with you and the Gods?
I just did a show - I'm pursuin these broads
Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck
Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dutch scuffed and scraped up
Taped up for tryin to say what - ever you was about to say
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say
feel my heat in the night - it leaves you without the day
What I write is a passage for niggaz to travel through
Before defeatin me - Joe, you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
Shame I gotta do white labels to keep my life stable
I write fatal bringin niggaz to life
A wise man came in the thick of the night
He said BRING THAT SHIT when you pick up the mic
I said, ""What shit?""
He said HOT SHIT, hot shit, hot shit

phone rang, screen said caller ID said blocked,
but for some reason i decided to answer it.
on the other end was a french accent.
he told me we needed to rap quick,
cause he had did some bad shit,
and would be gone for years, spending these last two days,
with his momma and his kids
when he spoke I wasn't trying to hear it ,cause
I knew he was a real good person,
and this didn't seem like it was in his spirit.
he couldnt believe as much as i couldnt, what he done .
he said now its time for him to turn himself in.
no longer could he run, from life, from God.
start thinkin, why is doing right is so hard.
I got back to him when we was inLondon discussin the new testament
and how our lives related to it, and how we could make the best of it.
my voice became destined, so I asked him why you gotta go.
he said you know turn to Matthew 24
he said no one knows the hour, nor do they know the day,
but the kingdom is near, don't let anything lead you to stray.
as long as God is with you, everything will be okay.
so right about then,we decided to pray.

Hi hoe, or bye hoe, if you're lookin for a sucker

Pucker your lips, do flips like Mary Lou
Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'ma marry you
Bury you, I will do, after, I bill you
Kill you, hoe, cause your shit smells like mildew
Pe-ew, think you need some soap and a rag
Or better yet Black, Flag, you scallywag
Tag, I didn't mean to diss dis... hoe butt
But you need to stay such, do not touch
Much disrespect goes out to you
And your parents, too, for havin you
Haven't you been introduced to a douche
I guess you said fuck footloose, and got pussyloose
No juice, you shoulda dried up, like a prune-a
Mister mechanic this place needs a tune up
For the pink cadillac cause it's block is off
And have more use, than a public park
for recreation, givin up the body is a hobby
I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it)
Hoe hoe hoe, Merry Christmas
Aiyyo JuJu, I just had to diss dis

Careful to catch a tiger, after you catch a tiger
you can catch a hoe, there's your hoe, kiss a hoe, fuck a hoe
Diss a hoe, I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago
Hablo ingles?  I don't know espanol Joe
I can go the line plus a hundred like Flo Jo
Homo's a nono, so faggots, stay solo
I roll my dick so it holds just like a Rolo
Total recall, yeah I see y'all
I see you, I see you're a freak too, so peek a boo
I'm prickin you whether or not, took you out that's work see
So get your skirt see, and bitch, dirty
Curtsey, dosey-do out the do' slut
This is what I come on, so slut you better grow up
Slow up, you forgot your earrings here take em
Salami beef and ham with the asalaam alaikum
Like that hoe (that hoe) that hoe (that hoe)
Dabba-da-dat, it's like that hoe
[Chorus]
Sittin on the dock of the bay, I say hoe
Say hoe?!  (Hoe!!)  Do you know, do you know?
Bo knows this hoe blows much much dick
An undercover trick, a toe a tac a tic
Naked at, frick-a-frat, plus her puddy wat
C'mere k-k-k-k-k-k, yo c'mere you little puddy cat
What, your booty black is so indespicable
You squaw-pie, tack-haired, motherfuckin jiggaboo
You can suck a dick or two or three or four or mo' here
But first get curlin iron burns off your forehead
My nigga Coe said, that you're an around the way girl
You're fuckin everybody around the way, and been all around the world
And you still can't find yo' fate
But you had a couple of babies I mean a Bunch like Brady
The lady is a tramp snake hoe yo and all of that
Fuck her sixty-nine you get the eighty-six and don't call me back
Your black ass bunion
There's a party in your mouth BITCH, and everybody's comin

It was once said by Black Thought that +Things Fall Apart+
Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart, the art of it made it interestin
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend, my man caught wind
This chick is payin me, it'll either cost me or cost him
Told her she shoulda lost him (when?) a while ago
Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her yo
I ain't here to start on this [nigga] for me to wreck his broad
you could tell what I thought of this [nigga]
Nickname was Smoke, don't know if that was cause of cigarettes
(or what?) or guns he tote, he called shots on the deck
so I wasn't tryin to call his bluff, by his persona
you could see, he think he tough!

The streets is watchin, out is one way I put myself in his Nike's
His position is, ""Aight man, somebody bonin my lady""
Probably snap like Rod-man
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki (when?)
'round four, when she was comin she would beep me
I sat deep in the corner, drinkin zombies, becomin one by now
Wonderin if my style would support her and her child
Out the corner of my eye saw this stud I recognized (who?)
One of Smoke's guys, to stay out of sight I tried
Told Jill Scott to meet we coulda picked a better spot

It ain't good lookin, like a black promoter I'm talkin bookin
Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him
But he was on the horn informin the rest of them hoodlums (aight)
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
was messed up, on Smoke's payroll was one-time
My pager went off, it read one line: ""Come get me
from Halsted,"" I'm thinkin this is monkey bar [shit]
Went to the phone quick, called her (what happened?) Her line was busy
Situation number nine, got my mind dizzy
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
I've been drinkin too strong to be thinkin too long

Niggaz know they can't fuck with this
Turn this shit up just a little more
I walk the night in rhymin armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searchin for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror
Mariel just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is gettin traded
I drop a gem off, them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so bangin niggaz say it's gang related
On philosopher's rink of thought, I've skated with precision
Crews is gettin split like decisions
Com will let it ride in collision
Vision like Coleco or tele, I battle stars in stellar...
Regions, my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now, it's teethin
My reason of rhyme applies to season and time
Season of mind, body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts, I'm leavin the swine
Verbal vegeterian, squashed beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggaz I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material, imperial and rugged like
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile, like a hug, I'm tight
Skip ladies, this is rip a muthafucka night
Oracle arouse, niggaz don't even run for cover right
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second comin
Hummin comin towards you with power like forwards do
Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm Explorin you
So, wack niggaz be cool, with them, I stay cordial
Flowin room temperature, cats is presumed miniature
Like golf. Soft like Tiger Woods
And real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dike broads to Set it
I levitate to the occasion, lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deletin and less savin
A praise in hell, raisin heaven
Like the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one
You will on day seven
""Hungry hip hop junkie in the city"" (*scratched 3X*)

[Chorus: Jill Scott]
Can you speak your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most of believing the magician
But you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I (I)
I (oh I)
I
Appreciate what you give to me
Yeah (I)
I (oh I)

Appreciate what you give to me
[Verse 1: Common]
People say I got soul look at all the records I hold
The lives I've affected, connect and control
With me in your basement, your mama got blown
I provide the vibe to keep the strippers on poles
Through me the black experience is glorious told
From a school that's old bold, so I rock gold
And platinum, so cats I hold notes and cash for them
On streets I rap for them, in ghettos I blast for them
Mash with them, at the party and all
Peep the universal language that's embodying all
Put the Billie Holiday, Bob Marley in y'all
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System, with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks wax CDs and tapes
I am music
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
You can feel me all over alive, I help culture survive, I opened the eyes of
many
Styles y'all wrote in the skies, with your lows and highs, open your mind to
hear me
CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS
In the streets I beat cops and obsolete
On every station it's hot you can't stop my heat
I taught J and Dre how to rock the beat
On what's going on today yo, I gots to speak
I take the stand, yo you could feel me bam
Whether in Larry Graham or Steely Dan
Live I be killing it man
For how long I survived yo I'm realer than man
Got a soft side but I'm still a man
For me women cry and children dance, I'm trying to eat
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
I am music
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I been here since the beginning
Beginning of time yo beginning of time
Deep in the mind of the ancient ones
Everybody love me like they do the sun
I shine at times yo at times I'm dark
You can't categorize me, my mind's a art
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
I'm the one you roll with when your ride is smart
The change that came, the change that comes
I change with chords and I kick it with drums
Get blow with horns and did it on the one
Riffed for guitars, for the Lord I sung
Spun around the world at parties and weddings
Wherever I go I create the setting
You know me from lessons or your pops collections
Whether whole or half stepping I'm a blessing
Yo I am music

Because of jealousy then a man go under

I ain't claiming Mister Right
I'm a grown man, I'm too old to fist-fight
I stay on point like trick dice
Tweeking like the sound man who need to switch mike
Sounding bitch like
I know the block is hot, but we just can't get ice
When our children's children sit nice?
I sing the song to make the fiend's strong

I met this girl, when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school, when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
ont he regular, not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her
But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggaz, had did her in the park
But she was there for me, and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
and just cool out, cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone, wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
because we related, physically and mentally
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh yo, when she was underground
Original, pure untampered and down sister
Boy I tell ya, I miss her
Verse Two:
Now periodically I would see
ol girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started gettin thick quick
DId a couple of videos and became afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about, stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
in a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin, so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in L.A.
And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black, was goin out of style
She said, afrocentricity, was of the past
So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her, she was becomin well rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell, by how her titties hung
Verse Three:
I might've failed to mention that the shit was creative
But once the man got you well he altered the native
Told her if she got an energetic gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs lickin rock and dressin hip
And on some dumb shit, when she comes to the city
Talkin about poppin glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it
That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back hopin that the shit stop
Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop

He gonna get down for y'all Chicago style
Eighty-seven, you know the bidness, check it

After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking
After eight years of my life, of smoking and drinking
The world keeps spinning, so lately I've been thinking
Verse One: Common
Nearest to the go gothic, a cash flow prophet
Methods of gettin scratch and talkin slick I've adopted
Palms in the lock with stunts whose hearts be game
Hoes in the stable, none do I claim
Niggaz with nothin to shoot for, at they only aim
Gramps in the choir singin it's gonna rain
in the midst of precipitation, I make the power
manipulations, so my offspring'll be straight for generations
Got connections in the nation
To incarceration, to general population
More lyrics than Jason, look me in the face when you speak to me
You got a tattoo?  Bitch youse a freak to me
Seeking the, good sess material
Asking when's my next video
Bitch get a job and get your ass in somebody's university
Enroll your youngun in a nursery
And cleam him up, comb his hair, cover yourself
You want a man to love you you ain't loving yourself
I'm discovering wealth watches wisdom in ways
To make it in the last days, now bring it on
Chorus
Verse Two: Sean Lett
I feel blessed I survived two decades in this world
Then Ninety slid in naked now I got a baby girl
Ain't this a bitch, myself still a child
I want to hang on eighty-seven corners act wild on Stoney Isle
Better school her, so presence is your seed in society
Parks of envy jealous niggaz crack fiends yes indeed
I won't misleed and you can best believe
I'm just a blink away shorty anytime that you need
See I know right now, you're just too young to understand
Asking questions, why pops and moms don't be holding hands
Don't you worry about it yet, in due time we'll explain
Why having you, created just an everlasting shame
Bringing joy witcha smiles, tripping when you first walked
Knowing somebody's child is gettin outlined in chalk
Just relieved it ain't you, I got much love for you boo
Cause it ain't nuthin that these skanless niggaz in these streets won't do
Stop me if I'm lying, see my race is steady dying
Short methods to making cream, bullets sprays and shatters dreams
See basically, Chi-town's game-related and designed
Niggaz store up theirs and down opposite signs
Chorus
Outro: Sean Lett, Common
It's like that y'all (yeah yeah)
Common Sense and dirty mizer on the set y'all

We gonna get down like that
My man Eddie C on the board
We coming through y'all for eighty-seventh street
Seventy-first and everybody in South show
We coming through for niggaz on the West side
Down in the ickies, all up and down state
We gonna keep it straight like that
We straight out for gold
You call it Chi-town it's still our town
Holding it down like this with that eighty-seven sound
We talking about rocking niggaz state to state nationwide
On the real it's like that
Straight up South side is where we loaf
Shit be real around these parts, I'm serious

Night Blows, Stoves don't work, Hoes at work
A warrior, so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was,I spend a day buzzed
Trippin on heights, wishin for nights in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy,shown by the caddies
Uncles named Larry, that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
Raised by niggaz named Butch through the bay bay
With waists so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they, motto This is Chicago in the hay day
Similiar to Good Times, I guess that I was Jay Jay
A skinny nigga, young girls with penny figures
So many niggaz, stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us, these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang, ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads then the dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home, now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga, same block, same shit they own
Only thing different, quicker, they click that chrome
In my defense, yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man, I'm good workin with my hands

Lost, nobody found us, the force that sorrounds us
Ain't with us, they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from earth, only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin her body, wish she knew what it was worth.
Between God and trash, lookin in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head, to milk niggaz she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary, amongst theives and base-heads
Said it was her toes, but I could tell her soul hurt
She was colder (?), growin up she got to know hurt
very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her step-father that he was aite, so her mother he striked
she got to like like minded niggaz, who liked crimes and figures
Doin white lines and liquor, see hard times had kicked her
In the ass, it used to be thicker
Life is fast, some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap, blacks done lack
Self-esteem, yo we forgot the dream
On our jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme

Be high when you low, be on time but knowin to go
Be cautious of the road to college, takin a detour through vietnam or the middle east
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves

So throw your hands in the air and say hell yeah
I Can Beat Mike Tyson, plus I'm Fresh-er than the Prince of Bel Air
And I Blossom, In Colour is how I'm Living see
some pretend to be afraid of me but they're my Public Ene-ma
Picture this, like a cinema; I'm winnin a contest
I knew you was a loser when you bought your girl's prom dress
I'm just, another one of the nigs, take a swig
I can sing, brothers'll work it out without a gig
The gold mud in my blood, I'm a stud smokin blunts
Not a fuddy dud if rhymes were pecks, I'd be Woody Wood
They're after pestly hoes and that's the hoes I sex and don't collects
Rockin a Rolex, prefer Wrist Ex instead of Solar Flex
but I pump skill, to build what I can build and still feel good
The baddest hoes be sayin, ""Oooh you're real good""
Fella a city dweller, it's poison salmonella
Auntie's name is Stella, style as def/deaf as Helen Keller
Nail a flammer with the Hammer for comin incorrect
not with his grammar or bad mamma jama similar, to Bruce Banner
So don't get me angry, or maybe you won't like me
Kid just in the nick I kick more ass than Bruce Lee's Nike's did
Just in the nick I kick on the geek stick, flick a Bic
Dick a chick, Slick-er than Rick around the clock I tock to the
tic tac toe, rip up my rhyme my mic's my lasso
Shit, I got rhymes comin out my asshole
I'm in a pole position sole position you're in no position
to be dissin it's a, Rainbow Coalition
I'm kissin ass, goodbye, rockaby, here's your lullaby
like Georgie Puddin Pie but baby baby don't, cry
Feed em I heat em and eat em if I don't need em then I leave em
as leftovers, packin the weak MC's into ?septober?
Til I was older, I couldn't hold a rhyme folder
Now I dare ya to try and knock this mic off my shoulder
If I'm sober I won't hold a skunk, but when I'm drunk
I might let her bunk in my bed, heads be sayin I'm a hunk
Like a duck I'm slammin ham MC's MC's I'm servin
Makin the people jump like my man... Julius Erving!!!
Those deserving props are gonna get theirs
Grip, there's something on your lip, oh that's my dick hairs
I'm the biggedy biggedy Bear ya scrub Cub with a demo tape
Tryin to catch me catch your breath before you hyperventilate
for air you gots it, your best bet is to take an aspirin
I bash it, crash it now you know so stop askin
Cause when you ash I'll make an ass of you and only you see
Just in the nick I kick the funky shit
that's why they call me Bootsy

We dealin wit some very critical and crucial times
Some of the most critical and crucial times I've ever seen
I wrote Stoney Island on my guy
He was tryin me about the S-I-E experience
Tried to tell him about the C-S-E experience, you know?
Yo I'm the rap profession, I go the session
Study MC's like a god do lessons
Mic testin in the rain, I brainstorm
You feelin me out nigga? We got the same form
I drop heavy in spots you scared to put your weight
There's only so much ice you can skate on
Shit cats right for you, you say wrong
No time to debate on, who's your pop and who's not
Or who shot Big and Tupac
Or who this stud fuckin or how much this crew got
That's hoe shit
That ain't me or the type of niggas I roll wit
I Cold Get Dumb, like a brother in prison
Who hasn't had a chance to hold his son
Sacrificin like Abe did his oldest son

In shows I get more hoes/holes than a seam in the matt
Raps develop like film (so what?) so call me Instant Common
This business of pimps and hoes, I stick out like Bishop Juan
Talk to my nigga Ron about openin shops
Holdin up cops, I'm from the 'Go, it don't stop
Contract ain't show enough options, it's time to pop guns

[Chorus]
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
[Verse 1]
Yeah, you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's, real niggaz express and taste it
At crap games, black dames and big faces
Cases in court, fam' showin' love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now, now I know to go within
At time it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end
Yo
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love, hopin' it would come one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of actin' in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Tryin' to find herself again, much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us, to it some of us react as a slave
Funny, we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw, is he actin' afraid?
Everybody loves sun, why do I attract shade?
Heard of the love of money, but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man
Uh
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in, fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it, having broad limits
In the game of life, it's the scrimage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people, love always
Yeah
[Chorus]

Gotta watch out for them critters
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live huh (x4)
Verse 1:
I was born in Chicago raised on Planet Rock talking zsa zsa zsa zsa,
Catch knock my tape like beats (uh), I'm fresh as fruits,
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke, repent
You burn up you got me bit, I'm coming as ebit
Got on big hoes at Freaknit, frequently your telling me
Won and worn your rockets, so, he ain't put no scratch in my pocket
Yo heard, with my head I cock it, and rock it like that brother in
Colors
Cause I want y'all to live, my crew is 2 Live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (what?) it's just another case of that
2
dollar MC
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight to you they wrinkled but to my
they
straight
Now I'm straight are you straight? I'm straight as long as I got beer
I thought about it jack, and now I'm out of here
Hook:
""Maintain the rock""
I get the party live, Common Sense will get the party live, huh ""Don't
stop
the rock"" (X4)
Verse 2:
I need me some new socks, I need me some new drawers
I draws attention, like a letter to a sargent
Theres A Few Good MC's the wack I'm giving code red
Slim say I got nobody but when they see me at the party they be like
""Go head, go head"", cause I gots the cuts like Bobby, rappers are
dickheads
Choppin' they demo, I do it like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5, while you avoid the party I make it
live
The fellas nod and the chicks dance
While I'm coolin' in my jumpers and my big pants
I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Now a days blacks don't know how to act, besides Larry Fishburn
Charles Jug and Wesly Snipes, marks wanna test me because I test the
mics
I check 'em like sound, and like loose I'm down
Plus I done got better since Soul By the Pound, I maintain
Hook (X4)
Verse 3:
I fall fresh apon the spirit, with the lyric that's overwhelming
And house more hoes then Spellman, worse unwelcome like James Johnston
My brains sponcering speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondaling, they try to settle out of court
But I, could never be bought, what type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught, you wack together we fought
Cause I can't see my melons boxing if he's not boxin' with 'em
I don't care who started it, I'm gonna be apart of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them
I got rhythm from some boogers and some foxes
But if I becomes a 10 then some brothers all some gin
And I got juice, and this niggas scared
I'll F your head up, like the L.A. 4, when I flow for cash I got for
broke
like Mel for Moore
Why should a male with a B8 get more then me?
When Rashid got an MC degree, and a doctorine in rockin' shit I go to
docs
to get
A fishwish with cheese, I don't mix with MCs, cause I just don't like
the
mother____
But I'm still maintaining

Canibus and Common:
That's double for niggaz who ain't mathematically aware
(Rakim from ""My Melody""(To catch another sucka duck MC out there)
Common:
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken hearted bitch
Don't give no fuck who yo team or who you startin with
Cameoed or charted with, I house niggaz like apartments with
Mic mechanisms, I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcisim, fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got not get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
Canibus:
I'm creatin the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Puttin together them whether my rhyme one threat at a time
So you niggaz need to stop testin me
Cuz you know you can't ""F"" with me
Steppin to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposin yourself to the verbal radiations
Sayin you can defeat me is nothin but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggaz be diggin my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle?
I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggaz couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MCs will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
What!

Common, steppin to me is like going to the county being a neutron
Common, I ain't scared of no nigga
Common:
I persue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed, players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice, taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggaz I'm dunkin like when cops mingle
Fuck hip hop jingles, rhymin big words and not sayin shit
The click that you came in with accent your flavor wit
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggaz off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for, the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper who's career
You could only take a glance, couldn't make the transition
>From B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference, the humbleness
But in the Chi, bumbleless
Was thinkin as a weakness were poetrys in motion
Like a bitch, I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
(scratching)Fuck with Canibus(x4)
Canibus:
Yo, the Canibus is an animal with a mechanical mandible
Comin to damage you, spittin understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead sharp peripheral
With 360 degree visual
When the signal was given, MCs get biten with venom
>From a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em, way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source
It belongs on the shroud of turan, for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshippers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this
The lyrical verbalist, trash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap, get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black, try to battle me, you won't last
I'll turn your ass into the artist formerly known as, you gay ass fag
I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
So phat to be a rap star, takin pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me
Because they saw me, up in The Source chillin on page 40
Put this in your CD-ROM
www dot Canibus dot com
You can find me on the internet talkin to chicks
That was sweatin me off the Music Makes Me High remix
I be talkin mad trash tryin to get 'em to laugh
See, if I click and drag long enough, I'll get the ass
Bring it bag to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave.
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do, liquid aluminum like the T2
Beast from the East part 2, comin to see you
Common:
It's time I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared
Canibus:
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

Since I made the name Com Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggaz is scared, I'm your worst nightmare squared

This the city of Chicago
The state of confusion
The style I'm using is free
Or at least it would be if my mind was
Peep I'm behind cause
I didn't handle my function while in high school
Although I was cool
The hood I live in ain't that proper
Cause a cop a stop ya
And have you at a hundred and eleventh before you can say not guilty
I'm not filthy
Nor am I rich
Ain't that a bitch
Like life is
Not your wife is
See that your better halve
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
And all I have to hold
Is my self pride
So these streets I strive
Like a Black Panther
Asking can the
situation get much worst
All I do is try to appeal to the masses
As the phrase keep it real passes
The teeth of too many phoney individuals
Snakes, that smooth like criminals
They create chemicals
That the Earth hate
Doing their damndest to decrease my birth rate
I'd settle for lesser knowing I'm worth wait
Or at least my weight in precious gems
So I'm steadily steadly steadly
Trying to lose my religion, like R E M
Created in His own image so are we him?
And through all this crises
Shid(Shit) I wonder where Christ is
Well he damn sure not in K town or the wild hundreds
Where they broadcast G.D. till the world blow-up
And Stone run it
Hunted by police for display in state vile cages
Come out to make minimum wages
And with a desiese that are contagious
It is fucking outrages
The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up
But the Most High encourages me to put the glock up
And Stock up on do for self knowledge
A brother couldn't afford to go to collage
So I had to learn form the school of hard knock
On the hard blocks of the Chi
Even I, think about moving out to River Oaks
As my liver soaks
In mad Hennesy
Cause I got a bad tendency
To do a lot of drinking
Now I do a lot of thinking
Blinking, was your third eye
When you heard I
was one of the chosen one
Industry doors keep closing
(sing) Watch the closing doors
Niggas want a record deal
But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch
Like a sissy
Please miss me
With all that bullshit you popping
This knowledge I'm gonna keep dropping
Even if you had one of them red octagon
Motherfuckers say Mylik how you make your living?
I say by breathing oxygen

Raised in the temple of Chi, taught to look into the eye

In the place (for you and yours) to be
Da uh da uh, we got the uh ya'll
We bout to rock ya'll, we got the uh baby...
Yo yo yo check it
Excite-ting, enlight-ning, invite-ting
I'm writin shit that I feel
Raps are Black Steel In the Hour of commotion, the motion of Com
Is like that of a ocean, devotion cuz I'm
The Earth, Wind, and Fire of hip hop
By Rakim and Short I been inspired
My shit knocks environ---ments
of cats wit seventeen's tint, time is money
The mind is funny, how it's spent on gettin it
It's sittin wit descendants of Abraham
Who say the jam is  Money, Cash, Hoes
I went from bashful to asshole to international
Lover-self, word to the mother on my last record cover it's felt
Now deal wit it
Chorus: Bilal
I wanna get into it
Let's do this

Can you feel the music
The music oh ah, can you feel the music, the music
[Common]
Yo check it yo
In this never-ending battle to please
Niggas, magazine writers, MC's
Who request hot shit, I freeze
And tell em where I was rose, we always said cold
Hold your Horses and ya Carriages, this never-went-gold nigga
Rocks shows care-less
You not gon' respect self, at least respect the heritage
Affect the lives, the spread of wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day, I gotta carry this
And beats, rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had Dreams of Fuckin R amp;B broads, it came true
Journalist I wreck, shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I MC
Familiar voice, come to find out the angel was me
Some say  You changin, Rashid
Times are, we still close
I rhyme far, away away away
From what you accustomed to hearin everyday, uh-ah
You know the dope-choppin, gun-poppin, homies dyin
I'm amongst it, save the war stories for Private Ryan, INI
Chorus
[Common]
Yo check it yo
Women cry, children laugh, men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans over
Weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posin like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay MC's, just don't come around me wit it
You still rockin hickies, don't let me find out he did it
Got My Eyes on the Tiger, Eyes on the Prize
Eyes on the thighs of Mary J. Blige, imagin on how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat, lost weight, but I still rap husky
My verse depth is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing, invitin you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop Range/range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a Range/range when it's time to head home
Chorus 2x

We be that, we be that

Yeah! The war zone. Who you fighting for?
[Verse 1: Common]
It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
loud like shot that come from a glock
Pick up your mind, run from the spot
Revolution jumping in the parking lot
Shit is so hot that the sun watch
Children by the window with the gun cocked
they could get robbed and stop the luck (?)
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
I lock into a....
rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
Experiment in stereo loud so crank the system
For the humble on the path I paint a vision
How far will a nigga go just for attention
And to be remembered, you forgot the mission
Listen!
[Chorus: Laetitia Sadier]
All traces of life
in our gats we carry
that's used to dress humanity
([Common:] it's a New Wave, Come on!)
[Sung in French]
All traces of life

[Verse 2: Common]
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
for the people to make or wait it's better
in a room called real I stay forever
Everyday I lose something I gain forever
Meditate on how I can change the weather
My brainstorm for some it's like (?) umbrella
where bullets and lies both spray together
My mind scream like Al Green ""Let's Stay Together""
How could a nigga be so scared of change
That's what you hustle for, for the currency exchange
Ya'll rich, we could beef curry in the game
out your mouth, ain't nobody hurrying my name
You seen what happened when the Com go BANG
Wouldn't have a shot, even at a gun range
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of thangs
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Common]
From a land of shit talk, boy stars and pitch forks
didn't really see white until I went North
Getting bent on backyards, wishing in the air for a black god
Where people fix cars and clap hard
and look to the stars for rap jobs
I walk through the black fog with reflectors on my boots
smelling war near, I'm connected with the troops
that master anger and ain't afraid to shoot
through poured liquor fallen angels they salute (Whew! Whew!)
Feel the wind blow
A new wave- people with their hair trimmed low
It's two ways living in this world of techno
This age can't really save the ghetto
I pause for the rebels who rock heavy metals
and tell them that they're pharoh so let go
Come on!
[Chorus]

And check it out, ha.
Verse 1:
My raps do laps around tracks to the days
The idiot vibin', I'm the comma comma Chamelion
I use to pop the willy on my blue and gray sting ray
It had maxed, I was with bitches that had coochie
Bassum wasn't rollin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed their figures
Ain't 7 steps in the jam, next the police come
Heist there would be one, numbers I would get at least one
We come to the get together with whatever
You wouldn't know how deep it was, we all did shit together
Eat up all your vittles, drink your brew and then step to
The next cue, let's do it again y'all
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicage and Fun Town and shorties we run round
Play strike outs till sun down, but the shit ain't as fun now
And the city is all run down, we troop down to Jew Town
Talking cat down on some gear, have enough for a Polish incom fair
I stare, at what use to be Bubbles and think about who use to cop our
liquior
(Who?) Our neighborhood father figure
Hook:
I'm out with my crew, ain't nuthin' to do but ah,
""Niggas be rollin'"" - Ol' Dirty Bastard from Protect Ya Neck

Verse 2:
I got more rhymes then the Manor got folks had style
Since I went to McDowl, wearin' boats
And penny loafers know I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
It's like rain drops couldn't make our game stop
Skeeter will hit from the SAME spot
Torla tore my shit down, get down, put your body in motion
Only the strong survive, but on the 6 or the 5
Live as hot as sex use to be at the Racket
Wrong club with music by Andre Hatchet
Or either Beat Box Ferris at them country club parties
Would be hot as hell and house stud would get ""Find a body!""
Sawyers I would go there, hip hop clubs were so rare
I like the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Was said to have the best chicks but mostly High Park and V hoes
Is who I mess with, the best shit was troopin' to the loop
With your posisions held class crooked ass but still go the division
(I remember that) Over Yamela's crib while his old girl was at work
Bust a smoothie on the spread, but sill have some on your shirt
Hook
Verse 3:
I tuned into BMX and taped Farly on the tonemaster
I took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HBK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on the shore by yourself castin' stay up your act
What you could make of it, you was a gump they was takin' shit
Either fight or break for it, we go to the lake and get full
My drink there was Boons and Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avenlon, and being in a pool
I thought I was cool, with my ""members only"" and a bold fade
Wall to wall greens to get the sport gray and palmade
And soft breasts, as we got older we would star crush and bang fags
Go to Marshals and change tags, I snagged nuff niggas
And games are off the wall, in softball, Piggy one I would call
When I first got my three way callin', I caught Marsh tryin' to lie
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shot

Then I grew a little older and got angry at the world
For a while I spent my time getting all pissed off at traffic lights
But even that got boring you know it seemed so trite
These days I’m reserved to fulfill a quota
From a list I received from a man from Minnesota
....I got it off the internet, it read....
There’s a skyline in Oklahoma, stretches out over the corn
It can lead a horse to water, in the wake of the dawn
Catch a train from the desk in the office, give you more time to think
Ride it out to the bible belt, but hey man, will you drink?
At the age of six I’d ride piggy-back up the stairs
Into my room and kneel beside my bed to say my prayers
When I got older I found out about Santa and the Easter Bunny
Relieved about the boogie man but that Jesus rap seemed like another ploy for money
So with this and technology there’s a growing distraction
That connects us all and blocks my satisfaction
There’s a skyline in Oklahoma, stretches out over the corn
It can lead a horse to water, in the wake of the dawn
Catch a train from the desk in the office, give you more time to think
Ride it out to the bible belt, but hey man, will you drink?
I hear those California girls are mighty pretty
Shine like the bright lights over New York City
Oklahoma’s sunset has color but so does autumn in Central Park
But at least you know it’s safe to go walking after dark
I’ve decided I’d have to reach a happy medium
I’ll check off my list of points and what other people see in them
When I die they can read me the gospel
Put a eulogy on the internet if it’s possible
To tell the world I tried real hard to fufill a quota off a list
I recieved from the man from Minnesota
There’s a skyline in Oklahoma, stretches out over the corn
It can lead a horse to water, in the wake of the dawn
Catch a train from the desk in the office, give you more time to think
Ride it out to the bible belt, but hey man, will you drink?
There’s a skyline in Oklahoma

Yo.. I don't know what was on y'all niggaz birds(?)
to go up to the boat - and start robbin old folks
Now see you done messed with the wrong old lady
You done went wild; yo, check it..
There was a Hardy Boy mystery I tried to solve again
Dude that broke in my crib - it wasn't involvin him
Four in the mornin, my phone ringin
I'm thinkin, ""Who da fuck is this,"" on the other line screamin
Told em, ""Keep(?) down,"" but they was breathin hard
It was my grandmother tellin me that she had been robbed
I told her hold (hold) tight (tight), I'd be right over
Freezin but this situation made the night colder
Knew this was the night (that what?) that she played poker
with some friends in a club at the boat gettin bub'
Said she seen these thugs on the boat for a while (uhh)
Not gamblin but every now and then they'd smile
Then BLAOW! They had(?) Mag's
and told everybody, ""Put your shit in the bag""
Made people strip naked, quicker than a Luke record (what?)
Had the place took in a minute and some seconds
Asked her how many of it was em? (How many of it was em?)
Said she couldn't remember
She was spooked and buzzin, couldn't describe em
cause it happened too fast (what?) said they looked like me
with they pants hangin off they ass
Got her some water - and begin to think
How these niggaz take her wig, her bracelet and her mink?
Somebody round the crib know the deal (uhh)
Whoever did it better have Blue Shield for real
cause yo, it's the big payback..
{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}
[Common]
Later that day I went to the 'shop, to see what was up
Them niggaz probably knew somethin plus I needed a cut
Walked in they was playin Jigga (jihh-gga..)
Discussin how Da Brat titties done got bigger
These niggaz next to me, was talkin bout the heist
Whoever did it even got Jordan for his ice
Said that it was done so precise the cops ain't know nut-nin
Had to use all my might not to ask no questions
Put down the magazine, went to the pop machine
Noticin these cats, had the Bling Bling
They wouldn't be talkin if they did it; it could be they team
A week ago neither one of these niggaz had a ring
This Hype(?) came in, sellin CD's; said the BD's
was braggin bout robbery they had done
By now, I'm thinkin bout my gun if I see gramps bracelet
I'ma play racist (and what?) and make niggaz run
It's the big payback..
{*cuts n scratches*, Com ad-libs}
[Common]
My imagination roamed as I got in the chair
Thinkin - when shit went down, I was I was there
Fuckin with fam' - who you are, I don't care
Have your guys pourin liquor witch'ya name in they swear
These chicks claim they was there, knew the niggaz who done it
Said it was Smoke and them from the Wild 100's
Eight million stories got me runnin in place, it's gettin tricky
(like who?) like dude, that do drum'n'bass
There was a air in the place, that made me suspicious
Normally, they'd be talkin like bitches
My barber cut me with a quickness (what?)
Asked him where he got the new bracelet;
he said it was his sister's - I knew then
What made it official, he gave me my change
The money clip had gramp's initials (c'mon)
As I, whooped his ass up, six niggaz masked up
Pulled up in a Cadillac truck {*gunfire*}
[police scanner]
.. three-alarm fire ?? and a possible homicide
The building is entitled ""The Ultimate Barbershop""
There are six unidentified bodies in the building
They are all presumed dead
I repeat they are all presumed dead
However there are no suspects
I repeat the subjects are at large
we might need some backup..
Inform O'Malley that we need backup, over..
The skit definitely needs more ?? added to it
plus a new writer for the script, thank you..
Someone get Prince Paul on the phone please..

I revolve around the world, a problem solver
Alter your ego, and the way your walkin'
Talk to people, still I stay regal
Read through the bullshit
Sometime to make peace, you need a full clip
Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price
Talk shit, give good advice, rollin' through the 'hood right
It's the good life, like T.I. said
Gettin' it, how could I not be fed
Get bread, get dough, get fed, get mo'

Make 'em strip, like poker poker mag in his face
You tried to smoke my ace, you know the stakes

Leave you victimless, like Jack in ""Shining""
Blocked your bluff, now your respect is stolen
Took your chips, led my guys in Texas Hold 'Em
Rolled the strips of Vegas, with money boss players

Gangstas and hustles, living moviestar life
Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right

Song:   Pop's Rap III
[Pops]
Hey, hey old bean
And you to baby sweetness
Yeah, this is Pops, and I'm back in the studio
And I didn't have to break in this time
I'm back as a special guest by special request
And I want to thank my son for loaning me this microphone once again
They may have to wrassle to get it back
You know, as a result of my son Common touring the world
Pops has acquired a wonderful extended family
From around the globe
he has returned with positive messages to my earlobes
From all my children From Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Japan
And of course in the motherland
Even in the orient, they know what I meant
Nanaan, tanaan, tinaan, hanchinaan
So I didn't come in here to give any shouts out
I came to give praise and honor and to identify my children
Who've been saying and doing the right things
You know they sat on those nines of 1999
and kept them from turning upside down
And teaching the babies
to love, to be able to give love
And to enter the new century with their own prophecy
The century of amends
You see I deal with the premise that all children are ours
And that we all travel the same path
It's just that we don't get there at the same time
(See you next lifetime) See you next lifetime
And to my children running around here
talking about how nice is they ice
that they've already paid for twice
What karat is they gold
that was yours before you were done in the hole
Or that crew from 1629, buy some land
Think agriculture; beat that neighborhood
which you claim you love so dear
Are you mankind or what kind of a man?
See, Pops is straight out of the garden
from when the world was starting brand new,
Hip Hop, Hip Hop, the language of the underground railroad
In it's purest form
Yeah true hip hop is just like the Underground Railroad
If the message is not for you
It can sit on your nose and your brain remain froze
So when you see me traveling on a spiritual high
I'm flying high with Cee-Lo
Or maybe watching my long's heart dancing to a De La flow
Everybody knows there's no fruit on the tree with The Roots
And Black Star said we are what we are
The Knowledge Of Self Determination
And my little homie KG
Up there in Minnesota milking 10000 lakes
Keep the heat on em', we got to be kind to the growing mind
So if your heart is real
You will hear Big Will and Ms. Lauryn Hill
If your love is true, you will hear Badu-ism
And you can't go right until you go left
and get some ingredients from the music chef Jazzy Jeff
Children, I've traveled this globe
north to south, east to west
And whenever my soul appears lost
I turn to the musical stylings of a Tribe Called Quest
Okay, we ready to get out of here
We ready to take it home now
Just so everybody knows
When Pops get ready to say something good
I mean when it's time for me to lay it on the wood
And it ain't no time for no shecky shecky
That's when I turn to a Black Girl Named Betty
Y'all looking for the only truth and it doesn't even exist
I just come to give love and peace and honor to all my children

You see it's like no, pass it off, pass pass the puss
I ain't a nerd, but WE'VE GOT BUSH
So cut the bush brat, and let's move it like a U-Haul
Forget the grindin shit, I ain't tryin to get the blueball
Brrrrrrrrap bump me child, I'm speakin upon the nitty gritty
I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY
..
Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day
Unzip your zipper baby, and come my way
I'm Jack the Ripper, na-nah not Jack Tripper
Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker
So come one friend, come two friend, come all
United we stand, divide your legs so I can fall
in your bowl of cherries, Kerrie is so very
thick thicker than the Dick Tom and Harry
Tom and Jerry (WHAT?) A Woody Woodpecker
You need body work, I work that body, I'm a bodywrecker
Intersector, I'm the nectar plus the plum
I manage to take advantage, cause some of these hoes are so dumb
If you got some, just an eensy BIT of game
then it's safe to say it's that bet you can get a dame
I shoot, aim the same game, yo obedientally
Tell em that I get the drawers come off immediately
Here comes a nut slut, and we can do the Beat Street strut
and be that I'm a mutt -- so what?
No but if's or maybe baby, look who's talkin to
It's true when I'm drunk I might bone anything that's walkin
down the street, watchin ladies
Nobody's watchin you, because you got a baby
I ain't tryin to be a stepfather so I don't bother
Word to mommy dearest, I look farther
Down the road, to a road not taken
I'm tired of all these same bitches, I need to take care
a new flower, so Joe can take a shower
and get wet, and then jet
like ahhhh, seven-forty-seven
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear
""Is Common there?"" Uh-uh, sorry
you got the wrong number, if you wonder I'm the lumberjack
Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin back
It's like that and it'll be like that
Because a dog is a woman's best friend black

One two, one two, one two
Yo, I be the Big Illinois, here to build and destroy
I come on your deck, on your set
On your strip, through your burrough
Rippin any muthafucka that steps towards me
Yeah, I got power like floors be
Yo, check it out y'all
Real nigga quotes I tote, got some shit on the free but
This some shit that I wrote, legendary like the goat
Who got game?
Giving a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album, niggaz was expectin, now my water broke
Before it, I was sorta broke
Get the paper for the funnies, sports and the horoscope
On a curry goat, like flu stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short a rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'ma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown tryin to get home
Rarely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga, get gone
>From the wind storm, I've been told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw, don't talk to broads that are spoke for
That provokes war, stand out like cold sores
You claim that you hard but you wholecore
George Bush and CIA, you movin old or
Write like mention for publishin but you sold yours
chorus: Dug Infinite
Com got rhymes, Dug make beats
Style complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet
(on the real)You know the shit be real(x5)
(down on the real to real)
Common:
Chicka-chicka-M-chicka-C-chicka-M and my
People call me Com and collective with prospective
I draw crowds, go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like 'Nam sounds, tell yo bitch to calm down
Unless you want to get me skull askin me to take my hat off
On ill raps, I spit as if I had a bad cough
This Craig nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playin yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than an artery, jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony, it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy
Shit is real like a station property, crew is formin colonies
Commonly, I hear these rats thinkin they mahogany
On every rap hook, soundin like a dog to me
In a reservoir, I flow and go
On and on, like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion, hit makers get blown
(scratching)(on the real)
chorus: Dug Infinite
Common:
R and B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent, them niggaz whole style is silent
I hate to Staple the singers together, but in my head
It's been ringin forever...and a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
Where all you singers booty this and freak me baby, it gets me
MCs be insecure, like them little hoe niggaz Immature
Wearin bobs, if I got a show in your town, I'm there with mob
Bukein niggaz and pullin broads is the apparent job

Yeah, yeah, you know how me and 'Ye do
[Verse 1]
Real People walk in the streets, the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
Whatchu expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan, that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people
[Verse 2]
I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky, plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggaz hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people
[Verse 3]
Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface, a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye
I live across from it, some of it I do be in
I be showin' niggaz lives
Like UPN
It's real people
Yeah.
For you and yours
Good music
Forever
Yeah
Rock on
We keep on
Uh.. Yeah
Yeah, yeah
The real...

Uhh uh uh uhh yo yo yo
Check it, check it
Driftin on a memory, brought forth
from a fifth of Hennesey, as in times
of eighty-nine they envision me
Warm days and the cold beer chemistry
Eventually broken up by responsibilities and such
Sometimes this era mentally I reconstruct
High school I came out it
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America, me and my lady rock the same outfit
My niggaz be fuckin girls that she hang out with
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin over if he said,  Dumb bitch
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
Cool as a Mig Dry, that in the trunk shit
Afterparties in Wendy's parkin lot, unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Showin off for hoes in bricks and rows had us charged to box
That demo sorta stopped once A.C. got popped

Plugged with Gucci promotion so we got in free
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony, Ron'll be beatin
Saved my day, dancin on speakers
Flames snatched I was born this way
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin
Over gossip, Kenwood bras was pourin
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
and started coach out the back of Beauty Shop Sevalas
Buy the dope, put my name in they verse, EPMD
I would quote, stolen leathers I'd sell, like a child of broke
behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Shame on the girl that left her Fendi around crew
I'da go through it or, take it, we was bound to
Travellin like Vice Lords, down to the taste
Not wantin to bring my lady around crew cause they would snake
House parties was the lick, behind bars we'd come up
at em' I did the Hooper dance with my thumbs up

To get the break go, it go OOH OH

Nowadays niggaz is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
remindin me of the pointed parties Moe used to mace
Six deep in the Hyundai bumpin Twilight Tone tapes
Come home late callin broads hang up on they mother
If it wasn't nowhere to scrap at then we would fight each other
Get a room at the Dunes havin bakeouts
We'd eat, at Giadonno's and break out
Then everybody thought that they could spend
High rollers had the MCM blazer blend
Girbauds and Guess jeans we was takin in
Cranes and freight trains we was breakin in
Tim a be basin Mike down at I.I.T.
Rememberin numbers depended on how high I'd be
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill

Yeah I'ma get this one off for Eighty-Seven Street
South side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere check it
It's like c'mon y'all, get live get down
Common Sense is in your town
I said c'mon y'all, get live get down
Common sense is in your town
Verse One:
I stagger in the gathering possessed by a patter-in
That be scatterin
Over the globe will my vocals be travellin
Unravellin my abdomen it's slime that's babblin
Grammatics that are masculine
I grab them in, verbally badgerin broads
I wish that Madelline, was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hookin my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind or job or crib she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin a beer
Got more verses than a Kramer, go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the Bulls as much, they got too many white boys
A million black men walkin, towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection
Verse Two:
A prophet, raised among black disciples and Vice Lords
Who don't give a fuck about mic cords and nice swords
get up, together black risk your cup
I'm wishin for a change, my man want his change in a cup
Yessir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot
Bitches put em on the glass while I'm puttin stickers on they ass
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get smashed
In jams I M*A*S*H like Alan Alda
Niggaz nod, they say hey as if I was Little Walter
Eighty-Seven strip walker taught the code of the area
by staying, within the barrier
Exposed to stony stimuli, with that I identify
Brothers went through my rotate solidify the realness
Skull-caps, Murf Puffy jacket, Lug boots on
Steppin to me is like goin to the county being a Neutron
Verse Three:
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike
When in dim light
I use insight to enlight
Device up in da skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe
Imaginations in flight
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights
And in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like
I spend nights up in dykes
I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums
Hooked on negro and mums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggaz
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruisin Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
U Ak got my back and we don't get no thicker
Eighty-Seven got my back and we don't get no thicker
Chicago got my back and we don't now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga
Ain't scared of no nigga
But it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Yo, we gotta start respectin life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
Brothers gettin changed real quick over nothin
We losin too many of ours
Gotta recreate y'all
Yo, check it
Knowin you the best part of life, do I have the right to take yours
Cause I created you, irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin the act I was a part of
The start of somethin, I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree, a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone, I woulda fed this information I read
to someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin your first breath, first step, and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggaz with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on
I'ma use self control instead of birth control
Cause $315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth your soul
$315 ain't worth it
[Lauryn Hill (two layers of vocals, same words)]
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
[Common] Yo
Why didn't you stay
Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination
An intergration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin, more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe, havin this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better
Thinkin we all in love cause we can spend a day together
We talkin spendin the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers
but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our Parenthood to come from Planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin, findin myself in my God
So I can, discipline my son with my writin
Not have a judge tellin me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame
I had a book of Afrikan names, case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy
[Lauryn Hill]
I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
You said you would be here when it rained
Ohh I, never dreamed you'd leave in summer
Now the situation's made things change
Things change
Why, didn't you stay
Why didn't you stay...
I, never dreamed you'd leave, in summer
In summer
You said you would be here when, it rained
When it rained, it rained
Ohhhohh I, never dreamed, you'd leave in summer
You said you wouldn't leave
Now the situation's made things change
Things change, why didn't you stay?
Stay, stay stay stay stay stay stay
Mmmmm, stayyy

I'm going downtown like Julie Brown, I'm the round mound
Not a rebound, but like a hound, I get down down
Never wore a leash but I get loose
Producin somethin fresher than fruits, got more soul than combat boots
Diggin two scoops of raisins for the troops out of some blazers
so amazin like Luther everyday Joe but not Bazooka
I used to be a hooper but now I troop to shoot a free flow
Me go with mi amigo, to see the Man named Chico
The legal alienaeno, I roll the instrumentals
Like Jack I be like Nimble never gentle to a bimbo
Not your sex symbol so save that soft stuff for the Care Bears
The way I freak funk OHHHH the Monkees sayin, ""Hell yeah""
Correction, ""Hell yes""; old folks wanna cuss
on how I walk talk and dress, they say my life's a mess
But I'm straight, are you straight, if you straight, then I'm straight
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake
Back to our regularly scheduled program, program
I am so damn flam, I slam a slam, BAM, I slam
like Conan the Barbarian, if you talk loud, I'll play librarian
Cause see I want it quiet in here...
I Mark a Markyiana a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises
to stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors
I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers
""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog
(repeat 4X)
For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold
and reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male
and I can't tell, why for a hoe you grow a tail
and stop drinkin ale, the booty probably smell
Ain't no pussy worth a sale at least not for the kid to do a bid
Shit you musta flipped you lid, you was wit you slipped you slid
Got doodoo skids on my paper cause I got rhymes up the ass
If I pass gas, ducks fast or gets trimmed like a mustache
I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black
It's like McDonald's sellin fatback
Get back to your Mac, that stuff is wack with all these dancetracks
I'm hearin rap from Antrhax, my time the Caravan cracks
You're wack, that's the only thing that's black Scooter
When we was on the streets, you was at home on your computer
I'ma shoot a diss well like a fist to all these wack groups
Rhymes are wack as hell!  And they sample wack loops
I'm wonderin how the hell they get a deal I still can't see that far
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R
or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles
but you ain't G-in hip-hop, cause it's ours
""Gimme a pound, thank you man"" --> Tim Dog
(repeat 4X)
It's sick you sick I'm sicker, I flick a flea flicker
Think of thatI boa constrictor but the venom I inflicta
is stricter, I stick I stick the stinkin to a stunk
If soda was a forty dog, then I would be like drunk
If if was a fifth I would lift the fifth and a spliff
it's not a myth about our dick width, I'm swift and I shoot the presents
In essence count your blessings I got a Wessun if you riff
I'm a nigga with SOULLLLLLLLLL, my last name should be Smith-sonian
I'm gassin girls heads, just like petroleum
Get em ready to bone me and, then I play custodian
and turn off the lights this is the likes of a
ticketing wallowing high jumping radio rumping brother
Got Seoul like Korea gimme an inch I'll take a liter
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her
never go pop I'm not a two liter
A true leader, don't choose to follow, choose what I swallow
whether water or a beer bottle, of course I play the lotto
Wear em?  No, share em?  A hoe
I like the girls the girls I share a life with a bro
cause U-A-C is family, much tighter than foundations
that holds up the walls, so you better proceed with caution
""Gimme a pound, thank you man""
""Gimme a pound"" (4X)

Yeah, for the world!
Keep going so you can(yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going so you can (yo you can rock on)
We keep going
[Verse 1]
Nigga breath can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no mo' so off me you feed
I hustle at a speed between greed and need
On the streets where intuition and weed are breed
Shoot the gift and viff, at the myths uplift
My rhyme the clip its like the boom bip to tip(q)
In gangways where cats that rhyme the same way
Spending nites over Egypt to learn a brave day
Paint a picture of the ghetto like JJ
You the Ray J Of this rap world
I travel the globe with a black girl name Becky
Grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed the law cant arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt
Like Jesse Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See thru trying to out act Don Cheadle
I speak to original Hebrew s you know how we do
And bleed thru the needle with truth
That needs no preview to proof its in the people
And how they react still in the business of smacking
Rappers is wack you had a dope track I guess opposites
attract my mind state is black
Black like bernie mack no cowards soul power in the words we rap
[Verse 2]
Picks with fist, thick grease, dark nipples
My guy buy ice I search for the dark crystal
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I spit thru gang wars and strange doors
Out the sky flames pour the beats claims war
I see niggaz with flags who they waving them for?
I'm the nigga that you put the chain on the door for
The nigga that you started changing the laws for
Orator of hard-core and more
My raps the portal for the blue collar
Than made a hit and came up on a few dollars
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made dear mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
For truth your a decoy
Common Sense is like the future of the Bee-boy
I fall down and get up like Don McClerken
Hit puss and listen to it whistle while I'm trerkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war your stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanted to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own you see its like home grown herb black economics
The people we serve with Soul Power

Let's do it now, it's me and you
Close my eyes Erotica, I'm seein' you
Listen to me wishin' I could be with you
To share my love and ecstasy with you
Are you alone?  Is your shorty sleep?
Hold on.  That's okay, ignore the beep
For you, my love is immortal deep
You are my queen but I can't ignore the freak
Let's let our bodies talk and our auras speak
Hold on, gotta get the toiletries
As our waters reach distances unheard of
I'm in the room nestled sweet and I observe love
Only for you, I ask God to show me the truth
What he showed me was you
Wherever I go, my soul leads to you
Days gone, nights lonely for you
Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca - Wish on star 69
Erotica-ca-ca
Wish on star 69, erotica...
So much I wish you were here with me now
My bad, I just hit redial
I want you to come and never leave now
Is your mind and your right hand free now?
Our love-reach deep down inside of it
As the candle burns
where desire's lit
Makin' love knows no distance or environment
When we (ahh), feel the most high in it
I feel you touchin' me and I begin to rise from it
Your love is stuck in me
Our minds are so alive and thick
Picture my hands on your waist
As I stare in your face
Your mouth half open
Your love I can taste
Embracin' you
Life: I let go
Gotta switch phones 'cause this one is ghetto
Another level of love we create when we take it to
And when it's made, Erotica, it's made for you
Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine

Slave to your loneliness
""Slave to your loneliness...""
Inside of loneliness
""Inside this (alt we bear)""
With love of loneliness
""With thoughts of loneliness""
Enslaved by loneliness
I want you to come
Inside your mind
And find a place
Nasty and kind
This is where
our desires grind
And where they peak
Is most divine
A place and time
I hope we reach together
You are my queen
And freak forever
I feel you in-side my stomach
My body shakes...
Erotica - Wet dreams are on my mind
Erotica - Can I come in your mind?
Erotica - Oh yes, our love must shine

Whoever you are, whoever you are
Common:
Fuck waitin under my skin, the situation is scrapin
Somewhat like the girl X-ratin
It's hard to be patient with no VCR or PlayStation
Knowing your Rockports, somebody may be lacin
Make me wanna leave the city when I can't take a vacation
Without somebody breakin in my demonstration
For some South side information, I search the Nigga-net
It certain things about this I ain't figure yet
Dirt, the guy who stayed with me and had a set of keys
Because his job had been stopped smokin weed
Thursdays is off days, he usually watch his seed
For him to have done it, a babysitter and a car he would need
The stripper broad, my TV and couch, she couldn't carry it
Unless some nigga helped and that's who she'll get buried with
She was vegeterian and she wouldn't have cooked chicken
I confronted her with it, to her story, she was stickin
The plot thickens, as we drove in search of this hype
Who I ain't know by name, but I knew by bike
Chances of him breakin in, chillin and eatin
Are about as slim as he is
Though I knew where he lived
In his house with three kids, one I was cool with
As we roll, I told the guy, turn on the music
Just as I thought I closed in on one suspect
The nigga who did it popped the tape in the deck
(Excerpt from a movie)
Just tell me why. Don't lie to me man, just tell me why
It's the money, alright?
Just tell me why
It's the fuckin money, alright?

Reynoldo, shoot that piece of shit

Groove is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Toe cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a massouse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
When it's time for some action I get Red's ""Tonight's Da Night""
An eye for an eye, a life for his wife
Dissected I'm on some hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm with the fam and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit I'm the locksmith
Started a missionary way on my life, the mic I rust like bostage
I switch styles like a channel with controls that are remote
Engage in a page, and with words I elope
Walking down the aisles with styles I freak the viles
Anti-Nazi when I rocks like a Z-28
At any rate, brothers gain interest because I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
It's like that, coming from the go rapper
I wanna bone Jada Pinkett and that hoe Patra
So keep on, and you don't, now come on
Ah keep on, and you don't
Sometime when I'm alone in my room I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with the stolen card the credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me ""Never"", they be like ""Never's going to get it""
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!""
Other studs come through to see what I am up to
They be on the dick of crew that be giving us sweet and buying us fruit
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out because they look
Rest in peace to ?Heavena?, washing tons of rappers like Booker
Tee told me ""You gotta get out of the crib, get into the world""
How you going to come off with the style that's thourough?
It's like that, keep on, ha ha
It's like that, keep on
My foundation is in black block of niggas that rock they hat cock
I'm real like a fight with my rap, rappers I slapbox
Back I got my rap, now get your glock out the black face
Got tall flavor with fat taste, the rat race is a rat race
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before dinner I was getting big dog like Glen Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta get off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I write rhymes on the incline
Splat guts plus fat nuts and lay up like a crib line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son, come on

I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning
Ahhh, Common's comin with that old oh excuse me
Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a dewe-dewe
Doogie, Howser, cause see I'm like Bowser
Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt, and the
trousers, how's the, Family Ties?
I'm left with the gift, open it up, SUPRISE!
Big bat, filet-o-fish, quarter pounder french fries
Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaies and apple pies
And a cup?  Nah, that's enough of that
I'm like an indian giver, yo, give me that back
Comin again hip-pop-pop-pop bring it back selector
We be the thoroughbred, so use your head, play the Trifecta

Ya better duck cause muck-a-luck, it's me
[Now what's your name] Common
Come in again... Common
[How would you do it] Common
[Now how was she] Common, check it out!
Common is coming soon to a theater near you
To the U-A-C crew, nuff respect due
Do I do, where I do, when I do
I do do do, yo I do it on the ease
Verse Two:
I be kickin it with the doubly-dope rhymer
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sli-mer
[Who ya gonna call?] Ghostbuster
I'm pee-wee we stole, and I'm just a
Hustler, I tried to scheme for a sec
But the record got wreck, tried to write a bad check
So I checked myself, before self got buck
wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a snake, and metriculate, yo I had to elevate
You can tell it's great, cause I'm state
of 87, the South side of Chicago
Five-oh-one come follow me yo, everywhere that I go
And I know I ain't did nuthin [hell naw]
The district think I be just a lil trick kid frontin
U Ak got my back if there's any contact
In the back is a track from Immenslope soul cat
And it's phat, sorta like Oprah before she lost weight
I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State
And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia
Holy-molia, it's totally awesome
The survey say, I gets moe skins than Richard Dawson
But I won't catch mono or no type of disease
Cause when I flex, for sex, I do it on the ease
Verse Three:
A lop bop a woo bop, a lop bam boogie
I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper
two-steppin through, yodel-le-hee-hoo!
Oui oui mon cheri, a como tale vouz?
[Contraire mon frere] OK, to the death
Is it true that I'm dope? {Yeahhhh!}
Yippedy yes y'all, here we go a loopedy loop de loo
A hubbeda hula hoop, a hubbeda alley oop to Coop
I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker
I'm shakin-and-bakin-and-takin, cause I'm the back-board
break her arm and feather, whippin the wonder when she activates
Hold up!  My jaws are in my crack, [aight] pass the tape
Time to activate, and ejaculate
This is the beauty of where I'm in a state
I meant to say demonstrate
I'm in a state, where I've had too much eight, ball
In the corner pocket, count em, buck it
A chicken, a finger-lickin with a finger-bone
C'mon I'm on a roll, stippedy stutter-roll
Owah-owah-owah-owah Ayatoll
of Khomein, my domain is infinite
Ya got trouble, well you need to get some dick
and to the hip-hop shop, the future shock

You know I ain't the type to play killa
But this day still arrives in my mind like a flight on down
Thursday night had plans to be out
Till the night served daylight
But it ain't happen
Rappin' to myself cause there wasn't noone to rap to
This feeling came to me like somebody lookin' at you
There was these cats who me and my crew boxed against
Gotta - spotted the glock now the nigga's got some confidence
Cause I'm Common Sense and I rap consciousness
He was prop to dis mad cause my guy used to knock his bitch
I could sense he was tryin' to bring it
But I wasn't ready to receive it
In fact I made him leave it
Before he could achieve it
As we rolled through the streets of cottage grove
And reach the stoplight
Behind me, he flashed lights bright, sorta cop-like
I'm thinkin' Tupac-like cause he got out the car
I was taught only to fight in defense or the in will of Allah
And ain't no talking when it's time to spar
So before he popped some shit I did ??I act my shit is solo??
Back his lady trying to hold him like big pun
I stowed 'em and told 'em
I ain't'a shoot I just punch a lot
Between blows this nig' tried to up his glock
His brother watched spooked like a daddy on teenage love
He got 'buked til my tape I got sing like a dove
Got his dome into her
My fist brought back the one hand
Tried to pop it musta been a nine cause the gun jammed
Unplanned I disarm this trick nigga
Pistol-whipped his ass, his lady's I was palmin' it
Hollered '87 reign dominant
Needed a fight that night
Me and my woman had a argument
""I guess I should tell you a little something about myself""
""I bang with the big boys, those who obey""

Hey now why you gotta hold yo' thang?
Scared to shoot, scared to shoot

The revolution is here
Yeah, it's Common Sense, with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music, from the soul, y'all
Yeah, check it, yo
The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard, a king with words
Can't knock the hustle, but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured
Some say I'm too deep, I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me, Muhammed will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
with cigarettes in their ear, niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru, that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack, forgot that
Chorus: (Scratched by DJ Premier with variations):
""This is rap for real, something you feel""
""And you know, yes you know""
""Rap for the black people""
""Heeeeyyyy, heeeeeyyyy""
In front of two-inch glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write, I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth, across the table from corporate lies
Immortilized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music, you either fight, fuck, or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme, I try to scheme through it
Through my shell, never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved, I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix, exposing fake shit
Chorus
Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at 87th, stopped by this little girl
She recited raps, I forgot where they was from
In 'em, she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking, how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective?
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it, I ain't relating
If I don't like it, I don't like it, that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes, it's like
Chorus til fade

Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose, talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke, and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows, the wind is cold and it blows
In they socks and they soles, niggaz holdin' they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed, hopin' for mo'
We know where to go, niggaz rollin' in droves
They shoot the wrong way, cuz they ain't know and they goes
The streets ain't safe cuz they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told, either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows, hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds, with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold, the block is hot as a stove
On the corners

And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: Lost Prophets)
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins and
Yellow and pink and
? profiles ??
Verse 2: (Common)
Street lights and deep nights, cats tryin' to eat right
Ridin' no-seat-bikes, with work to feed hypes
So they can get sweet Nike's, they head and they feet right
Desires of street life, cars and weed types
Its hard to breathe nights, days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets, the police is Greek-like
Game that is deep, we speak and believe hype
Banged in the streets has cop left for deep life (?)
Its steep life, coming up where niggaz is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers, we strive to be like
G's with three strikes, seeds that need light
Cheese and recite, needs and BE strife
The corner, where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong cuz its hard to see right
Look to the sky, hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch, and I heard that she bites
The corner
Hook:
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggaz rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: Lost Prophets)
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
Verse 3: (Common)
Black church services, murderers, Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents, move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile, its people workin' and earnin' this
The curb getters go where the cats flow and the current is
Its so hot that niggaz burn to live
The furnace is, whether money movin', the determined live
We talk shit, play lotto, and buy German beers
Its so black packed with action that's affirmative
The corners
Hook:
(Kanye West)
I wish I could give you this feelin'
I wish I could give this feelin'
On the corners niggaz rob or kill
And dyin' just to make a livin', huh?
(Spoken: Lost Prophets)
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner

And I guess I bought it, the first time I saw it.
Do you know the air? In and out like the coffeepot?
My hands worn far from fair, are in no shape to touch your heart.
So please, leave me here, here amidst the breath of strangers
One could say that words are never clear
Maybe they’re only meant for our mouths to savor
These roads lead me there, break the clutch with a touch so kind
Flashing hazards where, I’ve decided to park my mind
So please, leave me here, here amidst the breath of strangers
One could say that words are never clear
Maybe they’re only meant for our mouths to savor

Tonight's musical guest
Two of Chicago's Finest emcees!
Give it up for Common and Kanye West!
""It's Common Sense!""
[Intro - Common]
Yeah! ""Common Sense!"" - [scratched]
It's Common Sense! With Kanye West!
On the Dave Chappelle Show!
Everybody gotta eat right?
It's the food baby!
[Chorus - Kanye West]
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late (uh oh! uh oh! uh oh!)
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
[Verse - Common]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin, in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle, titties and skin, fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in em
Felt the southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide wit em, a system that tries victims
We living in, my man in the fast lane pivoting
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it ""Jump Off"" like Kim and them
On the block it's hot, you can feel it, in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assembling
Eyes bright, it seems like the fight is dimming them
Call my man cuzo, like I'm kin to him
He trying to stay straight, the streets is bending him
[Chorus]
[Verse - Common]
It's all good in the hood, like raps and gems
Throwbacks and Timbs, blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts, attires of all sorts
We never fall short, wit us it's Our Force like And 1's
Some waves, some air guns, the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below, wit self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the doe
Though I know to grow a - gotta learn to let go
Though I know the doe I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on Terot cards pointing to the grind
Po' livin in more prisons, pointing to my mind, shine the light up
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations, and jobs get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up, c'mon!
[Chorus]
[Bridge - Kanye West]
I - I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me
I - no I can't let it ride
No no not tonight
See I can't run away or put my - away
You can't front on me

[Chorus:]
It's only right that I address this.
Gotta be in it to win it.
I never come lame type chillin in the game.
Now get busy
[Verse 1:]
Raised by game
Where niggas ain't fazed by fame.
Come to the crib, get banged, they take your chain.
Stay in your lane
Broke back ain't the way of the game.
My brainstorm is like I stay in the ring.
My favorite was Kane, now I'm dope with weight in the game
You was hot but can't stay in the rain.
Ghetto pain and windows crack.
The fist is like a symbol for black
Can tell the real by how the interact
In the middle of whack my soul stick to a track
Kickback records get kicked to the back
I want big cribs and my man Ronnie to get his
Child in a good school and know what her gift is
It's global warming, the world is shifting
Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bithin-ass rich kids
You know, I know I gotta go the distance
Whether yoga or doja, we all get lifted in the game.
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
I never kissed that ass of the masters
I'm the black molasses
Thick and I last
Pass these rat bastards
They try to box me in like gaseous clay
Hey I'm like Muhammad when he fasted
Opposing the fascist
Got cuts and got gashes, scratches over third eyelashes
Punchlines are like jab pits to rappers
Whose careers now ashes
It's too many slashes in their name
Came in the game
From weak lines to clothing lines to an actress
I seen em dashing smash hits
I yell run nigga run
While I cook up classics
The weak hearted, become Babylon puppets
Making it hard for real hustlas
Touch the sky now and then, with a lady friend
Give thanks to the most that's how the day begins in the game.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3:]
I just wanna be like Akeelah, an achiever
from the streets of the Chi where some get high for leisure
Selling weed out of cleaners
From rocks to barber shops and beamers
Chicks with blond weaves and strong legs like Serena
The demeanor of the Ghetto, to never stay settled
Aldermen and corrupt men play Pharaoh
Good bring business to the hood like heralds
Find your own, walking by themselves in the street
The young die of cancer
I stopped eating meat
Greet the gods on 87th street like peace
Even though it's , got em facing the east
The game ain't tasting as sweet
Cats flow is still, and his compliance with beats
My radio station is deep , so eff em
Progression, counting paper and blessings in the game

[Common]
My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard, hard times we embrace
Everybody want a yard, cuz a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
The hustle is hollarin'
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollarin'
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to prophet like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
They get it from they momma, black music is fatherin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
Tell your guy and them, yo the blocks hot again
Aunties walking to liquor stores in moccasains
My guy got a gig, on the side he barberin'
Married a foreign chick so she could get a green card up in the hustle
[Chorus]
[Common] Just put it in your back and hustle
The paper's stacked so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that

It's on your mind so hustle
[Omar] Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
Gon'! - Gon' get it and get me that
[Dart Chillz]
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Heard is a verb when you pour dirt on the floor
Bill collecters and the roaches working your nerves
It's a ghetto truck for a ghetto boy
To get in them ghetto streets and get him a ghetto toys
So he can come so just work murder rate is increasin'
I don't give a fuck long as my coke is decent
And my rims blind the whole damn precinct
Everytime you see a head in my lap you know she sinked
I know I'm dead in this trap, that's not how we think
Fifty shells all around on the ground, can't catch a weak blink
Five went through me, two stayed in me to do my duty
Only thing that subdued me
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1's new sneaks

I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault em cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggaz recognize the light but they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I wanna be the one to make you happiest, it hurts you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close..
.. to the most, high
Regardless of what happen on him let's rely
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..
Yo, yo, check it
It's important, we communicate
and tune the fate of this union, to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
from an East Coast shine night's moon, you my light
If heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray everyday more than anything
friends will stay as we begin to lay
this foundation for a family - love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth having you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side, oh darling
There is a light, that shines,
special for you, and me..
Yeah.. yo, yo, check it
It's kinda fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
and I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you ship hop when it's time to, thinkin you fresh
Suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you, but as my equal
it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right, I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you, peace
There are times.. when you'll need someone..
I will be by your side..
There is a light, that shines,

Ridin in they regal, tryin to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo, I found the new primo
Yeah you know how we do, we do it for the people
And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope, experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes, the rougher I wrote, times were harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end tryin to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce, its all our culture
Everyday we hustlin, tryna get them custom rims
Law we ain't trustin them, thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of bunchin it, I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling, I think how I'm touchin them

Got back stage, and I bumped into Stevie

Hunger in they eyes, is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me

"286","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/common/the_remedy-lyrics-577846.html","common","The Remedy ","Yo, we all got different things we got to deal with. We always are trying
to put the blame on something else rather than sometimes looking at
ourselves, recognizing a lot of the stuff that happens...but if we look
within ourselves, we could prevent a lot of this nonsense. It's about
relating back to the essence, where it all stems from. I'm-a do my thing
over this drum, like a native tongue.
Verse one
Q-Tip:
Do what you will, if you feel that your steeze is real
complicated with the skills over reel to reel
brown skin is what i feel, my mind and body's appeal
is to the no-frill mills, who hear the beats to chill
constantly, I'm hearing Black Americans just sneering
Looking for a leader who can fill us up with either
Hitting us up with great emotional chat
about the fact
that the black
is constantly held back
Like 50 tracks back in a relay race
and the white team's ahead
so let's keep up the pace
And I be needing something
To feed my logical taste
At the end of the race is there a paradise place?
Yo, we can't get involved in what the next man is doing
Material gain we put too much in persuing
""Yo duke, I need this dough so we can step to this party""
But we can all mardi grati
Minus that shit in our body
""What that got to do with that""
'Cause kid that's the essence,
your physical presence
embodies every lesson
You can't run the Rolls Royce if the engine is busted.
Can't even life the knife to cut the mustard.
What we need to do first
Now listen to this verse
Let's concentrate on our spiritual plate.
Recognize your existence in this vast blue space
From a tiny cloud of blood
To the human beings with taste, sight, touch, smell
and sound
Let's deem it profound!
And prioritize this cause it was Allah's wish
""Allah? I'm God""
""No I ddon't believe that. That's a mystery""
""If God is so good why does shit be happening to me?""
There's divinity within
because we come from the divine
A froce that's not seen But you feel it every time
When the wind blows, and the world turns,
and the rain drops, and the baby cries
and the bird flies, and the ground quake,
and the stars gleam
So many things are eident of its existence
What we need to do is link it with persistence
Once we recognize that, we can move ahead
Native Tongue, Common Sense yo he's Hip-Hop bred...
Common:
From the spiritual world my former life has developed
First person I lost close to me was Stella
Some of my mellows
Lost their mothers and their brothers
For them I feel empathy
But I ain't pouring out no liquor for no niggas
I pour my heart out when I see Dot out on the deck
Knowing two weeks ago he slapped-box with death
I hear of niggas dying in the wind-in the news
But when it's somebody you know it hits you
and emotions get bruised
I ain't been in your shoes,
I won't judge you for knocking
Because the spirit of the ghetto says ""You Gotta!""
They snatch you again from rock flippin'
Give back into the neighborhood, you better start kickin'
Stickin' stores
On the strip
I'm tired of Arabs giving me my change back
Devil bomb my yesterday
My tomorrow he never gave back
I lay back, looking at the ceiling
Wonndering what can I do
So my homie won't have to be dealing
Not cause you serving and I'm rapping I'm better
Just different pieces to the puzzle of black life
That we have to put together, better ourselves
cause families we gotta raise
No matter how long the money
Shorter become the days
Men become like women
and no difference in the season
If you got popped five times
You breathing for a reason
Let's put the five tenure plan into progression
Before we count our paper
Count our blessings

Ha, yeah, yeah, play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it
You know it, these minimes try to clone us
I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas livin on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it aint aight wit me
Right, gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fuckin bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talkin 'bout
Yup, stay turnin these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw somethin down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down south
All the way to London to my nigga Common house
Right, it's like a game we never play out, out, out, out...
Nigga no doubt, nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up, just be about what you about dogg
Knowhatimsayin, just play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
You know us, this rap shit we 'bout to own it
You know it, cuz you can feel it in your throat
Say it
I'm 'bout to let my mind float
(Com, say it)
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope...
Ness, a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap shit, no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I, feel it in her breasts
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this, box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in wild style
Invitin wack niggas to dinner
I ""Trick Daddy"" emcees and I don't know, ""Nann Nigga""
Who can take it where I take it
You better go into God like Mase did
Leavin crowds complacent
I move em above clouds whether on some ?surface the earth? shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want no one to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy, niggas tryin to clone us
You know us, Thelonious, super microphone
You know this, rap shit we 'bout to own it dun, for real
Ay, it's like a ritual
You been invited let the ?? stimulate the place
With the grace, nevertheless, I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual, when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for ???????
Hurtin like a ?? in that ass, like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why, you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word, cuz it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind, and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Darken the line and your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth, yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art, never go astray
Word is bond
Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it, it's Thelonious
Ownin this rap shit, super microphonist, and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkiss
You want this, so MJ kept sayin the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, ""Off The Wall"" wit mines
I'm grabbin my balls when I rhyme, nine nines bustin plus
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You aint on my mind I'm thinkin 'bout paychecks
Niggas large like an Adex Avirex jacket
Yo the gods they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is somethin like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny doo, cuz really you think you can do me
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas, if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a pay back

They say ""What's happenin'?""
We say the facts and if, they lie...
We comin' back for them
They might say... but they don't know!
(They say, They say...)
They don't knowwwww
[Verse 1: Common]
They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix, the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
I be tellin Derick, ""Tell Kara get us a show""
Little Com, I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man aint necessarily the nigga wit dough
They say ""You ripped"" ""Wow..."" Yea, that's what they say
My niggaz couldn't tell it was me, like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day, wit focused crime, broads, and good wine
They say ""Dope is sour so it's homework and hood crimes""
I stood mine, for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say - tell 'em, J
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ahh... The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breath it in like antihistamine
I know they sayin ""Damn, Yay snapped wit this beat!""
Fuck you expect? I've got a history
Groupie love now, gotta be them wheels!
Haters back down, gotta be that steel!
I know they cant wait till ya outta ya deal!
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel!
My best friends worry bout me
Cause they know when you famous/fame-ass
And you had made cash the media aims at us and you be up so high
if you ever fall off, it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I cant handle
So please don't ever give me records I cant sample
So I could vacate where it aint no channels
but it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just gon check myself in - again
(Chorus) Kanye West: ""Uh!"" [hey!]
[Verse 3: Common]
They say ""Dude think he righteous""
I write just to free minds, from Stoney to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless, in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper, whether its weed or Isis
They say ""life is a game,"" so I play hard
Writin for my life cause I'm scared of a day job
They say ""Sef kept the hood together""
I tell the young, ""We can't play the hood forever""
Play my cards right, they say I went to left
They showed me strange love, like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of, pawns and knights
Now I claim ""King"" like Don, or Frank White
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed, and resurrected, twice
They say ""The crochet pants and the sweater was wack""
Seen ""The Corner"", now they say ""That nigga's back,"" uh...
[Chorus]

Check it out
Good morning... be at calm, I'm back
HUH! It's me again
Is it me you're looking for? (Yup)
For the perfect beat, sweetly oblique
I'm fresh, I come clean, but I can't whistle
*attempt at whistling* Psss, I'm only buggin
While No dug in the crates, I dug in my nose
and picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time
to waste, I'm hip... don't even trip
to an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free, you want some flyer to read
then buy from me
I got the flame like U-I-C but I be, U-A-C
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
in your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me (why?) because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me, I'm gonna bust dickses
not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
down to the preps in the Polos, the studs with pros
hoes who wheeze, the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters, high rollers and rollers
Players with plat studs with stocking caps I be rocking raps
til I collapse
Niggaz play my tape about as much as they do craps
I'm on point, I celo, I see high
Hi C, I'm free at last
I'ma free man, free as the world be
and like an early bird, I'm special
But you ain't that special, as that investor
So to myself I say congratulations
I'm glad you had the patience, you better have the patience
Cause thisisme

Whassup Scony Rony I'm that boney homey
from Stoney (Common) you know me!
Off the GP niggaz see me on the TV
Talkin Take It EZ, and they was like ""He ain't hardcore!""
But hardcore is far more than bats and gats
It stems back to the roots of being true
It's gonna get me Me, you just get you You
What I look like, talkin about some shit I ain't do?
I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody
I ain't kill nobody, it wasn't us it was THEM!
The Warriors, I'm a warrior and still don't have to show no gun
It takes one to know one, and no one can tell me
how to be, cause I'ma be me, aight?
Cause I'm a man, now check it
""I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me"" --> KRS-One

(repeat 3X)
*singing* Sometimes, sometimes, I get a good feeling!
When I'm chillin at the flat, lookin at the wall
Wondering can I come off of it, I'm off a bit
on the mic I be talkin shit
But some say my talk don't make no Sense
I'm tryin to make the Dollars, my momma told me
to go to school and be a scholar, but school ain't for me
So don't even go there, I'm comin out of nowhere, to go where
probably in about seven years, I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President, I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee, I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark/arc, on the shot
but now when I shoot rock, I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South, and fell in love call me love
cause love is gonna getcha I'ma getcha
I'm like B.J. my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya
Styles from East to West, all across the country
I'm like that big fat one niggaz catch when bumpin
I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster
But I am a gangsta, call me the gangsta of love!!!
I love good music, I love my momma
I love myself, I love you, and you love me
And thisis -- I'm out

Yo I wanna say peace to my moms, my grandmomma

What what, we do this time
Rock rock....
Yes, let this music travel through you
Talk about feelings, yeah yo
Yo wassup world
Yo what's happening
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been, time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*
Yo, I was a piano player in my last lifetime
Now I write rhymes, sip white wine and let my light shine
Out the dark space, with the world on my mind like Scarface
though my sex drive like a car chase
More than a uhh, it's the piece of mind I chase
Stakes are high, like my uncle is
We both got problems, he never confronted his
Under the bridge I wrote, some shit to stay afloat
And paint a picture, raw like the first coat
Send my old man a note to keep his phone on
My little cuz'll know cheap tricks are homegrown
Travel to a place sweeter than home, listenin to Nina Simone
Repeat this psalm, to the sky I'm keepin my palms
Facin the east, actions macin the beast
Embracin the streets, my god caught a case cuz he beat
His lady down, it's two-thou
That ain't the way we lay it down
Souls get, found and lost at the roads they cross
Many paid dues, but few knew the costs
I ran through the Moss like Randy
Touchindown wit God, close friends, and family
Recognize the voice in the wilderness
Com Sense, '92 and I'm still in this
Time travelin, took my time in hand
My rhyme learn and plan
Jealousy, money and pride can burn a man
Some walk but never learn to stand
Still, afraid to expand what they feel
I'm dealin wit, wakes, marriages
ATM's, Ericsson's
Loud niggas that whisper carelessness
If we livin in Revelation
Why should the people of the sun have to run
Come to Esau in a year, he'll have freedom
He ask why I hadn't been to see him
Really, I ain't have a good reason
He said,  Rah, give back what you receivin
In a race against time, I was caught
In the same game as you, but long live the sport
It's time travelin
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend
Spaces and places you been
Time travelin *fades out* time travelin....
Time travelin *echoes*
Time travelin *echoes*
Yeah, yo wassup world, yo what's happening
It's the C-double-O and I'm back again
Take this back and then, tell a friend

Hyper when I venilate
My rap pieces penetate and infiltrate your mental state
Just to reitterate
That I innovate
Bonin' broads when they men-estruate
I speand a great time with the rhyme
More than I did any female
I derailed your train of thought
Because your brain was caught
On some other man's thinking
Now your third eye is blinking
My rhymes be kicking like a brother's breath be stinking
I get funky for sure while you're *sniff* unsure
If you got beef, chief, then let that shit unthaw
This track was a broad
I'd be bonin the shit out of it
Bang, bang, bang then see what I can get out of her
probably some scratch clothes and some J's
I got six thousand ways to rhyme
Choose one
I stand out like a nigga on a hockey team
I got goals, and I can like a pop machine
I come clean
Like a fiend in Chi I'm down with rehab
My stutter styles crazy
Cause that's right, we bad, we bad
Pryor to Richard I was that crazy nigga
Cause I kick ass
And when i wreck other rappers be like whiplash!
Verse Two:
It's like I come I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the gils want to dance
It's like I come I come to the party in a b-boy stance
I rock on the mic and make the gils want to dance
Me without a lyric, is like a nigga without a beeper
I'm a blow this shit out, cuz I'm the joint like reefer
If Barry White was in the mob
I still would be deeper
Cause i had lyrics back when i used to run with Keyvin
MC's step to me, butt-ass naked like ""What's up?""
I said, ""You know you done fucked up
Now I'm sayin, ""You know you done fucked up""
Everybody that here be say I'm Jams like the NBA
Cause I'm on fire
If I was a Michelan I wouldn't tire
It's funny how time flies
Well I'm as fly as time
I don't believe in role models
But if I do, then I'm mine
I make brothers say ""True""
They be you and be like fiction
I want 'spect and dead presidents
Like Richard Nixon
I'm a coach not a player
Not a gay mc, I'm straighter
My style is similiar to AIDS
You can f with it now
But catch you later
You can't touch this, cuz this is what I'm feelin bro
I'm the man, you need me I'll be on the fifth flo'
Just chillin
Even if it's played out it's not the word to play so peace
I'm out to Dirty Burgers I'ma give my change to Reese

And I won't stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning our
So walk keep climbing won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, ""Aye boy just go school""
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning our
So walk keep climbing won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
Now his whole life he told his boys, ""Hey yall I'm going to rap""
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back
Now his mama she would say to him. ""You need to get get back in school""
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using it for fuel
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning our
So walk keep climbing won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
And the story goes on and on it goes on and on and on
They say, "" Hey boy you rap real good, but ain't making no good songs""
So he 'd tell him self yo yo yo self you gotta do it the way you do
And make this musing from your soul and make it fresh and new
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?
S**t that make the world all work that's what in my blood
And I won't stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning our
So walk keep climbing won't look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world
Then the fame it started to change, They say music just ain't the same
Though he remained the song he is sang keep your drive stay in your lane
Inch by inch people ccame the started to know his name and say you do your thang
Now the whole whole world singing his song from Chicago a star it born
What do you see when look at me and I'm just standing there?

He's got an answer for everything
You can see the movie that's about
But you can't really talk until you've been
See them all coming up for air
We're oh so tired with something to show
Recognize her footstep sound on the stairs
Listen up high but talk low
A car in every front lawn
More time in every clock
A girl in every doorway
A bar on every block
What we have now...
I'll find the chord to ignore
And a reason outside the gate
Won't do these chores no more
Dinner shifts and coffee breaks
How these ticks of desperation
Turn to looks of sophistication
How that ""do or die"" front nose
Turns to strands of her wedding clothes
A car on every front lawn
More time in every clock
A girl in every doorway
A bar on every block
What we have now...
The absence of what is wrong
Doesn't something good make
If you're not leaving for too long
We could something good take
Because the presence of what is right
Helps to shape the baby's bite
But if you leave me on a train
You could render me the same
A ring in every church bell
More time in every clock
A train at every station
And a drink at every stop
What we have now...

[Talib]
Ok, its the emcee extraordinaire Talib Kweli
Chillin on Soundbombing 3, with my peoples
From the East, Cypha Soundz, from West, Mr. Choc
This is how we do it, I got y'all back, y'all got mine
Let's do this- no more music motherfuckers
[laughing]
[Zap Mama- Chorus]
Yelling, yelling, yelling away
Going, going, going away
And fly, away
[Talib]
Yo, fly in it
Blue skies the limit, the skies infinite
It reflect in the eyes of those who try to send spies in it
Capture the sun if they could, but they go blind by it
Look in the sky and I see Africa's eyes in it
The land is dry like the cry in'finite
The tear we shed grow to fruit til the eye replenish
The industry wanna try to give my rhyme a sentence
Behind bars with my rhymes diminished, they tryna end us
But all them clowns do is give my mind a senate
To watch my people's enemy die in my presence
Fly away on the highest adventure out on the line
And enter the gate of Zion, need to decide who sent em'
I went through the jungle (yeah)
Stalking like a black panther, rap's answer to that cancer
Choking the life out the hood
They won't let a man emancipate his people
This refreshing like the spray of the bay in Puerto Rico
[Chorus] x2
[Zap Mama]
All the things, you desire
Earth...wind...water, fire
These elements hammer nice together
See, you can find it there
Find it there
[Chorus] x2
[Common]
Yo, I came into this world as the naked truth
A little baby girl, trying to make it through
Through this earth, wind, fire and water
That I'm someone's daughter
Cadence of divine order
Sorta sent to let the people know their times spent
It's precious and we can't keep our minds bent
On just the pleasures of sex, drugs, wine, bread
In essence, we one with the environment
Though I've been here, less than a year
Being so close to god, I guess I haven't learned the fear
When I heard nature telling me, time to come home
Told my mind this is the path for you to walk, not to run on
Understand the night, to reach a higher day
Follow yourself so you can fly away (fly away)
Fly away dawg, fly away dawg, fly away dawg, fly away dawg
[Zap Mama]
You are feeling, the stress
But in life, you're truly blessed
Go...for...nothing less
Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away
[Chorus] x4

Go...for...nothing less (x3)

Say she like me cause my rims real tall
If you want work bitch you can call us

Ridin through the hood throwin money out the brain
and I'm lookin for the girls wit the booty shorts mane

Candy Escalade 26 inch blades
Throw back money from back in eighth grade
Ya dancin in the club so I know ya get paid

Girls in the club like dat there stank
Showin off three or four rubberband banks
Me and HB keep a big bankroll pulled up in a Hemi wit the Lambo Doors
Me and yo chick in a red corvette
I neva had shit nigga what ya expect
Neva seen a young man paint so wet hood rich and my album ain't even dropped yet
You'll neva see a man wit a watch like mine
Face real pretty and a body real fine
When we get home I'm a break her spine
Get in her ear and corrupt her mind

Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I'm the same lil' nigga that taught your brother to smoke
But now-a-days man I stay on the news
My every move is up on the tube
Whoever said bein a gangsta was easy
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy
To be a gangsta is a full time job
A bad a boy but I aint [unsure]
The pays good but the hours are crazy
You disrespect me I'ma see ya degraded
I'm never scared but I'm thinkin ahead
because they don't bury the scared man they bury the dead

Gucci Mane make you look like you posed to look

Let you party like a rock star, ride in a boxcar
Have you gainin weight everyday eatin lobster
All you friends invited so you can bring a partner
Gucci in the hood sellin weed like a doctor
Fifty dollar slab to a trunk full of holes
Never at the house cause I'm always doing shows
Teamed up wit big cat now they want to chit chat
Role to crash road, flat shoals represent that
Gucci in the booth and my flows crazy
Is it hot in here nigga or it's just me
Have you at south beach falling of Jet Ski
Smokin purple weed under shade of palm trees
In Biloxi we could spend a hundred gees

Married to the game me and ????? live together
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher

I'm my best friend
and I'm my worst enemy
and no one else can hurt me unless I let them
is you feelin me
and misery loves company and I had my share of misery
no mystery my infamy got me in hip hop history
First Tupac died then Biggie died
and that greatly impacted me
then history repeated itself through me and I make history
(its Gucci)
so I dont turn around no more
I look at whats in front of me
I'm focused on the future cos yesterday is history
A hard head makes a soft ass
guess yo mom didnt teach ya that
pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet ya at
but let me check my schedule
Im free Tuesday 3 weeks from now
you bring your crew I bring my crew
just pick a time and side of town
zone 6 is my stomping ground
but I guess you know that by now
but everywhere you go you hear me
thats why your upset right now
bought a Phantom and a Lamb
but Im in my vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber
bank account are pregnant now
the day they tried to murder me a day I cant forget about
and I dont wish no death on homie
just want him to hear me out
think about the past and all the many things we talked about
think about all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth
Chorus
I am not the perfect person
me dont spit the perfect verses
I wouldnt hurt a girl on purpose cos I feel they dont deserve it
I admit my words can hurt
I dissed tiny she didnt deserve it
our song didnt interpret it right and Im sorry for it
T.I. many times encouraged
told me face the game with courage
clay me some great advice and still today I thankful for it
Me Jeezy and T.I. share one thing in common all are poets
role model to young people tho at times man we still ignore it
and yall gon owe respect to me and I dont like apologies
just diss me till you satisfied
i swear it doesnt bother me
sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets
wont reflect off me but words and insults only show the World how yall respectin me
Chorus
All my homies aint my homies
hell my friends no longer want me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
things I got I know they want it
things I done they havent done it
tho they say that they my friends
I know that these n-ggas opponent
we can joke and laugh and party
but I know their smiles are phoney
but I still pray that the Lord give em all the things they wanted
all the money in the World cant get the joy Im felling homie
like the third date with a woman like you and not for your money
you can help someone and love someone but still they turn and burn you
so i warn you in advance watch out cos so called friends will con you
Think MJG said it best ""when will I ever know?"" who my friends through thick and thin cos so called friends will turn to foes.
through thick and thin cos so called friends will turn to foes.

Which means that I'm pordo, which means that I'm gordo
Which means that I use a G4, like in auto
I'm a walkin' memorial
I'm legendary for whippin' whippin' that boss
So nigga just let that cause go
[Hook with ad-libs]
[Bridge]
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Hey, let's go
Snowman bitch, I don't even wear the same draws
Flat screens on my walls, flows look like bowling balls
I know Big Meeks, the real Big Meeks
It's over for you clowns soon as my nigga hit them streets
I see you ridin' homie, but that ain't hard enough
You know me I might pull up in an armored truck
I stack big faces, I stack small faces
I stack all faces, swear it's white as pillow cases
I got a dirty mouth but my kitchen's clean
Them folks ridin' hid the pots and the triple beams
Hit the Dodge spot I must've copped six Magnums
Marriott suite, I must've used six magnums
Feds on my tail, you know them boys'll six flag ya
Testarossa ride, like I'm on a coaster ride
Sheet mix, remix still talkin' white bricks
Two million records sold and I'm still talkin' white shit
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I'm the fuckin' future nigga, what you can't see the facts
Ya want them pretty things, I'm the one ya need to ask
They come cross the border, I'm fulfillin' ya order
But the second ya bought her, Fed charges get brought up
I'm whippin' the case, like I'm whippin' the base
Look at daddy in face now tell me how good does it taste
Willie Fal-con, I'm the Dow Jones
Down South where them D-Boys ground zones
We never steal cars, what I'm puttin' miles on
Thirty feet, it cost a couple hundred thousand
My shit bigger than your's, at the biddin' wars
I'm the one they biddin' for, dog I'm just the biggest drought
I'm in the distribution, I'm like Def Jam
Release fish scales, scales on my desk man

[Busta Rhymes speaking over Intro]
Hey yo, Rick Ross
I had the wild coke connect from niggaz from South America
My Guyanese niggaz used to hit me off, ha ha ha ha
Flipmode bitch, yeah
Busta Rhymes, Rick Ross
Now I think you niggaz know what it is
See when the Reaganomics of it was poppin' off
We used to get that inconceivable pop
Rick Ross, go 'head and talk to 'em
[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, I'm the fuckin' boss
Seven forty-five, white on white that's fuckin' Ross
I cut 'em wide, I cut 'em long, I cut 'em fat (What)
I keep 'em comin' back (What), we keep 'em comin' back
I'm in the distribution, I'm like Atlantic
I got them motherfuckers flyin' 'cross the Atlantic
I know Pablo, Noriega, the real Noriega
He owe me a hundred favors
I ain't petty nigga, we buy the whole thang
See most of my niggaz really still deal cocaine
My roof back, my money rides
I'm on the pedal, show you what I'm runnin' like
When they snatch black I cry for a hundred nights
He got a hundred bodies, servin' a hundred lifes

[Verse 2 - Busta Rhymes]
I'm on this shit too, I know ya can't believe
Just call me claustrophobia I leave no room to breathe
While other niggaz done lived see I create a scene
Then I get up on my grind and I hustle to another level to another extreme
Amphetamines, weed the empire that I'm building
Even got a coke connect through Pablo Escobar's children
Heard what I said bitch, Pablo Escobar's children
They call me whenever they manufacture the coke shipment
Whenever there is a drought and we need to place an order
I holla at Manuela Escobar, Pablo's daughter
From Columbia through Bahamas, Florida Keys border
Yes, the hunger for enchilada gets hotter please call her
She gets me coke that makes bodies numb once ya fingers in it
So white, the coke got a sparkle like she got crystals in it
Look, out of town my gangsta's bubblin'
See I will flip and sell you any drug cuz I be hustlin'
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
We never steal cars, but we deal hard
Whip it real hard whip it whip it real hard
I caught a charge, I caught a charge
Whip it real hard, whip it whip it real hard
Ain't bout no funny shit still bitches and business
I'm on my money shit still whippin' them Benzs
Major league who catchin' because I'm pitchin'
Jose Canseco just snitchin' because he's finish
I feed 'em steriods to strengthen up all my chickens
They flyin' over Pacific to be specific
Triple C's you know it's back we holdin' sacks
So nigga go on rat, run and tell 'em that
Mo' cars, mo' hoes, mo' clothes, mo blows

No it's not the silent treatment I let's the bitch vibe
Fire up the kush she hit it, now she's high
Now imagine how she look with cat-eyes and thick thighs
Put her on the payroll 'cause flat out she gets down

Watch that dick standing up, girl it's hard to get down

Uhh
I'm so compassionate with my compositions
Check it
Fascinated with foreign felines
Since I was knee high
This cigar got me buzzin like a beehive
Fuck my old chick I'm ridin with my new thing
In her blue jeans, panties like shoestrings
Most wanted, I'm Bid Laden on a beat nigga
Rubberband jeans saggin on my feet nigga
100 grand for the wagon and her feet nigga
Black flaggin just braggin I'm a street nigga
On the grind little rappers wanna eat with us
Tryin to shine like birdman man teeth glitters
VMA find time just to creep with her
So coincidental walkin down the street with her
My loose cheese scooped up the Gucci
In 2 weeks I flew thru the boutiques
She get her time livin when I let her go and shop
Cruisin in the car click the cuban at the top
Niggas know that my techs explode
Down to go toe to toe before tecmo bowl
Biggest boss in the game, chedder I never mind that
Cause if it matter c murder would go diamond
I reflect as I'm ridin in a Rolls Royce,
Get respect because I give these hoes no choice

Because I
Because I do it
So if you never seen a boss nigga,
Then look at me
Because I do it
And they never seen a boss nigga
But now they see
Because I do it
And I do it
I-I-I-I-I
And I do it
Yeah so now you see what it means
To be a boss cause I do it
I'm the down-south Nas
Click so fur
Ridin with a fox as the cigar burn
Niggas sell weed, niggas sell coke
If I was sellin dope baby id be sellin both
But I'm sellin records everything I touch gold
Better yet check the record 3 million sold
2 hand guns on the writers for the shows
On the road to the riches when I'm ridin on vogues
I elaborate on things I only been bout
Besides, we decides whos the in crowd
If it's ne-yo and niggas who speakin creo
But I got the prove we just keep movin kilos
See the Altima it's call it terminator
The exact watch only war on terminator
I let her ride me like a elevator
Clip another cuban as I wait to celebrate her

Fascinated with foreign felines
That's my design
As I recline cut em like key lime
We both came now it's right back to the tea time
I wanna soda with no vogo and no cheap wine
She told me betterer than man broke
Walkin on the clouds in my second hand smoke
I touched her with the seconds hand stroke
Got her mind racin quicker than a Lambo
2 seater it could'ntfit tacara
But I promise baby I'll be back tomorrow
In a big beamer bumpin Bob Marley
Listen closely and hit a woman softly

Represent Carol City, Dirty South ride wit me

Pullin out the Seven trey, ever-other day

Pull up on them 24's, while I leanin on the doors

Yeah you got the right one, It's Weezy Fuckin Baby
And if your woman lookin, I'll let the woman taste me
Okay now I'm with Khaled, we wilyn in Miami
We got a bunch of bitches, we pile em in the phantom
They follow us to Mansion but I don't mean the club
I'm talking bout my crib, mama I'm trying to fuck
It's Cash Money Baby, It's Young Money Biatch
Now you can swallow that or you can suck a dick
Okay, tell me shit, Lil Wayne fuck a bitch
Lil' nigga, big money, big gun full of that shit
Nigga I ain't Will Smith, Nah, I ain't a fresh prince
Nigga I'm a young king, Nigga I'm a Bun B
Yup, I go hard, ask my broad
Miss Stevie Wonder, she ain't lookin at y'all (She can't see)
The rest goes without me having to say
I say, go, go, go, go (DJ)

Holla at me, What it do, What it is
You ain't never seen a playa like this (Holla at me baby)
I'm a pimp, I'll show her how I live
Take her back then I put it in her wrist (Holla at me baby)

You can see me from a far I'm the shit
Scream at me What it do, What it is (What It Do)

It's Paul Wall baby, Swishahouse club rocker
Chunk a deuce, sip a deuece, pourin up big goose vodka
Lone star beast straight up out the H
Sure stoppin all the hate, sippin on the ski taste
I got the I-N-S on my tail, immigration still harass
Cause they see me in a foriegn ridin on a pointed glass
Gettin cash is my number one task
Until I'm under the grass, that's why I'm top of the class
I'm a grit boy lookin for an ass like Ketoya
Leave a bitch back all nutty like Almond Joy
My boy Toy I E got to sleep
And we got to see and who got the freaks?
Beat it up like an ass whipping
The album dropped and there's been a lot of ass kissing
But I ain't trippin, I'm trill
That's why I'm posted with Khaled cause he real one
A hundred baby like a bill, Holla at me baby
[Chorus]
[Fat Joe]
Nah homie, you done got it fucked up
You ain't got as much money as us (Nope)
We sent Campbell in cause he got goggles on
and he's pushing something far and it's fucked
Now all I gotta do is push a little button quick fast
And the chopper come out of the stash
Yeah money ain't jewels motherfucker you lose
I'll make you do the Fuck Sean Comb dance (Follow me now)
Who wanna come test the kid
Have your baby mama bless the team
Shit, I ain't even know she could twerk it like that
She a motherfuckin sex machine, Holla at me baby

Stuntin in a magnum ridin with my hat low
Forty-five magnum, barrel full of air holes
Dade County, represent, Dopeboy ever since
Know that I'ma veteran, Million dollar president

Off set rims on a rear six inch lips
Started on the benches, rose through the trenches
Now I'm the shit bitch, go and check your senses
Known for the benz's, Chrome on the bentleys
Smokin on the mentleys, Dade county, big cheese
Flip soft, whip that, Rick Ross rip that
Khaled go hard dawg, talk to em Paul Wall
[Chorus]
[Pitbull]
It's Mr. 3-0-5 A.K.A
Mr. Snort yay, spit rocks, made in day
I owe my future to
Last name Campbell, first name Luther
The gun shine stayed, well that shoulda
Bought him the crib, what it do, what it is
Bust a clip, flip a brick, hey buddy where's the lick?
That's all we talk about, well welcome to the south
We in, get our bread then we out, no doubt
Harlas and priests
These boys dirty, they'll fuck your mother, sister, daughter and nieces
Ahora loca, Mueve la cardera, Abre la voca, Alli Viene la Madera

It's over for you clowns soon as my nigga hit them streets
I see you ridin' homie, but that ain't hard enough
You know me I might pull up in an armored truck
I stack big faces, I stack small faces
I stack all faces, swear it's white as pillow cases
I got a dirty mouth but my kitchen's clean
Them folks ridin' hid the pots and the triple beams
Hit the Dodge spot I must've copped six Magnums
Marriott suite, I must've used six magnums
Feds on my tail, you know them boys'll six flag ya

But the second ya bought her, Fed charges get brought up
I'm whippin' the case, like I'm whippin' the base
Look at daddy in face now tell me how good does it taste
Willie Fal-con, I'm the Dow Jones
Down South where them D-Boys ground zones
We never steal cars, what I'm puttin' miles on
Thirty feet, it cost a couple hundred thousand
My shit bigger than your's, at the biddin' wars

I ain't petty nigga, we buy the whole thang
See most of my niggaz really still deal cocaine

While other niggaz done lived see I create a scene
Then I get up on my grind and I hustle to another level to another extreme
Amphetamines, weed the empire that I'm building
Even got a coke connect through Pablo Escobar's children
Heard what I said bitch, Pablo Escobar's children
They call me whenever they manufacture the coke shipment
Whenever there is a drought and we need to place an order
I holla at Manuela Escobar, Pablo's daughter
From Columbia through Bahamas, Florida Keys border
Yes, the hunger for enchilada gets hotter please call her
She gets me coke that makes bodies numb once ya fingers in it

I'm not a slim thug, I'm a fat mack
I don't give a fuck, I'll push ya hat back
Still sellin dubs, nigga, that's fact
You can hit me on the cell pimp, that's that
I had to pawn my chain and grab a half ounce
Ten years later time for me to cash out
You dealin wit a dope dealin dictator
Fuck trafficking nigga, I get this shit catered
See the clip tailored, only the Coogi shit
I fucks wit Damon, I'm in the movies kid
My mom reminisce on the late nights
When I used to reel 'em in with the straight white
'96, Seventeen with a lil' Beamer
First foreign car far from a lil' dreamer
Daddy severed his relationships
I think momma quit him 'cause he wasn't makin shit
Who ever thought that I'd make it rich?
The bottom of the barrel, with a bucket of Crys'
I'm tellin you man... Life a funny thing
You ain't a dope by 'til yo ass got a gun and chain

Ain't scrappin, I'm shootin, they just askin what happened
Ain't shoot then I'm shot, ain't shot then I'm shootin
I ain't caught by the cops, fuck the cops I'm eluding
Ain't hearin the sirens, but I'm seeing the sirens
Ain't seeing the sirens, why am I being so violent?
Thats in the nature of being a nigga
Being beat down, then able to get up
Being let down, then able to sit up
Be the false charge, a nigga acquit it
I ain't hating on ya, dog I pray for ya
Be safe, I heard they got a case for ya
Be straight, stay away from them fake lawyers
You'll be working for the state like you they laywers
Stay loyal, your time will come...
For you to be free and shine like the sun
I'm so blessed, to be in this position
Holdin on my .45 listenin to every whisper...
I'm so blessed, to be in this position
Holdin on my .45 listenin to every whisper...
[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings] (ad-libbing)
It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)
It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)
It's my time
[Verse 3]
Other niggaz sleep, I'm on my job
Soon as cats get 'laxed, I'm going hard
Thats the rules of the game for the underdog
Every wonder dog, long as I been going off (Ross!)
I left it in Gods hands...
Block told me once, ""Ross, this is God's plan""
I'm like ""aw, man"", a man run a label like ""Amen""
Sign a Ray Charles, I could see it all
A lot of undercover agents wanna see me fall
See me fell, in the hell of shells
Expired, no liar, I live the tale
I look forward to working with all the real niggaz
I look forward to looking back on drug dealing
I look forward to making my momma smile once
Look forward, just know I'm smoking them loud blunts
Eight-hundred an ounce, while you running ya mouth
I'm loading the guns... Who running the South?
I'm on ya porch, knocking at ya front door
I got my money right nigga, and I want war
[Chorus: Lyfe Jennings] (ad-libbing)
It's my time (It's my time, yeah, oh)
It's my time (I'm gonna shine, I'm gonna shine)
It's my time (Yeah... yeah... yeaaah)
It's my time (There'll be no stopping me!)
(There'll be no stopping me now)

Fuck football I'm goin' down anotha path
Couldn't pass Da test, To tell da truth
I couldn't fuck with math
I did git a shcolaship, but I blew dat
Got high, got a ticket and I flew back
To da hell zone, most straps stand 20 shell toes
Git life on ya cell phone
Quarta ki box of soda, Ross whip dat
Career criminal fo' sho', Ross with dat
Had to pull my pants up
Boi git 'em brands up
Daddy got some cancer, I neva had da chance ta
Tell him all my plans ta, let em' fuck a danca
Smokin' weed in Amsta-Dam, with his grandson (Damn)

Don't git fucked up, fuck with me - you fucked up
Bitch I'ma ride (Ride), bitch I'ma die (Die)
When I holla 3-0-5, bitch - dat's on my life
Got a 40 in da car, a choppa in da crib
The grenades down da street, you gotta git it how you live (Triple C's)
I know niggas turn 1 into 2 and they do what they do
And boi 'em thangs move
Fishscale git da big mail
In da room full of work
In case they came when they inhale
All I need is bakin soda, some pots and pans

Fuck dat I'm gettin' outta hood
All I need is bakin soda, some pots and pans

When I park it, I can see ya bitch heart-beat
So roll out da red carpet, roll up da purple shit
Black navigator flew
Gotta shut ya fuckin' mouth, don't ever take da smooth
Thinkin' of a greata way, to build a greata flow
I hope she got some great head, dat's how I grade a ho'
White Beamer in da hood shinin' like a star
Look this half a ki go to da club and I'ma buy da bar
Do it twice a week fuckin' bitches on da otha nites
Promise E-class we'll neva miss anotha fight
Hundred in da bag 5 birds I'ma grab
Turn em' into 8, keep me a clean half
Bakin soda in da work works wonderful
You see ya dreams come true cuz I'm da Truth
All I need is bakin soda, some pots and pans

Ain't nothin' but the street life
That's money cars and hoes
It's the only life I chose
Street life , nothin' but the street life
They love they way I shine
This world is mine, all mine
Up early in the morning, got gold in my eye
Got a 4-5 that'll leave a hole in the sky
Sittin at this table, why, to take this ?
Music and the street life that's a whole 'nother side  (riiiight)
Hoes used to call me small time
My clothes ain't know what to call mine
No logos or no tags in it
No polos 'til I started bag-gin' it
Way before my first key
My nigga E showed me
How to parlay a  Z   (good lookin' nigga)
I know my mama pullin' overtime
Pocket full of dimes
So I'm out here pullin' mine
Chorus
You can't close shop, not on my block
I'm 24/7 like IHOP
Came from the bottom to the skybox
Now a penthouse, you can call me Hi-Top
Hop up in the 40-40, got 'bout forty on me
Fifty grand in a band, I'ma roll it homie
Brick layin' cost 'bout another dub
Ten grand for a pound of the bubble bud
Twenty birds in a room down in Atlanta
I caught a bird, but the birds can't buy a camper
Just an example, by an ex-trapper
Dress the coupe in the shoes, now that's dapper
Chorus
Street life, sellin' dope, fuckin' hoes
Big E, smoke comin' outta nigga nose
Candy paintin' on the corner, sellin' everything
I'm on the move, I ain't called mama in a couple days
This life and nothin' will ever change that
I love the game and we'll never give the game back
We lost a lotta good niggaz in the game
But in the game, all the good niggaz get a name
I got a name, everybody don't die the same
Like all dope don't fly the same
M-I-Yayo, boy I buy them thangs
It's like the people want me to come fly the plane
