My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""I'm Killer Mike, I'm Killer Mike, I'm Killer Mike, I'm Killer Mike""}
Rap is dead, rock is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Fuck rap, rap's near death, bloated and sick
Too many niggaz still ride, Big and Pac's dick
Fuck that, next year, they more deader
And I write more rhymes, more deadly and more better
Then the last, sick and disturbed verse I wrote
And sell it to tough teenage boys to quote
Some music to madness, let the anger kill the pain and the sadness
Fuck the fag shit, keep it Killer with the rap shit
Hard rock when you rock shit, back to the block freestyle pop lock shit
Back to the basics with the fuck a cop shit
Rock pussies rap on some pop shit, sing like they rap
Soft and frail, these spirits, didn't have the heart to smell
This is no pain, and it's high octane
A bad brain, on Kobain
Lennon is dead, Kurt is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""Killer Mike, who's the man, Killer Mike, who's the man""}
Rap is dead, rock is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""Killer Mike, who's the man, Killer Mike, who's the man""}
[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
God damnit rappers chitter chattar, on any subject matter
But really does the subject really matter
Pass the guns and blood splatter, does anything fuckin' matter
Pass Cristal, pissed off, fuckin' right I'm pissed off
And you a pistol, yo why the fuck do critics (?)
Now wait a second, don't like what I'm saying
Make a record, and I'll be glad when
My music gets mad again, new school Ice Cube
""Fuck you Killer Mike!"" Yeah fuck you too
No this ain't yo mama's music
It's a drug if you like it, please abuse it
Here's a cool meth-amphetamine for teens
Nightmares comin', crushing ya fuckin' dreams, ultra-shock
Rap rock, bringin' the bars back to rock and hip-hop
Spit it, venom non-stop
Big is dead, Pac is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike, Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike""}
Rap is dead, rock is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike, Hip-Hop is, Killer Mike""}
[Verse 3: Killer Mike]
Knew it was a bad day when I woke up
N.W.A.'s gone and Rage broke up
Damn prayers ain't move the units that they should've
Rappers on top don't spit like they could've
I pledge allegiance to the hard, core
How I give it to you, hard, raw
Ay, a beautiful site to be seen
There's a mosh pit packed with wild teens
Hangin' onto every word that we spit
Ready to rip, rock, and tear shit
Self-pity's fuckin' up my music man
Whine like a bitch or stand and be a man
There's +Black Sabbath+, I'm smoking in a +Zeppelin+
Pumpin' +Metallica+, hand on my weapon
Fuck you and the bed yo bitch slept in
Killer-Kill keeps it real, hardcore is what I'm reppin'
Big is dead, Pac is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""I run shit, Killer Mike, I run shit, Killer Mike""}
Lennon is dead, Kurt is dead
My music's dead, and y'all just scared
{scratched: ""I run shit, Killer Mike, I run shit, Killer Mike""}
Rap is dead, Killer Mike

Aye, aye Bun who did this man?
So me and you got, T.I.P., Killer Mike, Lil Jon, and Bun B
So that's the King of the South.. the Underground King..
the King of Crunk.. and King Kong all on the same song
Heheh.. aye Jon, they ain't ready
We taking it on back to the trap my nigga!
[Hook]
I got them 'bows on my 'lac - swervin on these niggaz!
I got the hoe up in the back - bumpin niggaz figgaz!
I got the weed in my sack - smokin on that killa!
In the hood where I'm at - trappin with my niggaz!
I got the NEW NEW... (Killa K-K-K-Killa Killa...)
NEW NEW... (K-K-K-Killa Killa..)
NEW NEW... (K-K-K-Killa Killa..)
NEW NEW... (Niggaz don't wanna touch the Killa..)
[T.I.]
Man we been throwin raps for too long
Aye whatchu wanna do homes?
I'm finna pull this heat and have you fetal like a new-born
T.I.P., Mike, and Bun B - scared whatchu better be
We was just the kings, now we heads of a legacy
Leaders of the new south, fake niggaz move out
He talkin loud and proud, but he scared with a tool out
I'm the nigga they be askin what we gon' do bout?
Mike told me ""fuck them niggaz, bring that New New out""
Tank the Chevy, buy the Caddie, bring the 22's out
Put the city back on top, just seperate the fools now
We had lots of misrepresentation but hey we cool now
Can't keep playin both sides of the fence, you got to choose now
The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake
If ya got it on ya chest, shawty say it to my face
When ya hold ya nuts in hatred, ya only rushin til ya wait
And we gon' show them people what it really is in the A
[Hook]
[Killer Mike]
Straight from Atlanta, the hog hand-ler
Grown folk trap, scramb-ler
Knee deep, means to get them G's to my manager
My mack-10 made for action, body-baggin and throat braggin
I'll drag 'em threw the river like a bad yellow nigga
I'm mashin with pops fashion, bustin first no questions askin
You gon' off that waterboat and thinkin you can hold me
I'm, King Kong on every track, no cap-sule can hold me
I'll THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP, when I BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP!
It's woofers, tweeters, speakers, geekers, ALL IN YO' TRUNK!
My dad ain't raise no fag, my mom ain't had no punk
We don't hesitate or negotiate, we pop Chevy trunks
From the home of Coca-Cola, I'm not referrin to soda
I'ma grind til I shine, or die going for mine
Sick Sawyer buy my side, swervin and blowin pine
Don't be a victim to a Killer, be a father to ya son
This Re-Akshon, Killa Kill, T.I.P., and Bun
[Hook]
[Bun B]
Bitch I'm coming live from the trunk and I thrive on the funk
Cuz I'd rather die like a man than survive like a punk
I'm no coward, I'm 'dro-powered, you gettin Twin-Towered
devoured - it's a shit-storm and you bout to get showered
From Broward county to Harris, Pasadena to Paris
I embarrass niggaz on chrome wheels as big as the ferris
Cuz there is, now way now how - I stay low-key, low-brow
In that black on black on black in the 'lac cuz I'm so wild
I get, drunk off that, I'll be high off this
I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss
They put me hot on list, where players are posted
But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted
And the prayer get toasted, cuz I keep the flame on
The face for the game on - leave a stain on anything I puts my name on
Disrespect and the tech'll peck a player like Woody
Cuz cain't nuttin keep a trill nigga down, ask Khujo Goodie
[Hook]
[Killer Mike talking]
All I gotta say is sucker emcees better run
The debate is now, who's the greatest emcee?
T.I.P., Killer Mike, or Bun?
We are not doing this for fun - this is a bloodsport
Emcees are dying, mothers are crying
and wack-ass niggaz will go out trying
It is officially a new day, I am officially the new mouth
AND THESE ARE THE EMCEES OF THE NEW SOUTH!!

[Intro - Andre 3000]
Yeah! Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell (Boo!)
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[Verse One]
K-I-L-L
This is the name that came to alter the game
Not like these rappers who spit it the same
Separate lames from they chain
My mind don't slack
I'm totally focused on beating up tracks
Monsterous music to beat in your 'Lac
1000 watt amp with woofers in back
Lean to da left if you burning a sac
Baby got back and its in Baby Phat
Pardon me dog 4 chasing the cat
I'm hittin all kittens meowing like that
I like the front but I'm loving the back
I like to bite and I'm hoping she scratch
Escalade dipping I'm holding the lane
Mama's a scholar she blowing my brain
Ain't the the life?
Snapping & Trappin and Rappin & Frappin all night
Lil mama's a plumber she handling pipe
Ill wit a pill she handle it right
Like Iverson, the smallest thing on the team
But the livest one
Cocked loaded bust like a gun
Y'all better run, one, one!
[Hook - Big Boi]
Thump, thump, thump, thump (yeah)
All in your trunk (yeah)
Grinding and hustling and getting at mine
Swerving and token and grippin on pine
Bump, bump, bump, bump
All in your trunk
Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers
Crawl in your bunk
[Verse Two]
How we gon' stop (whooa)
How we gone quit (shitttt!)
Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy
I came through swerving like this (errrrr!)
Good wit the game, gutter fo' show
Ducking you lames and obstacles
Don't get that ass in a hospital
Wrapped in a cast from head to toe
This boy he real!
Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills
My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels
First round pick like Michael Vick
Quarterback status throw passes at chicks
Santana Moss When catching the ball
Get it? Like Moss she catches the ball
Perfectly tuned my engine don't stall
And I'm equipped with nitros y'all
Ready to rip, burn, roar!
Ready to tear through your city and tour
Took The Whole World and murdered that shit!
Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch!
Later for now I'm hustling hits
Flipping my words like bricks, trick!
[Hook]
[Outro]
New, new! That new-new!
New-new for you-you!

All points in the region related gangsterish
Serving dark dishes of true pimp horror
Warriors stormy nights on leathery wings
Sexy sirens in dreams of king Stephen killer mike
Mad stalking midnight
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Westside riders keep it (gangsta)
Southside hustlers keep it (gangsta)
Eastside killers keep it (gangsta)
Northside monsters keep it (gangsta)
[Killer Mike]
See I in the V.I. staggerin and weed eyed
Stumbling and laughin rollin in with 'kast 'nem
Cold weather bubble goose 4-5er mashin
From G.A. to L.A. Force 1's be my fashion
Disrespect my space I'll push yo fuckin back in
Spit in your face and hand your faggot ass a napkin
Everything you did mu'fucka we done done done
Ran streets took over traps carry gun gun
I'm from a hood full of junkies and pastor sons
We don't give a fuck how hard you come we don't run
Our moms ain't raise no faggot ain't nothing queer nigga
We don't give a fuck blood'll smear right here nigga
[Chorus]
[Killer Mike]
Shit
Them killers in the cut they conspiring they conniving
Aint no fifth for them niggaz them niggaz shit we ride with
Them fur coat and champagne suckers better hide when
They peep a team of gully motherfuckers bout to slide in
These bullets leave you shakin like that dance from N.Y. and
I put that on my children and my young nephew Ty and
And my nigga Kimjohn years away from frying
He send me letters telling me how grown men be crying
When they surrounded by rapists with lustful eyes in
The belly of the beast where they don't let no light in
Red velvet robbin crews totin lead pipes in
To your suburban home throwin on kids and wife and
You go spaghetti when these killers strike like lightning
Niggaz go spaghetti when these killers strike like lightning
[Chorus]
[Killer Mike]
Shit
We don't give a fuck bout who your homeboy friends is
We don't give a fuck bout what series your benz is
All we gives a shit about is up all night trappin white
Cop that yay weigh it right till lay lay equals glass pipe
My side of town don't act right
Every damn day is fight night
These motherfuckers don't act ok
These motherfuckers just spray they k
Down the block over rocks hot 4-5's be coughin
Mothers who couldn't afford shoes and socks
They purchase coffins
You scared motherfucker you scared (rich nigga)
You scared motherfucker you scared (bitch nigga)
You scared motherfucker you scared (snitch nigga)
You scared motherfucker you scared (trick nigga)
[Chorus] - 2X

All those who oppose higher glory beware
For candelit crypt comes open and monsters see

(All day I dream about sex)
The way you move your sexy groove
I've got my mind all over you

(All day I dream about sex)
You say you were so sick of it
I'm tired of jackin' off cause you ain't there
[Verse 1: Big Boi]
65 Cevrolet Ipala peachy cream
Cruisin' down the street like two fingers
Cause the ivory is clean
Talkin' 'bout meetin' at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Cause she mobile than a grip
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Tell em' a good game, juju pimpin'
Give em' to my nigga Dime Legit
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
It's a camel toe and thats fo' sho
My brain is on one track
Like Mary Mary toss for crackle like a rock star does for smack
None of that but the female genatalia's where it's at
I'm a man and I demand a WO-man for that act
Personal preference cause I use the law of nature as a reference
No I don't ever recall seein' a man turn up pregnant
But that's just me
From them female fantasies frolic freely
In my cock pit, every 30 some seconds I can't stop it
[Chorus]
[Killer Mike]
Killer Kill from Adamsville and in a Bonneville I chill
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Doctors call the thing vagina, in the hood we call it trim
White boys call it snatch, Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra
Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
I promise I got you tomorrow
[Chorus]
[Killer Mike]
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I dont need that A-I-D-S
A D and an A missin' out my ADIDAS
PLUS, We don't need no DNA mixin' between us
We just need to keep this thing friendly and hush hush
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
From the tour bus to the lobby, elevator to the room
We can jump each others bones but there's no jumpin' brooms
[Big Boi]
Buffoon you are too consumed in the womb
It is too early for you to jump the broom, BOOM

Welcome home motherfuckers your back again
into the den of inequity the life of sin
Where after the after party and the hotel lobbies
probably find me drunk off Bacardi in a swank hotel
an aspiring actress
Trying to push her back through a thousand dollar mattress
In Chicago a couple of bottles, couple of models, stolen Diablos
Fast and furious going full throttle
post club function, pills get swallowed
Ladies get loose and so do bra staps
power, money, and sex drive good raps
Freaks emerge in a twilight with party pack
of hydros alchohol blurred eye sight
From dusk til dawn is when vampires roam
pro athletes trick and don't go home

Riding with my nigga Big Boi you don't sleep
even partied with Diddy up in NYC
Got drunk, rubbed titties of Dominican freaks
every night bachelor party in the boom boom room
On trees get burned or liquor consumed
you ain't really seen a color till you seen it on shrooms
Lipstick on the pale of my Pelle Pele
spot hotter than fish scales cooked in coked ale
Vampire party and we gets it down
in the undergrounds underground
Underground in club commer's basement
ladies and low lifes do get wasted
So high you can't hear the music but you feel it when the bass hits
the atmosphere like the first year
Freak bass hit everybodys heart goes fast
rolling Mitsubishi's shakin' that ass
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Bizzare]
Got twenties on the Escort, bitch park my shit
It's Bizzare from D12 in this bitch (yeah)
and wich nigga want to fight (what!)
I'm the club with Suge Knight, Ike, and Killer Mike (how does it feel)
Fat dick for all my enemies
caught a disease fucking Roy and Jazzie T (a ha ha)
My girlfriends a fucking fool
when she turned her back
I'm making out with her mother like I'm in high school (shhh)
And I don't sale crack to my African brothers
I sell it to they mothers and they ex-lovers (that's true)
So go ahead bitch pop the X
so I can work your neck in the back of my Vett (ahh!)
Red bones, I hate 'em no question
I like fat bitches with bladder infections (ughh)
Bizzare get down from strokers to Magic City
It's the creep show, show your nasty titties

Welcome to the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show
anything goes strippers and live shows

exctasy, hydro, and good blow
It's the creep show, street show, freak show, peep show

Where hustlas collect rocks and straight rolls
[Verse 1: Killer MIke]
Welcome home motherfuckers your back again
into the den of inequity the life of sin
Where after the after party and the hotel lobbies
probably find me drunk off Bacardi in a swank hotel
an aspiring actress
Trying to push her back through a thousand dollar mattress
In Chicago a couple of bottles, couple of models, stolen Diablos
Fast and furious going full throttle
post club function, pills get swallowed
Ladies get loose and so do bra staps
power, money, and sex drive good raps
Freaks emerge in a twilight with party pack
of hydros alchohol blurred eye sight
From dusk til dawn is when vampires roam
pro athletes trick and don't go home

(Screwed) PURPLE LABEL
So niggaz want to know the story
Why the label got changed from Aquemini to Purple Ribbon, shorty?
Where Dre at man? Why isn't him and Big on TV man
Them boys still down? Organized goin' through changes
All I know is that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
(Scratched) All I know that Big here, Dre gone, moved on
(Scratched) Big here, Dre gone, moved on
Changed names from Aquemini to Purple Rib-bon
My first album slept on, failed to do a mil
But yet and still, my babies haven't missed a meal
God damn, is there a curse on Dungeon Fam?
The Goodie Mob broke up, the DF album didn't jam
Before Lil Jon had the grill in his mouth
Khujo Goodie had the dreads with the grill in his mouth
And Bubba Sparxxx gave you the phrase new south
Like Cool Breeze gave you the phrase dirty south
Is it only me? Or does Pharrell sometimes remind niggaz of
Sleepy Brown back in '93?
I know its been like 12 Decembers (yeah, suttin' like that)
Let's remember ""All the playas came from far and wide""
Yeah suttin' like that, talkin playalistic Cadillac
In the trap with +Two Dope Boyz+
Spittin Organized Noize via microphone
Do you believe The Source gave only gave 4 and a half microphones
They shoulda gave that a classic, ax Charlie Braxton
Damn man, I'm still amazed
The boys had the nerve to boo Big and Dre
When they hit the stage to accept the Source award
My heart dropped like a million other country boys
I thought my Mind was Playin Tricks like the Geto Boys
Damn man, I miss the interludes by Big Rube
He gave us knowledge that they wouldn't give us in school
So our mind wasn't so sick
Speakin' of being sick man I need a doctor
Which doctor? Bring back the Witch Doctor
(Scratched) Feelin' me, bring back the Witch Doctor
Feelin' me, here's an interesting fact from me
When the boy Bobby V signed with DTP
He spit about blackberry molasses over Organized beats

And my nigga Kimjohn years away from frying

When they surrounded by rapists with lustful eyes in
The belly of the beast where they don't let no light in

To your suburban home throwin on kids and wife and
You go spaghetti when these killers strike like lightning
Niggaz go spaghetti when these killers strike like lightning

Servin a 40 to life sentence for dope that wasnt even his
Just sit back and listen Ill tell you
Its some hillarious thangs boy
And its a wild wild chain of events that gets yo ass in here

Momma I don't wanna sell
Birds no more ( I gotta fuckin funny story to tell yall)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor ( you remember me and big paul and my whole crew)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor (government snitches are paid)
Momma I don't wanna sell
Crack no more ( listen it gon take about 3 minutes just listen)

After high school I gained lots a weight
And I ain't talkin bout calories put on by state
The recipie I'm cookin may send me upstate
Use bakin soda cook the pie collect cake, not Pillsbury
These niggaz kick down doors find out where millsbury
Shits very intense and critical
And when we drew pistols shit got pitiful
The first leak was bullshit a half a brick
We robbed the middle man and a bum bitch
The dumb bitch
But between me and him and that whore
We walked away wit 18 and a bigger score
Some nigga named Salvator from El Salvador
Got silver teeth and a star on his jaw
Young Antonio Montana
Held up mansion North Atlanta
We hit 'em hard and stores hammer YEA!

Momma I don't wanna sell
birds no more
(ok I know wat you thinkin its on right we on right we on)

Crack no more

I little spot had more birds than a pet shop
More guns than a Vietnam Vet
We was set
Loaded up the work and lets jet
My nigga Big Paul loaded up the uhaul
1000 pounds uncut raw
Hold on wats that I saw in the distance
Did he have a crew offerin resistance
Pauley said ""its probly nothin
A small animal or somethin""
My nerves got ta jumpin
I swear I herd somethin
I pointed the 4 fifth in the wind and start dumpin
Now blue light is comin
My crew is runnin
Cops is everywhere they keep comin
All of us sick
And all of us caught holdin our dick
We robbed the nigga the same day the fuckin feds hit
We robbed the nigga the same day the fuckin feds hit
Me and Salvador fucked up in the mix
That middle man the dumb bitch
Them niggaz snitched GOT DAMN!!

Birds no more

They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor

Momma I don't wanna sell
Crack no more

Stayed my fuckin ass in job court doin this dumb ass shit

But all should feel the wrath just like when my heart was taken
And if these words fail to reach their ears and for limit their view
you won't know but when I stryke you'll wish that you've of knew...
This beast is on the loose, if you treasure life then destroy it
for it is too realistic for you to simply ignore it

Mike told me ""fuck them niggaz, bring that New New out""
Tank the Chevy, buy the Caddie, bring the 22's out
Put the city back on top, just seperate the fools now
We had lots of misrepresentation but hey we cool now
Can't keep playin both sides of the fence, you got to choose now
The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake
If ya got it on ya chest, shawty say it to my face
When ya hold ya nuts in hatred, ya only rushin til ya wait
And we gon' show them people what it really is in the A
[Hook]
[Killer Mike]
Straight from Atlanta, the hog hand-ler
Grown folk trap, scramb-ler
Knee deep, means to get them G's to my manager
My mack-10 made for action, body-baggin and throat braggin
I'll drag 'em threw the river like a bad yellow nigga
I'm mashin with pops fashion, bustin first no questions askin
You gon' off that waterboat and thinkin you can hold me
I'm, King Kong on every track, no cap-sule can hold me
I'll THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP, when I BUMP BUMP BUMP BUMP!
It's woofers, tweeters, speakers, geekers, ALL IN YO' TRUNK!
My dad ain't raise no fag, my mom ain't had no punk
We don't hesitate or negotiate, we pop Chevy trunks
From the home of Coca-Cola, I'm not referrin to soda
I'ma grind til I shine, or die going for mine
Sick Sawyer buy my side, swervin and blowin pine
Don't be a victim to a Killer, be a father to ya son
This Re-Akshon, Killa Kill, T.I.P., and Bun
[Hook]
[Bun B]
Bitch I'm coming live from the trunk and I thrive on the funk
Cuz I'd rather die like a man than survive like a punk
I'm no coward, I'm 'dro-powered, you gettin Twin-Towered
devoured - it's a shit-storm and you bout to get showered
From Broward county to Harris, Pasadena to Paris
I embarrass niggaz on chrome wheels as big as the ferris
Cuz there is, now way now how - I stay low-key, low-brow
In that black on black on black in the 'lac cuz I'm so wild
I get, drunk off that, I'll be high off this
I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss
They put me hot on list, where players are posted
But them players we posted up on corners, when they say and get roasted
And the prayer get toasted, cuz I keep the flame on
The face for the game on - leave a stain on anything I puts my name on
Disrespect and the tech'll peck a player like Woody
Cuz cain't nuttin keep a trill nigga down, ask Khujo Goodie

[Killer Mike talking]
All I gotta say is sucker emcees better run
The debate is now, who's the greatest emcee?
T.I.P., Killer Mike, or Bun?
We are not doing this for fun - this is a bloodsport
Emcees are dying, mothers are crying
and wack-ass niggaz will go out trying
It is officially a new day, I am officially the new mouth

(Killer Mike talking on the phone)
Aight... so you niggaz wanna know how a nigga is up in jail...
Servin' a 40 to life sentence...
For dope that wasn't even his
Just sit back and listen, I'll tell you
It's a hilarious day boooyyy, and it's a wild, wild chain of events
that get yo ass in hea...
[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't wanna sell, birds no more
(I got a fuckin' funny story to tell you)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(You rem'ber me and big Paul and my whole crew nigga?)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(Government snitches are amazin...)
Mama, I don't wanna sell, crack no more
(Just listen, only take about 3 minutes, just listen)
[Verse 1]
After high school, I gained lots of weight
And I ain't talkin' bout calories put on by steak
The recipe I'm cookin' may send me upstate
Use bakin' soda, cook the pie, collect cake
Now Pillsbury, these niggaz kick down doors
Find out what mills bury
Shit's very intense and criti-cal
And when we drew pistols shit got piti-ful
The first lick was bullshit, a half a brick
We robbed the middle man and a bum bitch, the dumb bitch
But between me and him and that hoe
We walked away with 18 and a bigger score
Some nigga named Salvatore from El Salvador
Got silver teeth and a scar on his jaw
Young Antonio Montana, held up mansion north Atlanta
We hit'em hard as doors hammer, yea!
[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't wanna sell, birds no more
(Okay, I know whachu thinkin', it's on righ, we on righ, we on)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(Hold up, hold up, hold up, be patient, be patient, listen to the rest
listen, listen)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(Man I feel like a asshole just tellin' you this man)
Mama, I don't wanna sell, crack no more
(Tell the kid to give me the card, check it out
here's where it gets interestin, follow this shit)
[Verse 3]
??? the spot had more birds than a pet shop
More gunz than a Vietnam vet, we was set
Loaded up the work and let's jet
My nigga big Paul loaded up the U-Haul
A thousand pounds uncut raw
Hold on, whus that I saw in the distance?
Did he have a crew offerin assistance?
Paul said it's prolly nuthin', a small animal or somethin'
My nerves got to jumpin', I swear I heard somethin'
I pointed the 4-5th in the wind and started thumpin'
The blue lights is comin', my crew is runnin'
Cops is everywhere, they keep comin'
All of us sick, and all of us caught, holdin our dick
We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin FEDs hit
We robbed the niggaz, same day the fuckin FEDs hit
Me and Salvatore fucked up in the mix
That middle man and dumb bitch
Them niggaz snitched, GOD DAMN!
[Chorus] (Killer Mike talking)
Mama, I don't wanna sell, birds no more
(So young man, that's why the fuck I'm sittin here wearin these pants ???)
They pushed me down and locked me up
Put my face on the floor
(I hear Salvatore got ??? or some shit)
They took my money and my credit card
Now I'm poor
(The bum bitch that snitched, tss... who knows?)
Mama I don't wanna sell, crack no more
(Man I shoulda fuckin stayed in job corp
stayed my fuckin ass in job corp, doin dumbass shit
now I'm fuckin round witchall stupid ass niggaz too
ain't no niggaz in jail but dumb niggaz

Whoa, baby, whoa, baby, whoa, baby
La la la, la la la, yeah..
[Chorus - 2x]
I would never leave you girl (My girl, my wife)
You know I love you (My pain, my strife)
Oh baby, oh baby
I would never leave you girl (Good days, bad nights)
You know I love you (Lovely fistfights)
Oh baby, oh baby
[Killer Mike]
Killa for, look at us, forvever fucked up
All we do is fuck, fight, and get X'ed up
Enough, enough
We bad for each other, mama
But our sex life ain't right without drama
In combat, sweet agony upon that
I deliver, make you take it soft and break it hard
Like dope dealers, I'm a husband to a wife
But I'm ya nigga, and you a perfect drug
Make a nigga heart quiver
You a hard breakin hard liquor on my liver
Like 'dro and gin go together, you a mind shifter
Body dark like a Cognac, I'm pissy drunk
In light ??, I stay drunk
My pretty little vampire, my delila
Teach me how to hate the truth and how to love a liar
You a vicious mind-bending ??
You the perfect drug, ultimate high, and I'm a fiend
Chorus
[Killer Mike]
You're my path to the pen or the crazy house
I deliver dick raw and won't take it out
Either that or you the devil's daughter, can't fake it
Killing me slow, I know and I can't shake it
Please stay, please leave, please don't go
Please walk away and let me be to die slow
This love is deeper than the grave and it's forever
Snake pit, you're venom beyond measure
Pandora's box a lot, my treasure
If love is strong as the grave, make me deader
Jezibelle got my soul and my cheddar
Everytime I beat it down, it jumps wetter
Like a dark cloud, bringing me pain and bad weather
I remain inside of your rain with no umbrella
I couldn't write the words, I blame this letter
Til death do us part, we deserve to be together
Chorus
[Killer Mike]
A living drug, you're the bitch I hate to love
Learned to suck good dick by fuckin' thugs
A nigga can't teach you, spread like a track meet
Breaking D-boys, MCs, and athletes, but not me
Told you from the start this shit is forever
We gon' go through this bad weather together
Whether the road or high side, you gon' ride
Through the fistfights and black eyes, it's you and I
Ike and Tina, our love is measured on a milimeter
They say a partner don't love a nigga til a nigga eat her
But I'm raw, and tired of the motherfuckin talking
I'll be goddamned if you hit the door walking
I'm stalkin, the depths of Atlantis, evil enchantress
Slick and underhanded
Fuckin with you like dancing with the devil, no command bitch
No ?? leaving niggaz empty-handed
I lost everything I had just to lust you
Bitch, you take another step and I'll bust you
Bitch you take another step and I'll bust you

To rid myself of all the terror visions,

Anger twisted your life into pain.

its thrown in my face everyday
guess thats the price i have to pay
for whats inside my mind
a-live!
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive
a-live!
little things tempt me everyday
lots of pain is how i like to play
better not cross that line
voices in my head have to be saved
its something i cant throw away
whats inside my mind
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive
i find my time
im in a twine
im falling in this place i thought i left behind
(feeling so alive)
a-live!
i am alive
i will never run away
places inside
my heart screams inside with pride
once i cried
now i wipe away the tears
once i died
now im alive

This place inside my mind, a place I like to hide
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!
Another place I find to escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances. What if I should die?!
A place inside my brain, another kind of pain
You don't know the chances. I'm so blind!
Deeper and deeper and deeper as I journey to
live a life that seems to be a lost reality
that can never find a way to reach.
My inner selfesteem is low.
How deep can I go in the ground that I lay?
If I don't find a way to see through the gray that clouds my mind.
This time I look to see what's between the lines!
I can see, I can see, I'm going blind...
I'm blind

Facing existence
How can I relate?
Do I stand here or move on?

Buried in this hurt of mine
Falling slowly like a dream
Falling through a world unseen
Why can I not break this spell?

He stuffed the stockings with reefers and beer,
and a big fat hairy dick for the family queer.
That's the end of my story. Funny wasn't it, ya see?
One, two, three, four, Santa can suck my dick all day!

but I got everybody jumping to the voodoo.
You kickin' wicked rhymes, picket signs,
me and my mob got a truck full of 9's.
Play ya and I'll slay ya,

I'll rock that test tube baby, take it...

still got a deuce that'll bunny hop the curb.
Nappy head, nappy chest, nappy chin,
never seen with a happy grin,
show the phat frown cause I'm down,
so take a look around,
all you see is big black boots steppin',
use my steel toe as a weapon.
Kick ya and flip ya,
now they want to label this nigger,
tape with the sticker.
Kickin out girls that's nasty,
'cause I got a body count like Ice-T.
From in New York
I get them skins, and I ain't talking about pork.
Your sly, you pig, dig,
listen from the flow from a soul fro'ed caucasian,
oh, your picket signs, you know all
this funky ass wisdom picket budget talking.
'Cause I get Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire
Yes I Wicked! I told them not to keep on their fire
MY NAME IS HIV,  so you'll keep on your fire
People wanna know how come I got a Gat
and I'm sitting at the window like Malcolm,
ready to bring that noise
and going to get heavy like the Ghetto Boyz.
DECEMBER 29th was power to the people,
and you might just see a sequel,
'cause police got equal pay,
a horse is a pig that don't fly straight.
I'm doin' Daryl Gates but it's Willie Willams,
I'm down with the pilgrims,
I'm through with the pig,
so I think the job is dead, get out...

Went to my sisters room, ""Yo bitch wake up""

This story began five years ago
Took a funky idea and began to roll
By doing something that was never done
While getting paid, still having fun
Being explicit straight from the streets
Not forgettin' our roots to an up-tempo beat
Taking what they say just for granted
For us to give up, that's what they wanted
To do it all, we'd be taking shorts
'Cause at that time we were given no thought
To follow another; we didn't see it
We're the example for others to see
In the beginning all we had was a phone
And trust in each other was how we lived on
Word was bond, we relied on true
Faith in each other backed up by Luke
Chorus
[We are]
[Ghetto Style]
[Perched in the South]
[The king of the ghetto]
[The man, not a myth]
Verse 2: Brother Marquis
The journey was long, but we fought the struggle
We paid off in the end by the bundles
In the beginning, some were against us
But we proved them wrong, and made them envious
So we kept on writing, the public kept on buying
What we were making, they took a-likin'
We found the market, hit the target
We started the fire, but it's you who sparked it
We stayed independent, and we didn't sell out
We started off with no help from the White House
The plot was perfect, though we needed a gimmick
So we thought up this dance called Throw the Dizznick
In no time at all, things started growin'
Charts were showin' that sales were soarin'
Then all the talkin', all the squawkin',
They tried to take the name, but keep Skyy-walkin'
Chorus
Verse 3
[FKI] A black thing, from beginning to end
Brothers in the business and loyal friends
Steppin' on stages, movin' as one
For the money and for the fun
No matter how it goes, how bad it seems,
When once seem down, we all come clean
[BM] In unity, we all stand strong
We all step together, no man walks alone
No matter what, they can't stop us
They ain't doin' us just 'cause, when it's just us
Any circumstance we must overcome
Let's keep the dream alive, and all get some
And never mind those people with the negative vibe
And never mind the people with the evil eyes
'Cause they all flippin' somewhere out on a trip
'Cause they don't understand the man and the myth

What the fuck is yo name mutha fucka??.
Long Rod?..
Fat frank??
Stiff Peter'stiff,  stiff peter
I'm gonna let you guys in on a private personal part of my life, and ladies listen up?..I may just save your relationship
They took a dick from California, transplanted that mutha fucka to Washington DC and it fucked the nation?.
An answer'an answer??? and my latest thrill is to bust my nuts in a bitch's mouth
CHORUS:
That Dick Almighty ?all'almighty, that Dick Almighty?..all'almighty?.that dick??????almighty
Dick Almighty's of no surprise'it'll fuck all the bitches
All shapes and size
She'll climb a mountain, even run the block
Just to kiss the head of this big black cock
He'll tear the pussy open cuz its satisfaction, the bitch won't leave its fatal attraction.
Dick so powerful she'll kneel and pray, awaiting her time hoping soon to slay
That dick?.will make a bitch cry, when fuckin a bitch that's tight inside
That dick ?.has got a spell on you, once it gets inside you'll act a fool
That dick?.will make a bitch act cute, suck my dick bitch and make it puke
Jump up on it, grab it like you want it?
If you could wear a dick'bitch, you would flaunt it
CHORUS
Bitches are the one's thinkin dicks get soft, they fuck one time and they got off
Thinkin its slick just to ride the dick, they'll make a nigga cum and then he'll quit?
But not the long one'I won't play that shit, put her ass in the buck and kill the clit
Its 15 inches long, eight inches thick'last name almighty first name is dick
That dick'is a mutha fucka, I cant be pussy whipped by a dick sucka
That dick'will drive a bitch crazy, bitches wanna fuck when your tired and lazy
That dick'sometimes costs you money, don't be blamed for a child that's not yours dummy.
That dick'is a greedy bitch's dinner?.I let a bitch feed before I go up in her
CHORUS
Bitches go crazy at the all night fuck, starting from the back then to the buck
Since a good dick is hard to find,  I kill that pussy then fuck your mind
Bitches like the dick just claim defeat, forget the salad just eat my meat
They pay big dollars cuz they don't dumb freaks, to spend time with the Dick the Almighty
That dick'will make ya cheat on yo man
Make you so freaky and hot in the ass
That dick'will make ya hurt yourself
When you don't have dick you'll finger fuck yourself
That dick?.is an awful thing but you bull-dykin bitches are fuckin up the game, rubbin belly to belly and skin to skin, fuckin like hell but aint no dick going in
CHORUS
OUTRO
When a women is about to grab my private personal parts??I want her to grab my private personal parts??grab my private personal parts
This record is dedicated to all you gals who don't appreciate us men enough?
A Hard man is good to find?..a hard man is good to find

just get on the floor and throw that D

just listen up close i'll explain to you
just jump in th air
and when you land youll mind like you just don't care
it's all in the hips, so go berserk
and let that D do the work
so while it's workin' you'd better start strokin'
to show your partner that you ain't jokin'
'cuz this ain't a dance from mother goose
better freak your body and turn it loose
'cuz when you're on the floor you don't give a shit

(Mixx scratches ""Bad ass bitch!"")
(During the breakdowns, we hear the Crew just hangin' out,
chit-chatting about their sexual encounters. Most of their
words are inaudible.)
Verse 1: Fresh Kid Ice
There's always one bitch in every town
Every time you see her, her panites are down
Always dressed fresh in the ladies' wear
She sports the weave instead of hair
Known to the boys as a real fly cutie
Tight-ass jeans to show that booty
When we met, I acted grinnin'
'Cause in my book, she was a queen
I felt that feelin', anticipation
Later came the stories of a reputation
She was burnin' since she was born
I fucked anyway, 'cause the bitch was ON!
Chorus
Verse 2: Brother Marquis
When we first met, I'll never forget
'Cause her lips were moist, a touch soft and wet
We danced, to a funky tune
And stared at each other in a smoke-filled room
I said, ""What's up? Are you down with it?
Let's go to the crib so I can run up in it!""
So we left the club for this night full of fun
I'm out for a splak, 'cause I'm not the one
For no bullshit or love-silly games
Let's get butt-booty naked and do the wild thing
First she took off her panties, snatched off her bra
Out popped the biggest tits I ever saw
They were big enough to knock a man down
They were shaped like grapes, and my favorite shade of brown
My dick was hard, and she was hot like a heater
By the looks of her mouth, she was a dick-eater
I said, ""You raggedy bitch, don't play dumb!
Put my dick in your mouth and make this motherfucker cum!!""
Yeah! This bitch was ON!!
Chorus
Verse 3
[BM] The head was smokin', I had to call my friends
In the next ten minutes, all the boys were in
Dat was in the front and Lat was in the back
The pussy was poppin' like Cracker Jack!
[FKI] She had to get paid; I put her in the trick
I gave her a penny for every inch of my dick
We kept on fuckin' 'till the early morn
[ALL] THAT BITCH WAS ON!!!

(gong noise)
[Luke]:WELCOME TO THE FUCK SHO-O-O-OP!
Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
There's only one place where we can go
Where the price is right just to fuck a ho
It's always popular with the girls and the guys
'Cause for all my money, it's the best buy
Ten dollars, two hours is the time of the stay
It's more than enough time to slay
Each room has a bed and also a sink
So you can wash your dick after fucking the pink
But be careful of the things that you use'
Cause you can get arrested for sex abuse
So as you hit the door and the panties drop,
Whole lot of suckin' and fuckin' at the Fuck Shop!
Verse 2:  [Brother Marquis]
Please come inside, make yourself at home
I want to fuck, 'cause my dick's on bone
You little whore behind closed doors
You would drink my cum and nothing more
Now spread your wings open for the flight
Let me fill you up with something milky and white
'Cause I'm hopin' to slay you, rough and painful
You innocent bitch, don't be shameful
Bring out the ice cubes and the hot water
This is the second half, and not the second quarter
I'll fuck you 'till you sleep; you'll sleep like a baby
And in your dreams, you'll say I'm crazy
In the Fuck Shop!
[Luke] (squeaky voice): YOU'RE IN THE FUCK SHOP, BABEEEE!I WANNA SEE YOU FREAK!!
Verse 3:  [Luke]
In the Fuck Shop!  That's where it's at!
In the Fuck Shop!  The place to splak!

I am the dominating Fresh Kid Ice
And I am the Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
And introducing to you on the two turntables:
The Treach DJ Mr. Mixx
(Word)
[ VERSE 1: Brother Marquis ]
We get the red carpet treatment cause we're well respected
Always accepted and never rejected
Our defense is made when we take the stage
The crowd gets excited and goes in a rage
Cause we're generating and demonstrating
All of the talents that we're accumulating
And by doing this we'll go real far
Because - 2 Live is what we are
We're highly publicized and advertised
Our music's in your ear, our face in your eyes
We're good to go and goin to be good
We've done the right thing like you knew we would
Because we are here for your dancing pleasure
With our microphones, cause that's what we treasure
Now the man you see, who has hands of magic
His name is Mr. Mixx, so come on a scratch it
[ VERSE 2: Brother Marquis ]
You can call me Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
The t-e-s-t I pass with with flying colors
I'm capable and on the case
Gettin straight to the point with no time to waste
The point is that this party needs to be rocked
Wioth drummin thumpin beats around the clock
>From odds to outspoken to opinionated
In need of a rhyme I will create it
The best is yet to come, with much much more
You got me rockin you with my rhymes galore
Now my rhymes won't stop, my rhymes won't quit
Just give me the mic and I rock it
On to the break of dawn
I will rock y'all to the early morn
Cause I'm the demonstrating, the dominating
Annihilator, brutalor, MC-hating
So all MC's must step on off
Cause I'm lettin you know who's the boss
Now Kid Ice, you know you're twice as nice
Why don't you get up on the mic and start to recite?
[ VERSE 3: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Cause they call me Kid Ice, the ladies' fire
When I enter a room, ladies fill we desire
Anytime I'm good, yes on the mic
I said the girls keep comin back every night
Cause I dress so fresh, my voice is clean
I can rock party people, yes even the Queen
In England, Germany, France and Japan
The ladies know that I'm the man
Who keep em from the kitchen just doin their dishes
Cause I have em in bed fulfillin their wishes
I got a degree in makin love
Yes I got it from my father just up above
I could take a girl from any man
With a twitch of my lips or wave of a hand
So to all you guys out there tonight
Grab your girl, hold her tight
Say treat her with respect and treat her right
Cause I might be in town for just one night
(Word)
(Do it)
(1-2-3-4-5-6 do it)
(We're here)
(We're back)

Deep down south, we love to party
Dance floors packed, hoes shakin' they bodies
70's music still rulin' the disco
>From South Beach to San Francisco
A late night fever, a sex crazed land
Wild-ass hoes to the one night stand
Swettin' the freaks with the tightest skirts
Talk about they ride, a 60s 'Vert
Listenin' to oldies bumpin' the sounds
Forget that shit, buy the underground
Underground station that ain't legit
Playin' them cuss-words, dropping that shit
Party from the club, to the streets
Hangin' on cars, solicitin' freaks
It ain't over, it's time to play
Don't stress ya'll, let's par-tyyy!

Verse 2:  Freak Nasty
I put my hand up on your hip
When I dip, you dip, we dip
So c'mon baby, just Pop That P'
And watch Freak Nasty Throw that D, yeah
Ain't nuthin' like a 2 live party
When them hoes freak everybody
Them other girls just bore me
But the 2 Live girls make Me So Horny
I had a hoe doin' S & M
Marquis had a hoe doin' her and him
Chinaman had 'em gettin' down low
And m' boy King T was bringin' three mo'
Come one come all if you can hang
But you gotta Move Somethin' and Do the Damn Thang
Clay D got the bottle and I got the blunt
2 Live, Freak Nasty, what's up!
Chorus
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
What'll know 'bout havin' a party?
Fall up in the club, the envy of everybody
You make the money, so spend it
Baller parkin' Benz's lookin' like millions
I'm in the back of the club gettin' blessed g-fresh
Drinkin' n' smokin' the best, and nothin' less
Champagne poppin', chicken heads flockin'
The DJ's rockin', got the whole house hoppin'
Let's make this night one to remember
If you fuckin' with me, you're fuckin' with a real nigga
You can jump in the 'Vert, baby, and ride out
I'll have you suckin' me up at the hide-out
Tell a bitch quick, I ain't beggin' nor buyin'
Get the fuck up out my face, who the fuck you tryin'?
It's a good time nigga, that's what I'm all about
Get the money get the pussy, get the map, I'm out

Put your legs up high, straight to the buck (Yeah!)

Some girls fuck and some girls cry (Yeah.)
Some girls suck and some girls lie
Triflin' hoes, it's you I salute (Yeah!)
'Cause a bitch is gonna fuck who she wants to (True dat!)
And if you're lookin' for love, you're outta place
'Cause you'll only get a fuck and some nut in your face!  (Yeah!)
Chorus
(A fuck is a fuck, NIGGA!  Yo, break this shit down, my nigga!)
Luke:
Now, the example of a fuck is just a fuck.  But let it be known that it's
onlya fuck.  See, some of y'all niggas get caught up in ... fuckin' a woman,
and thinkin' that's your woman, when it's just a fuck.  And some of y'all
ladies just get caught up with men, when they might be somebody else's
men ... that's just a fuck!  So a fuck is just a fuck!

So there you have it, you know what I'm sayin'!  2 Live is back in this

Verse 1: Brother Marquis
Lady Godiva was a freak
She rode buttnaked to the street
By doing this a hundred years ago,
It's all right for girls to be hoes
Romeo, where's Juliet?
She's out gettin' her pussy wet
My man Samson and that bitch Delilah,
She got mad 'cause Samson tried her
All the ass was for a little head
But she played it off like she was scared
Knowing all the time she was a freak
And couldn't wait to get in the sheets
There's a freak in every demon
They even had sex in the Garden of Eden
It's the devil's work, the Lord can't save ya
We got it bad, that freaky behavior
Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice
To some she's shy and to others she's wild
But to her daddy she's an innocent child
Not knowing what's happening when he's away
But like a bitch in heat, she's ready to play
She fucked five niggas 'till they all got sore
Then laughed in they face, and asked for more
She does what she wants, and no one can save her
A product of society with the freaky behavior
Verse 3: Brother Marquis
Hoe, you know you're my aphrodesiac
Before you suck my dick, can you pull the skin back?
You're a dog-ass bitch doing dirty deeds
If your period's on, then fall to your knees
Bitch, you belong in a sex asylum
Every trick in the book, your dog ass has tried 'em
Blame it on your mama, 'cause it's how she raised ya
I guess that explains your freaky behavior
Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice
She's also wild, but only she can stand it
Fuckin' all the boys and making 'em cum in a minute
The best dick sucker that could ever be found
Who'll suck your balls, then drink the cum
Up on the 'ave, she's more than a teaser
And to the boys, our own private skeezer
You can tell her daddy, but no one can save her
She does what she wants with her freaky behavior!

(During the breakdowns, we hear the Crew just hangin' out,
chit-chatting about their sexual encounters.  Most of their
words are inaudible.)
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
There's always one bitch in every town
Every time you see her, her panites are down
Always dressed fresh in the ladies' wear
She sports the weave instead of hair
Known to the boys as a real fly cutie
Tight-ass jeans to show that booty
When we met, I acted grinnin'
'Cause in my book, she was a queen
I felt that feelin', anticipation
Later came the stories of a reputation
She was burnin' since she was born
I fucked anyway, 'cause the bitch was ON!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
When we first met, I'll never forget
'Cause her lips were moist, a touch soft and wet
We danced, to a funky tune
And stared at each other in a smoke-filled room
I said, ""What's up?  Are you down with it?
Let's go to the crib so I can run up in it!""
So we left the club for this night full of fun
I'm out for a splak, 'cause I'm not the one
For no bullshit or love-silly games
Let's get butt-booty naked and do the wild thing
First she took off her panties, snatched off her bra
Out popped the biggest tits I ever saw
They were big enough to knock a man down
They were shaped like grapes, and my favorite shade of brown
My dick was hard, and she was hot like a heater
By the looks of her mouth, she was a dick-eater
I said, ""You raggedy bitch, don't play dumb!
Put my dick in your mouth and make this motherfucker cum!!""
Yeah!  This bitch was ON!!
Chorus
Verse 3
[BM]   The head was smokin', I had to call my friends
In the next ten minutes, all the boys were in
Dat was in the front and Lat was in the back
The pussy was poppin' like Cracker Jack!
[FKI]  She had to get paid; I put her in the trick
I gave her a penny for every inch of my dick
We kept on fuckin' 'till the early morn
[ALL]  THAT BITCH WAS ON!!!

That's right y'all, you heard it 'cause we said it
And if you can't read in the magazines,
You read about who?  You know the Crew!
Fresh outta Pac
And the first to put the bass on the 24-track
Some said it wouldn't work, some said it wouldn't last
In New York, they say that the tempo's too fast
You disregarded, but the albums got charted
We put 'em in the stores and millions habe bought it
An underground sound, not liked by radio
You hear it in the cars and at the dicso
On the airwaves, we misbehave
We're too bold, too rugged in our nasty ways
From dirty minds come dirty rhymes
We're not gonna beg for your time
You don't play it?  That's cool with me
But somehow, our bass still reaches the street
As long as we got it, you can get it

The name of the game is supply and demand
We supply the bass while you demand our jams
We could not wait to bring our bass to you
Because in this game, you lag, you lose
See, we serve our bass raw, straight up and not false
This is the kind you dance to, and not on 8-Ball
Plenty of bass, the beat, and the rhyme
That my homeboy Mr. Mixx carefully designed
Hittin' hard as hell, and always droppin'
Bass is the reason why you are rockin'
When you hear our songs, and you see our face
Put two and two together; we're the boys with the bass!

[BM]  When the party's over, we can get together,
Go to my house and fuck forever,
And do whatever comes to mind
Let me stick my dick in your behind
You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
Then suck my dick until I cum
Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
You're not used to people saying things like this

I only give compliments when they are due
Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest
I'll be gentle, baby, 'cause we can do this!
Verse 2
[BM]   Love is the key to end all your woes
You'll be my bitch, not a dirty hoe
Together as one we will be
I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
Then lick my ass up and down
Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss

Let's walk the beach in the moonlight

When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
Makin' love, holdin' you near

Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
Suck it, bitch, 'cause you can do this!

Listen and learn while I take you to school
You say you don't fuck on the first date?
Then fuck you, bitch!  I ain't gonna wait
'Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
I'll find another bitch to get it on
'Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  As you move your body, the shit you say
Will make any man want to stay
'Cause being with you is all I ask
And fucking you will be my task
My lonely nights will be filled with fun
No more clubs and sex on the run
Just suck this dick, while here I lay
You can do this, so c'mon, babe!

[BM]   Bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
Now you wanna start acting dumb
You wanna play cat and mouse
When I catch you, I'ma stick my dick in your mouth
Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
Just fuck me good until I skeet
Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
C'mon, baby, 'cause we can do this!

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Extra extra, hear all the bad news
About the wacky-wack MCs and the ones like you
Because I've done everything that you have tried
And I've been accepted where you've been denied
I'm the M-A-R, the Q-U-I-S
Here to run down a rhyme at your request
I'm the New York born, who's sharp as a thorn
I came here tonight just to get it on
So listen up close and listen up well
Cause the Brother Marquis has a story to tell
This is a story about an MC
Who got real brave and challenged me
He thought that he was bad, he thought he was tough
Until I, what, until I called his bluff
And as the battle began, his rhymes got weaker
You couldn't even hear his voice come out the speaker
And as he started to get ignored
The party people turned and walked off the floor
They did not applaud and they did not cheer
And homeboys just said ""Get the fuck outta here""
So as I cracked a smile and started to laugh
I could see the sucka duck muthafucka gettin mad
He had a frown on his face, he was hotter than fire
He wasn't competition but just a little biter
So, as he turned and walked away
With his head to the ground and nothing to say
Cause he was busted, disgusted, and couldn't be trusted
He tried to battle me and found self-DESTRUCTION

Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
I met this girl named Kisha, the daughter of a preacher
I met her in school and we did it on the bleachers
The kids were in gym as I went for a swim
I rocked her so good until she wanted it again
That was jet-set, so soft and wet
Now Kisha's on my tip, and that you can bet
Until one day I got caught in the act
With my girl named Melissa from a few days back
Kisha done called me up and asked me to explain
She said I played with her heart like it was a game
She said ""Why?"" I couldn't deny
She said ""Don't lie"" then she started to cry
But Kisha was YEARNIN to be DE-VIRGINED
She told her father, and he preached her a SERMON

(Hit it)
[ VERSE 1: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Coolin' in Miami one summer day
Drivin down the streets along the bay
My girls' hair's blowin' in the breeze
Her skin's gettin' tanned 'cause it's 90 degrees
I took her home and met the homeboys
Before gettin' bored we'll avoid the noid
Went to Opa Locka, jumped in Luke's jet
To the Bahamas and Mixx said, ""Bet""
We landed in Naussau, when walkin downtown
We met four females, all of were down
Went to the beach on Paradise Isle
We played water sports and had sex for a while
Before we knew it it was time to go
'cause the very next day we had a show
We'll let the people see that 2 Live is rulin'
(Now back to the crib where we'll be coolin')
[ VERSE 2: Brother Marquis ]
Coolin' with the posse, playin' it hard
Rollin' two deep as I drop the top
Beams from the sun light up the city
As I roll through sidin', sittin real pretty
It's a hot summer day and I feel good
So I turned up some music and hit the neighborhood
Spoke to the brothers, sweatin' the ladies
I bumped into my homeboy Ice in the Mercedes
Went up on the ave. where they hustle real hard
Skeezers on the side cold jockin' our cars
Someone called my name, so I yoked it quick
And kicked it to the girlies who was all on the tip
As nightfall came I was still out there
Havin' fun on the one, carefree without a care
You say it, we can play it, I'm here for the choosin'
Marquis is chillin' hard, coolin'
[ VERSE 3: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Livin' the life of the rich and famous
We never had it so good, so who can blame us?
Here's a toast to our success
Break out the Dom 'cause we owe it to ourselves
So let's find a hideaway in the Carribean
Sail the ocean like a long-shore seaman
Goin' to the Islands to have some fun
Hit the beach and take in a little sun
[ Brother Marquis ]
Feelin' the breezes of the cool winds blowin'
On a mission, not knowin' where I'm goin'
It's a free day, and I got free time
And I'm loving every minute of this life of mine
You see, the lady I choose must like to cool
In a freak's cut bikini by the pool
[ Fresh Kid Ice ]
Havin' good times, that's what we'll be doin'
Like millionaires, stone cold coolin'

An answer'an answer??? and my latest thrill is to bust my nuts in a bitch's mouth
CHORUS:
That Dick Almighty ?all'almighty, that Dick Almighty?..all'almighty?.that dick??????almighty
Dick Almighty's of no surprise'it'll fuck all the bitches
All shapes and size
She'll climb a mountain, even run the block
Just to kiss the head of this big black cock
He'll tear the pussy open cuz its satisfaction, the bitch won't leave its fatal attraction.
Dick so powerful she'll kneel and pray, awaiting her time hoping soon to slay
That dick?.will make a bitch cry, when fuckin a bitch that's tight inside
That dick ?.has got a spell on you, once it gets inside you'll act a fool
That dick?.will make a bitch act cute, suck my dick bitch and make it puke
Jump up on it, grab it like you want it?
If you could wear a dick'bitch, you would flaunt it
CHORUS
Bitches are the one's thinkin dicks get soft, they fuck one time and they got off
Thinkin its slick just to ride the dick, they'll make a nigga cum and then he'll quit?
But not the long one'I won't play that shit, put her ass in the buck and kill the clit
Its 15 inches long, eight inches thick'last name almighty first name is dick
That dick'is a mutha fucka, I cant be pussy whipped by a dick sucka
That dick'will drive a bitch crazy, bitches wanna fuck when your tired and lazy
That dick'sometimes costs you money, don't be blamed for a child that's not yours dummy.
That dick'is a greedy bitch's dinner?.I let a bitch feed before I go up in her
CHORUS
Bitches go crazy at the all night fuck, starting from the back then to the buck
Since a good dick is hard to find,  I kill that pussy then fuck your mind
Bitches like the dick just claim defeat, forget the salad just eat my meat
They pay big dollars cuz they don't dumb freaks, to spend time with the Dick the Almighty
That dick'will make ya cheat on yo man
Make you so freaky and hot in the ass
That dick'will make ya hurt yourself
When you don't have dick you'll finger fuck yourself
That dick?.is an awful thing but you bull-dykin bitches are fuckin up the game, rubbin belly to belly and skin to skin, fuckin like hell but aint no dick going in

My mama and your mama was talking little shit
My mama called your mama a bulldagging ass bitch
I know your sister, and the bitch ain't shit
She slayed me and all the boys
And even sucked our dicks
Jack and Jill went up the hill to have a little fun
Jack got mad, kicked Jill in the ass
Cause she couldn't make him cum
Mama Bear and Papa Bear went for a walk through the forest
Mama Bear asked Papa Bear could he eat her porridge
Papa Bear said 'shit bitch, you must think I'm sick
Just get down here, on your knees
And suck this bear-ass dick'
Abraham Lincoln was a good old man
He hopped out the window with his dick in his hand
Said 'excuse me ladies, I'm doing my duty
So pull down your pants and give me some boody'
[Fresh Kid Ice]
There's an old lady who lives in a shoe
Got a house full of kids don't know what to do
She sucked and fucked all the niggas around
When it's time to pay rent couldn't none be found
Little miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
With her legs gapped open wide
Up came a spider, looked up inside her
And said 'that pussy's wide'
Little Jack Horner sat in a corner
Fucking this cutie pie
Stuck in his thumb, made the bitch cum
Said 'hell of a nigga am I'
Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall
Cause a hoe on the ave. was sucking his balls
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put that fat motherfucker back together again

Hey wait, I got one, did this, I got one, check this out
The two dudes, dig this, the two dudes
Two dudes dressed like nuns, right

Little Red Riding Hood was on her way
To grandmother's house
But before she got there she met this man
That turned her hot ass out

Rupunzle, Rupunzle let down your hair
The dog's on my ass and getting near
The hair came loose and fell in a lake
Bitch check the weave that's in that lake

You dirty bitch, get that weave out!
Mix say, bitch get that weave out...

Well, it seems they're in the news again.  The 2 Live Crew has
started a dance craze that has basically taken the nation by
storm!  Here's a report.
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
There's a brand new dance and it's comin' to your town
It's done by the people who can really throw down
You don't need to be a queen or a jack of spades
It's done by the brothers with the hi-top fades
It doesn't matter if you're shy or wild
It's done by all, man or child
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it gets loose
Ladies, bend your back and also your knees
Shake your titties and let me squeeze
Then make a face like you wanna fart
Keep workin' them arms while doin' the Bart!
Verse 2
[Marquis]  Jitterbugs keep pumpin'!  Why you frontin'?
On the Bart, I'll keep the house jumpin'
Everybody follow me, do that dance, the B-A-R-T
Just step to the right and left
Do the Bart 'till you're out of breath
[Kid Ice]  It's brand new, the dance to do
The move for the 90's and it's comin' through
Girls, shake your titties and fall to your knees
Show that ass so I can squeeze
Then make the face like you wanna fart
Work them arms while doin' the Bart!
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
It's the Bart, y'all, the brand new dance
Fellas, grab your dick; girls, shake that ass
To do this dance you must wear Nike's
Girl, you need bikinis, and no sexy nighties
To do this dance, you can't act cute
Fellas, get upon that ass like you're knockin' the boots
In!  Out!  Up and down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're really gettin' down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're gonna get wet
Right Guard can't save you, 'cause you're bound to sweat
Fat girls, we ain't forgot about you
The Bart's the dance that you can even do
First you need a tight fade, a couple black medallions,
Some skiddo pants and then start dancin'
Unlike the Hammer, unlike the Humpty,
When you're doin' the Bart, you've gotta get funky!
[Kid Ice]  It's the dance of the 90s, motherfuckers act wild
Your Granny can do it, so you should try
It's not just a dance; it's a state of mind
The fellas need to hi-jump the girls' big behinds
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it get loose
[Marquis]  Jump up and down, but don't freak or hustle
When you're doin' the Bart, you use every muscle
Don't hurt yourself or exert yourself
You can do the Bart all by yourself
So why you sittin' there in your seat?
Just get on the floor and Bart to the beat!

Chorus (2x):  [Mr. Mixx]
I wanna do the damn thaaaaAAANG!
(Then do the damn thing!)
I wanna do the damn thaaaang!
(Then do the damn thing!)
Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
I'm a bad motherfucker bringin' hoes to their knees
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
Always on a mission 'cause I like to fuck
The way I hit the pussy is in the buck
Strokin' up and down, always takin' my time
Doin' it all till I make you mine
I rub your body with motion lotion
Lick you down like waves in the ocean
Do it till you're satisfied
Have you moan even though you're tired
I've fucked many bitches across the land
And no one slangs dick like the Chinaman
You ain't been fucked 'cause your pussy's froze
Many are called but few are chose
Bust them guts like it ain't no thing
So bitch stop frontin', let's do the damn thing!
Chorus
Verse 2:  [Brother Marquis]
Bitch, do you wanna swing with me?
Sex is the best with Brother Marquis
All hoes let my record show
All my bitches come back for more
It must be the way I throw my thang
It must be the way I spit my game
Look 'em in they eye, tell a quick lie
Kiss 'em and they cry, I don't know why
Game so strong, yet so convincin'
Give me a minute, I'm up in it
Talk 'em out they draws real cool
""Bitch, give it up smooth, you know the rules!""
True love ain't so hard to find
It's right between your legs and mine
None of my bitches, they never complain
They like the way I do the damn thing!
Chorus
Verse 3: [Brother Marquis]
I love it when a bitch be like pro-per
A hooche with a coochie that'll let me pop her
The ""Blac Vagina Finda""  Once I'm inside I must remind her
Pussy's deception, dick's a weapon
After I fuck, I'm steppin'
Damn right, ain't nothin' changed
That's the way I do my thang!
[Fresh Kid Ice]
Let me do it, like nothin' before
I don't need a friend, I need a whore
I need a bitch who'll fuck all night
Take plenty of dick, and the pussy's right
She'll keep me goin' till she gets me off
And bring me up, when I'm soft
Let's get together 'cause it ain't no thang
You and me, baby, doin' the damn thang!
Chorus
[Mr. Mixx]
Do the damn thang!
Hey, I'm doin' it, baby!
Now rub the damn thang!
Damn right, I'm rubbin' it, baby!
Kiss the damn thang!
Mmmmm-kissin'in' it, baby!
Now do the damn thang!
Then turn around, baby!
UHH!  UHH!  Now throw the damn thaaAANG!
Throw, throw it!
Throw, the damn thang, baby!

All the people on the left, just participate
And everybody o the right, we won't make you wait
And all the people inbetween, just shout and scream
And have a funky good time if you know what I mean
Because when we rhyme, we move people by the masses
When they say they'll pay we'll play when they ask us
Some say they don't know of us but that is a lie
Suckas try to play they games of Dis-and-Die
And don't you try to shake my hand or be my friend

To all you silly suckas wo try to abuse us:
When we get ignited you can't diffuse us
It'll be on radio and even TV
That we achieved a level where you wanna be
Now step off the pedestal, give us the mike
So we can rock the people the way you would like
Just do us a favor, don't be a jerk
'Cause all we wanna see is your body work!
{But all we want to see is yo' body work!}

[Kid Ice] There's a lesson to be taught, that's the one you should learn
You can't buy respect; it's what you earn

This story began five years ago
Took a funky idea and began to roll
By doing something that was never done
While getting paid, still having fun
Being explicit straight from the streets
Not forgettin' our roots to an up-tempo beat
Taking what they say just for granted
For us to give up, that's what they wanted
To do it all, we'd be taking shorts
'Cause at that time we were given no thought
To follow another; we didn't see it
We're the example for others to see
In the beginning all we had was a phone
And trust in each other was how we lived on
Word was bond, we relied on true
Faith in each other backed up by Luke
Chorus
[We are]
[Ghetto Style]
[Perched in the South]
[The king of the ghetto]
[The man, not a myth]
Verse 2: Brother Marquis
The journey was long, but we fought the struggle
We paid off in the end by the bundles
In the beginning, some were against us
But we proved them wrong, and made them envious
So we kept on writing, the public kept on buying
What we were making, they took a-likin'
We found the market, hit the target
We started the fire, but it's you who sparked it
We stayed independent, and we didn't sell out
We started off with no help from the White House
The plot was perfect, though we needed a gimmick
So we thought up this dance called Throw the Dizznick
In no time at all, things started growin'
Charts were showin' that sales were soarin'
Then all the talkin', all the squawkin',
They tried to take the name, but keep Skyy-walkin'
Chorus
Verse 3
[FKI] A black thing, from beginning to end
Brothers in the business and loyal friends
Steppin' on stages, movin' as one
For the money and for the fun
No matter how it goes, how bad it seems,
When once seem down, we all come clean
[BM] In unity, we all stand strong
We all step together, no man walks alone
No matter what, they can't stop us
They ain't doin' us just 'cause, when it's just us
Any circumstance we must overcome
Let's keep the dream alive, and all get some
And never mind those people with the negative vibe
And never mind the people with the evil eyes
'Cause they all flippin' somewhere out on a trip
'Cause they don't understand the man and the myth

I've been wanting to tell you this for a while
I like your fake blue eyes and your hoey style
So let's go for a walk through the park
You can suck my dick in the dark
And just do what I ask; bitch, bend over
Let me ride your backside like dogs do each other
I know that you're with it, so don't start frontin'
I don't wanna be your man; I wanna MOVE SOMETHIN'!

""You might as well give up the pussy.""
""Oh no!"")

Listen up, baby, you look real pretty
Let me pull up your shirt and suck your titties
Yes, pretty lady, I love you so
Since the time we met, my dick has grown
You had other men; now it's my chance
Give me some time to take off my pants

Just drop them draws, and let's MOVE SOMETHIN'!

""Now what the hell do you want??""
""I want to FUCK!"")
Verse 3: Brother Marquis
Let's rent a room at a fuck-motel
Then play this game called ""Ring the Sleigh Bells""
Put the ""Do not disturb"" sign on the door
And ride this dick 'till it gets sore
Then open your legs, put 'em in the buck
'Cause that's the way I like to fuck
It's real simple; it's not really nothin'
All you have to do is MOVE SOMETHIN'!

""Now let's find a motel so I can see how you fuck!""

Verse 4: Fresh Kid Ice
Look, baby doll, don't lie or front
You know what I need and I know what you want
Let's go to the beach, we'll lay in the sand
And I'll prove to you that I'm a real man
And the way it felt, it was real tight
It chilled my body and the feeling was right
It's all for love; it's you I've been wantin'
Just roll those hips and let's MOVE SOMETHIN'

""Turn over!  I'ma stick it in y'ass!  'No, it's gon' hurt!'
You'll get used to it.""
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Lady Godiva was a freak
She rode buttnaked to the street
By doing this a hundred years ago,
It's all right for girls to be hoes
Romeo, where's Juliet?
She's out gettin' her pussy wet
My man Samson and that bitch Delilah,
She got mad 'cause Samson tried her
All the ass was for a little head
But she played it off like she was scared
Knowing all the time she was a freak
And couldn't wait to get in the sheets
There's a freak in every demon
They even had sex in the Garden of Eden
It's the devil's work, the Lord can't save ya
We got it bad, that freaky behavior
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
To some she's shy and to others she's wild
But to her daddy she's an innocent child
Not knowing what's happening when he's away
But like a bitch in heat, she's ready to play
She fucked five niggas 'till they all got sore
Then laughed in they face, and asked for more
She does what she wants, and no one can save her
A product of society with the freaky behavior
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
Hoe, you know you're my aphrodesiac
Before you suck my dick, can you pull the skin back?
You're a dog-ass bitch doing dirty deeds
If your period's on, then fall to your knees
Bitch, you belong in a sex asylum
Every trick in the book, your dog ass has tried 'em
Blame it on your mama, 'cause it's how she raised ya
I guess that explains your freaky behavior
Verse 4:  Fresh Kid Ice
She's also wild, but only she can stand it
Fuckin' all the boys and making 'em cum in a minute
The best dick sucker that could ever be found
Who'll suck your balls, then drink the cum
Up on the 'ave, she's more than a teaser
And to the boys, our own private skeezer
You can tell her daddy, but no one can save her
She does what she wants with her freaky behavior!

(Mixx cuts ""Get Loose Now"" from ""It Takes Two"")
Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
People everywhere, just check this out
Say, something brand new that'll make you shout
For you, and you, and all to see
The dopest rhymes, said by me
Listin' these facts for all to know
How to rock a party, keep the crowd on the go
It starts with the beat, then comes the rhyme
The stance that's hard to keep you on time
We'll add a little scratch to give some flavor
So the mix'll be right for you to savor
There's only one way to move the crowd:
Bass level up high, volume level up loud
To do youre best, you gotta believe
And what you want, you'll soon achieve
It's who you know to get your juice
I started with rhymes and I get loose!
Chorus
Verse 2:  [Brother Marquis]
This is a section, some of a rehearsal
So sucker MC's don't take it personal
I don't mean to talk about you or put you down
But I get loose out the door and go and freestyle
You see, the point I'm trying to make comes out so clear
I be bustin' lyrics 'till I leave here
I don't claim to be the best; I'm funky, not fresh
I just want to get respected, with all the rest
You see, I come from down South, talk slick out my mouth
I went to New York and got kicked out
Because they don't like me; they just like us as a whole
'Cause the music we make (?) we got soul
So tell me the truth; it's monkey see monkey do
We cuss on a record; now you wanna cuss too
From Hi-top fades to jhericurl juice
Watch Marquis y'all, as I get loose!
Chorus
Verse 3: [Fresh Kid Ice]
Get on up, let me bust a rhyme
Something that happened ahead this time
I was coolin' out, doin' my work
Then suddenly, it went berserk
Marquis came in with a couple girls
All the boys went crazy, takin' off clothes
We all got naked, no time to front
Clear the desk, 'cause you know what I want
Grabbed one by the hair, threw her on the floor
Opened her thighs, and guess what I saw
A hell of a mess, oh, what a bush
In a couple of minutes I'll be there to push
And back and forth, the momentum goes
I keep on strokin' as I get on my toes
She kept on moanin' 'till she started to juice
I'm in control when I get loose!

Ghetto Style Dee-Jays!
{Don't touch that stereo!}
{Ghetto}  {Bass}
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
What's up, party people, we're back again
Bringin' you the message from some of our friends
They're the funkiest crew from the heart of the city
When the amps are on, they'll take no pity
'Cause Ghetto has the style that has the girls jockin'
When you talk about the system, all you say is ""Rockin'!""
Others hear the name, then scream out loud
'Cause they are known to move the crowd
When you hear the sound, they'll stop and wonder
Then gaze upon the speaker, the wall of thunder
Standin' on the ground, 3 stories high
The deepest bass and the real fresh high
So step off your throne; they're on the loose
The DJ's from Miami with all the juice
So consider yourself warned; they're back on the case:
It's Luke Skyywalker and the Ghetto Style Bass!
{Ghetto}  {Get up}
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
To some, ""Ghetto"" is a name; to others a tradition
In the city of boom, ther can never be an addition
Of any of the DJ's to rock the land
Like the ones from the city and the boys from Pac-Jam
Handsome Harry, you know the brother was strong
He ain't dared any man to get him wrong
L.A. Jay, this young brother doesn't play
He'll strong-arm any sucker who gets in his way
Baby Ced, Liberty City born and bred
Always known for the knowledge and sense of the head
Disco Gene, he's reunited with the team
He was gone for a while, but back in the swing of things
Amazing Chico, a king to his trade
Known as Bernie B. on 9-1-7 Bass
And G.I. Joe, who has the girls by the row
He always gets cased 'cause his game is gettin' slow
And last but not least, marvelous J.P.,
And we can't forget Cisco - we're glad you are free
So one day to your kids you will tell the story
Of how the Ghetto Style DJ's achieved their glory!
{Ghetto}  {Bass}
{Look out everybody, 'cause they're in the place,
It's Luke Skyywalker and the Ghetto Bass!}

Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Hangin' on the corner, lookin' real sporty
Coolin' with the fellas while downin' a 40
Nothing to do, just killin' time
Sittin' on my ride with my hand on my 9
Gettin' a buzz, feelin' kinda nice
Homie dropped a 20, so we shot some dice
We played for a while, 'till my luck was out
So the bitches walked by and my dick popped out
Rankin' on the bitches hanging in the street
It's feedin' time, so hoe, come eat
Nibble on this dick, make me just say please
You know how it's done, like a rat does cheese
The hoe started buggin', jumped in my face
Since the boys were stressin', I had to punch her in the face
Grabbed the weave, stuffed it in her mouth
Don't fuck with the Kid while I'm hangin' out!
(Interval:  Marquis talking.  Most of his words are indistinct.)
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Me and my nigga, rollin' hard
Hangin' out, the whole nine yards
I'm smokin' a fat one, takin' a 40 to the head
Watch out, fool, get shot dead
And bitches clownin', cryin' and all that
But yet, still, I keep my gat
Rollin' real hard in a six-tre ('63)
Motherfuckin' punk, step out my way
And all you fools in the game, you silly-ass lames
You can't fuck with me; I'm wild and not tame
Like a savage beast, I'm out on the street
So, motherfucker, what's up with that?  You wanted beef?
Punk, you got a problem?  I'll solve 'em!
I pulled his gat; his life cost him
So don't fuck with me while I'm around in the back
I'm always strapped when I'm hangin' out!

I remember back when, how the Kid got scarred
Beggin' for pussy; bitches actin' hard
I gots no play for the lack of papers
For the dope boys, I had the vapors
'Cause they got the hoes for the money they were stackin'
And all I had was dreams of rappin'
But a few months later the scenario changed
With a record and a video; now the Kid had game
They jumped over buildings, straight on the dick
It hit me so hard thinkin' I was it
They tripped me out, a sudden change of flavor
Hoes kissin' my ass wantin' to do me favors
But no matter how they tried to fuck with my pride
Ice Cold Productions won't slip or slide
'Cause when I was comin' up you was talkin' shit

I know what's happenin', don't think I'm dumb

Marquis is the man, and I'm on a mission
To make a lot of money is my main ambition
Fuck niggas, and fuck hoes too
The meal is made, so let's eat food
But some motherfuckers try to hold ya back
Some are white, but most are black
Goin' out like that makes me laugh
But they all can kiss the crack of my ass
And you know and I know who I'm talkin' about
Y'all need to shut your fuckin' mouth and step aside!
You better make way, 'cause here I come, motherfucker!

Verse 3:  Fresh Kid Ice
Steppin' to the light, and out the darkness
To relieve the pressure and all the madness
So here I come, a young man on the rise
Doin' what's right to stay alive
In a world of negativity and full of pain
We're brothers, down with each other for they own gain
So I keep on steppin', and keep on rappin'
Statyin' above the others, you know what's happenin'
For the better of myself, and not the fame
I try to make a livin' in this hip-hop game
If you wanna try, come and get some
Step out my way, 'cause here I come!

I will lick your funky emotion
Is this America?! Yeah!
Is this freedom?! No!
Is this Democracy?! No!
Is equallity?! No!
What do we want? Freedom!
Taking this shit into the effect mode
Expressing my feelings before I exploded
About the suffering passed on to a black man
By the money hungry seeking white man
Fucking up our streets with pollution
Then lock a nigga up for the solution
There they go now taking on the little man
Fuck wit the cartel or the white
Arrest musicains for the things they say
But can't find a crime after it got sprayed
This is America in God we trust
We won just this but
A dick is in the dust
I'm streotype so I fit the description
A nigga has the stigma for pushing or pimpin'
Police harrass me and public embarass me
They use brutallity without asking me
I'm mad cuz I was caught and reached for his license
Cops pulls the gun and cold ice
And I'm a victim of society I got societal ills
It's harder to pay bills than pop pills
They send a brother off to fight for your country
When ask for ours we get nothing
I look for work and get my feelings hurt
They got my back against the wall
And my dick is in the dirt
Lets talk about this man they call Nino Brown
The black man they call Nino brown
You know there's alot of Nino Browns in every city
In the United States of America
America had formed a Nino Brown in every city
Basicallly because we have no way out
Ah, Is that what America really wants us to think
That we have don't way out
Here's an example, You have never seen
A black man come into Miami with
pounds and pounds of marijuana pounds and pounds of cocaine
You have never seen a black man drop off
A kilo load of cocaine out of a plane
Yet it is still in our community everyday
And we're the ones going to jail for it
The system is designed to lead us to stray
So we turn to guns and drugs for our pay
It's the sign of the times
I gotta get mine all I live is a life of crime
I come up hard from the ran down ghetto
You talk your ass off but tell me what a nigga know
All I see is alot of neighborhood drama
Babies crying, I wonder where's the mama
C.O.D. got rushed to tramu
A dealer had to deal to make a fast buck
She was just a patient, What the fuck
His back's against the wall and his dick's in the dust

There's 8 million stories in every city
And Americans love to watch it on TV
There's gays, lesbians, stripper nymphos
Teenage prostitutes, husbands gone psycho
The haters hate it 'cause it's too hot for TV
But America rules, nasty as we wanna be
Always #1 across the land
So don't hate Jerry 'cause he's the man!
With more fight time than HBO
And even Don King should promote talk shows
It't the best thing in years to hit the TV
'Cause America's rowdy-rowdy like Master P
Players everywhere love a good talk show
'Cause the hoochies get naked like a 2 Live show
So always represent the American way:
Freedom of speech and always gettin' paid!

The ghetto got me caught up in some talk show shhhhh
Now I'm on TV to find that my girl was a trick
She did my main man, plus my own band
I had to take a stand and beat the trick bad
Two sisters, that were doin' the two brothers
Now they fight 'cause they was doin' each other
The girl posin' nude used to be a dude
Outcasted from the family, now they startin' a feud
The man cheatin' on his wife got caught last night
'Cause the girl he was kissin' was a transvestite
Got caught on TV where it's too late to fight
Now the whole world knows about his secret life
50-year-old mom, dressed him like a hoochie
The hoodrat pulls a gat on the groupie
Too hot for TV, too much for the movies
Some lady smacked Jerry, say what? Sue me!

Showin' the world how Americans feel
With home-grown topics and a final thought
They even got hoochies without their bras
Of all the talk shows he's the best by far ...
{Instrumental where there should be a verse}
So set your VCR's if you got to go,
'Cause you're living in America with the Springer show!
[Marquis] At the sound of the bell that goes Aw Hell!,
Another knock down, another video sale
All problems solved, all matters scarred

More hair-pullin', nail-bitin' and people fightin'

I bumped into her at the Coco Cabana
Down in Cuban town in little Havana
I asked her her name, she said Juanita
I just had to ask cuz I just had to meet her
I heard of fast girls but she's a speeder
She said she was hungry and told me to feed her
So I got an expresso and a hot burrito
You look so sweet you fine senorita

It's a black thing baby so you know it's sweeter
Okay Juanita now I must be your guy

Black girls white girls even Puerto Ricans
But the Mexicans and Cubans are all so freakin'
I like 'em in dresses with big 'ole chesses
I also like the style and the way she impresses
The fragrance of her perfume smells like roses
She's guarenteed to turn heads whenever she poses
She lives in Miami and of Latin descent
And being with her is how my time should be spent
I met her in the berries on a Friday night
Dressed in a soft silky dress colour virgin white
I said ""hey pretty lady, just suck on my finger
And tonight you're the one to Mamalopenga""

Ah.. Just a minute, erm,
this is a little to controversial, and I don`t think..  erm,
We are going to be up and here comes that black
Watch yourself, he is kind of smart, you know...
Verse 1:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
This story began five years ago
Took a funky idea and began to roll
By doing something that was never done
While getting paid, still having fun
Being explicit straight from the streets
Not forgettin' our roots to an up-tempo beat
Taking what they say just for granted
For us to give up, that's what they wanted
To do it all, we'd be taking shorts
'Cause at that time we were given no thought
To follow another; we didn't see it
We're the example for others to see
In the beginning all we had was a phone
And trust in each other was how we lived on
Word was bond, we relied on true
Faith in each other backed up by Luke
Chorus:
We are
Ghetto Style
Perched in the South
The king of the ghetto
The man, not a myth
Verse 2:  [Brother Marquis]
The journey was long, but we fought the struggle
We paid off in the end by the bundles
In the beginning, some were against us
But we proved them wrong, and made them envious
So we kept on writing, the public kept on buying
What we were making, they took a-likin'
We found the market, hit the target
We started the fire, but it's you who sparked it
We stayed independent, and we didn't sell out
We started off with no help from the White House
The plot was perfect, though we needed a gimmick
So we thought up this dance called Throw the Dizznick
In no time at all, things started growin'
Charts were showin' that sales were soarin'
Then all the talkin', all the squawkin',
They tried to take the name, but keep Skyy-walkin'
Chorus
Verse 3: [Fresh Kid Ice]
A black thing, from beginning to end
Brothers in the business and loyal friends
Steppin' on stages, movin' as one
For the money and for the fun
No matter how it goes, how bad it seems,
When once seem down, we all come clean
[Brother Marquis]
In unity, we all stand strong
We all step together,
no man walks alone
No matter what, they can't stop us
They ain't doin' us just 'cause, when it's just us
Any circumstance we must overcome
Let's keep the dream alive, and all get some
And never mind those people with the negative vibes
And never mind the people with the evil eyes
'Cause they all flippin' somewhere out on a trip
'Cause they don't understand the man and the myth

I get all her money and, a-then I diss her
On Tuesday there's Sareesa, she's my homeroom teacher
She said, ""After school, I would love to meet you!""
I said ""Bet!"" with no regret
Because a night with her was one I wouldn't forget
So then I told all my homies and they all called me phony
And said I was kickin' a bunch of that baloney
But they soon found out, and now they all believe
'Cause every Tuesday after school, me and her would leave
My seven bizzos...(2x)
Seven days, seven ways, that's too much...
My seven bizzos...
On Wednesday there's Wanda, who looks like Jane Fonda
She said she likes bikes, so I put her on my Honda
I took her to the park, where it was pitch dark
She done what I asked right from the start
She got naked, then my dick got erected
Before I rocked her pussy, I had to check it
But when we're in school, she tries to play it cool
'Cause she doesn't want her rich friends to know the truth
But me and her both know all the facts
She's in love with the brother from the ghetto, who is black

Seven days, seven ways, that's too much...

On Thursday there's Trina, her perfume lingers

On Friday there's Frances, who likes to take chances
When her husband's at work, she does me dirty dances
She's my own private skeezer, she's not a dick-teaser
She knows what I like, and that's to please her
On Saturday there's Susie, who likes my jacuzzi
She steps in naked with her bare-ass booty
She takes a drink, then her head starts to sink
She slobs on Bob while I play with the pink
My seven bizzos...(2x)
Seven days, seven ways, too much...
My seven bizzos...
On Sunday there's Connie, who fucks with slick Ronnie
She's a tricky-dick bitch who's out for his money
She's always schemin' and hot like a demon
I thought I came in her mouth, but I was only peein'
Now all these hoes belong to one player
A hard dick brother and a pussy surveyor
Now y'all ain't heard?  You better go ask your mother
That your sister's being dicked by Marquis, your brother

Seven days, seven ways, too much...

Smoke-filled stages, bitches in cages
Guards at the door, armed with gauges
As they dance and I get hot,
Keep throwin' that pussy!  Don't stop!
[BM]   I like the way you lick the champagne glass
It makes me wanna stick my dick in your ass
So come on, baby, and pop it quick
I fall in love when you suck my dick
Bitch, you don't know?  You ain't heard?
Fuckin' with me, you're gonna get served
See, none of my bitches, they never complain
So come on, baby, and pop that thang!
Chorus
Luke:
Janet J, pop, that pus-sy!
Bu-bles, pop, that pus-sy!
Sandra P, pop, that pus-sy!
Ma-donna, pop that stinky smelly pussy, baby!
(Mixx scratches ""Work this motherfucker!""  ""Shit, this good!""  ""Woo hoo!"")

BREAKDOWN!!

Sweeter than honey, sugar and spice (Right.)
Told her my name was Brother Marquis
You know my reputation, hoe, I'm just a freak
She said, Marquis, I know your game
Heard about the way you throw that thang
I said, yo, baby girl, I'ma tell you no lies (What?)
'Cause all I wanna do is uh, get ya high,
And uh, lay ya down and do the body rock
She said come on, and we got in the car
Took a little trip to a fancy bar (What?)
Got some gin, some juice, some coke

There's only one way to have a good time

RIGHT It's the way to give her more than she wants
Like the doggystyle, you get all the cunt
'Cause all men try real hard to do it
WRONG To have her walk in front and we try to abuse it

We don't stop
Huh
[ VERSE 1 ]
A revolution of mass confusion, brothers killin each other
Robbin their mother, father, sister and brother
They don't wanna get a job, or go to school
They think it's cool, but they're playin the fool
It's now 1984, five hundred years later
We're dominating both sides of the Aequator
In sports, music, and makin love
But yet we still have trouble rising above
It's said that in the later days
People shall be movin in different ways
There'll be many false prophets, devils in disguise
Performin illusions before your very eyes
Some have eyes to see, and ears to hear
But they cannot utilize them because of fear
You have sell-out brothers who will sell their heart
For fame and fortune or to get a head start
But in the long run they will see
That they are nothin else but victims of prophecy
Time is running short, the world is in damnation
Refuse to follow the laws of creation
You can not all be Jesus Christ
But you still can make some sacrifice
If not for anyone for yourself
Cause you have nothin to prove to anyone else
We don't longer have a sheperd now, we're lost sheep
Have to open your eyes, you can't afford to sleep
And a major factor is jealousy
Which stops us from obtainin the unity
Come on
You don't stop
[ VERSE 2 ]
Times are hard, and people are chillin
You can't get a job, but you know you're willin
So you go down to the unemployment line
And the man throws you out on your behind
Then you find some transportation, and you go back home
And find your wife cryin on the telephone
The police called to say that your job is ill
She tried to o.d. on a bottle of pills
Now you're mad as hell, and can't take it no more
So you grab your gun and walk out the door
You find another brother and you take their check
And deep down inside you know you're riskin your neck
How do you know they don't have a knife?
But you have your gun, so then you take their life
Now your pocket is full, but can't you see
That your soul will burn in hell for eternity?
See, I remember back in Brooklyn, when I was a child
Actin wild, cause that was the stlye
But as I grew older, I learned the deal
Because my old lady told me, ""Son, be for real
You have a chance to be an architect or scientist
So why do you choose to be like this?""
You  have to get yourself together before it's too late
It's up to you to be a bum or someone great
We all have it in us, and that is why
They tell us lies to cover our eyes
So we are not able to see the light
And differentiate wrong from right
You see, the road to vanity is filled with flowers
You better be careful of its hypnotic powers
While the road to truth is long and full if distress
But if you make it through, you're truly the best
Come on

Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-y

In the club on the late night, feelin right
Lookin tryin to spot somethin real nice
Lookin for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home

She can be 18 (18) wit an attitude

I peep something comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey)
Sayin she was peepin and I dig the last video
So when Nelly, can we go; how could I tell her no?

And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you boo from way over there

Running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm gettin pages out of New Jersey, from Courtney B.

And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Payin cash; first class - sittin next to Vanna White

And I'm yellin, ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchu?!) you for real?!
Hey yo, now that I'm a fly guy, and I fly high

But yo it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should - fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggaz, wishin you was niggaz
Poppin like we drug dealers, simply cause she butt-naked

Hot dick in a cock, smokin' head and them blue balls
The finest thing hoein', not like I ain't knowin'

She'll turn a trick and suck a nigga-dick
And don't want a nigga to nut too quick

Don't fall in love when the pussy's thrown at ya

Can I skeet in your mouth?
Do you like it like that?
(woman:  Yess!)
Taste my skeet, don't it taste so sweet?
For my skeet you are a freak
I skeet off twice and then I'm done
I have to save some skeet for the next one, hon
All you have to do is believe
And the skeet will set you free
Chorus
Verse 3:
Skeetin' is for the young and old
But it's best to skeet in a hoe
Before I go out and skeet a bitch
I always take my skeetin' kick
I like to skeet in big ol' butts
It makes me skeet off big ol' nuts
You can say that I'm a nympho
Skeet in your mouth, then skeet your temple
I skeet best on a one-night stand
Brother Marquis is a skeeta man!
You suck slow and I fuck fast
Don't get mad if the skeet don't last
It ain't love, it must be lust
In the skeet you must trust
All you got to do is believe
And the skeet will set you free
Chorus
Jerk-jerk-jerk-jerk it off babyyy! (4x)

Umph
So funky!
Nasty!
Hey!
Verse 1:  [Brother Marquis]
I'm Nasty As I Wanna Be
I express myself so vulgarly
Obscene, or whatever you wanna call it
That's why some suckas wanna stall it
Some people worry about the wrong thing
But why worry about what we're sayin'?
'Cause we're gonna do what we wanna do,
And if y'all don't like it, well then fuck you too!
People don't know unless you tell them so
But it was cool when we were just in the ghetto
We did ask you to publicize us,
But it was you who created the fuss
And blew the whole thing out of proportion
You should worry about your topics like abortion
So I fiend for the funk like a dope-fiend junky
Fuck you all, and let us get So Funky!
Verse 2:  [Fresh Kid Ice]
Singin' this song, movin' along
Provin' to the suckas that I keep gettin'
Stronger than what ya been hearin'
Kid Ice is on the set, so suckas stop sweatin'
I kick it funky to show my courage
When schoolin' others, I kick the knowledge
For those who hate me, I pray you'll miss me
If you find out you had dissed me
I'll treat you like a child and smack ya head
Feed you dick, put you to bed
Look you in the eye and know you're fessin'
Make you take notes of the lesson
The rhythm is something I cannot hide
A feelin' that I feel, deep inside
So talk about me while I make my money
Kid Ice is known to be So Funky!
Verse 3:  [Brother Marquis]
Some say I'm crazy and I got problems
An evaluation might help solve 'em
The funky-mack-nasty, filthy-mack-funky
Stankin' (?), the wino junkyMentally scarred, always barred
Slightly deranged, a half-way retard
Goin' off insanely, tryin' to retain me
Tried to capture my rapture, but couldn't contain me
I put 'em in shambles, makin' examples
'Cause once I get started, I'm hard to handle
You can't keep me back, you can't forget that
I heard the chit-chat; you said that I'm wack
But anyway, that's okay
I try not to hear what the niggas say
So I just fiend for the funk like a dope-fiend junky
Excuse me y'all, and let me get So Funky!

Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
I like getting head, 'cause it's so convenient (Huh.)
You can do it any time; you don't have to beat it!
You can get it in the car, or even in the park (Yeah!)
But most head-hunters go out after dark (True.)
There's nothing like a pretty hoe on her knees
Suckin' my D (Yeaaah.) and lickin' my B's
We don't have to take our clothes off to bust a nut
When I pull out my dick, BIIIITCH, pucker up!
And gimme some!
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Coolin' in a club on a Saturday night
Gettin' fucked up with the boys and feelin' all right (Yeah!)
When I saw this bitch who had to be a winner
And the only thing on my mind was to run up in her
So I got her kind of tipsy with some Sex On The Beach
Then the bitch got hot and she wanted to eat
So, for me to get over, took her straight to the bed (What?)
She got on her knees and gave some good hot head! (Yeah!)
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
Hot head hoes, some white some niggeroes
But I like the ones who suck toes and assholes
With tongues like razors that cut when she licks (Ooh!)
How can I fuck you with a skinless dick? (ha ha ha ha ...)
You take pride in suckin' a good dick
And after I nut, bitch, you better not spit (ha ha ha ha ...)
You're a dirt dobbler, a goop gobbler
You'll fuck Satan for the righteous dollar
So gimme some! (Gimme some!)

Hell no!!

Verse 1:  [Brother Marquis]
I don't give my riches to the bitches!
Shake-dancin' ain't nothin' but trickin'
Ten dollars, too much to give 'em
I done had my two-drink minnimum
I watch from a distance so I can
see,Now Charles kickin' me out the VIP?
Bitches callin' me cheap
While they trick as they dancin' in minks
Hoe, you must be crazy
I know it's your job, but I ain't trickin' miss daisy
I want a quick feel, a cheap thrill -
But I ain't payin' no pussy bills!
If you got mouths to feed,
Bitch, you better recognize a dick in need
'Cause I'm a 3-piece nigga, bitch, I don't play
I want the pussy, a place to stay, but I don't pay!
Uhh!!  Uhh!!  Now throw that pussy!!

Verse 2: [Fresh Kid Ice]
Booty clubs where niggas go
Spendin' flow for stripper hoes
And table-tops cost five dollars
If the hoe ain't cute, don't even bother
Bitch, come clean from beginnin'
Drop them strings and skin to win
She gotta show pink to get paid
And I don't want a hoe who's always afraid
I'll flip that hoe like a script
'Cause for all that flow, niggas might trip
'Cause pussy's a man's best friend
And she gotta keep shakin' 'till the record ends

Hell naw!
Not to see YO' funky ass!
You wanna dance?
Don't sewat it!
If I fuck for free, then you can dance on credit
Trick-ass niggas just spoil 'em
Payin' 'em more than the club that employs 'em
Checkin' that booty movin'
To me it's just a form of prostitution
Niggas be wreckin' theyself,
Thinkin' they got that bitch to theyself?
Well I sit back and relax
But tell bitches with babies

You can pop that pussy tax-free,
But you won't get shit from me!
Uhh!!  Uhh!!  Now throw that pussy!!

When your mama was a hoe, did she get dough?
Don't ask me for a dance; I don't need one
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one

They can't fade us 'cause we two of the greatest
Back out to let 'em have it, fake fucks and faggots
Bow down in the presence of players and kiss the karats

How you gonna step to me, kid, you grew up off me

So many buses in Versace I don't wear it no more
Called my nigga in Miami, ""Marquis, wussup?""

Mirrors on the floor so I can see it all

And raise that ass so I'll splak it all!

And you're looking for a spot where the price is right
You can come on in for an hour or two
But just make sure you bring a rubber with you!
[FKI]  When you're with a hoe and you wanna get freaky
This is the spot when you're low on money
Pick her ass up when it's after dawn,

The Surgeon General says wear a condom
But you can catch AIDS nowadays from slobbin',
Gynecology, and urology
If I'm positive, too late for an apology
Take extreme measure for sexual pleasure
Protect your jewels; it's what you treasure
Use precaution to prevent abortion
All we need is another life lost in
The system that's designed to hold us back
Get off the heroin and the crack!
All this shit is so confusing
You can't even have a blood transfusion
For the fear of infected plasma
You won't be the first, nor the last one
Getting pussy's like death wish two
You've got to know who's fuckin' who!
Chorus (4x): Edsel Harris
Who's fuckin' who?
Verse 2: Fresh Kid Ice
Living in a world where no one has trust
A lack of understanding, filled with lust
Where diseases are common, inflicting much pain
Gonorrhea and AIDS, too many to name
Sex is alive in both young and old
But a lack of education leaves us in the cold
There may be a cycle that we failed to mention
But people are fuckin' without protection
'Cause Jim fucks Ann, then fucks Susie
Then runs across town to go fuck Stevie
Thinking he's a player, trying to get over
But all he's doing, transmitting to another
If you've gotta fuck, don't fuck yourself
Use protection for others, if not yourself
'Cause people are fuckin', and this is true
What you don't know is who's fuckin' who
Chorus
Verse 3:
[Marquis]
Junkies use the intravenous
Then fuck each other? I can't see this
Sex and drugs, you know they don't mix
Especially when a bitch turns tricks for a fix
So be careful, 'cause that shit's out there
It's a 4-letter word that you should fear
So please choose a rubber before you choose your lover
Don't be a fool and forget, my brother!
[Kid Ice]
The 1990's, the decade of disease
It seems like we're trying to kill our own kind
By fuckin' each other with out protection
Just fuckin' ... and lack of selection
'Cause sex is alive in both young and old
So get educated; you're not too old
'Cause people are fuckin', and this is true
What we don't know is who's fuckin' who
Chorus
Outro: Mr. Mixx
The truth of the matter is, you gotta give yourself the benefit of the
doubt, you know what I'm sayin'? Don't just screw somebody just
because you feel you know 'em, you know? As for me, myself,
Mr. Mixx, Marquis, Luke, Kid Ice, 2 Live is outta here, you know
what I'm sayin'? Stay safe, always use a condom, you know what
I'm sayin', and everything'll be straight. Peace!

I'm sittin' by the pool, thinkin' 'bout some women
Wishin' that we all could be swimmin'
Then the Poison Clan bought some tricks
Couldn't find Luke, Marquis or Mixx
Now I'm drinkin' champagne and eatin' hors d'ourves
Talkin' to the ladies with the sexy curves
I opened a bottle of Mo'
The phone rang  Hello?
Now this is how we do it
They rushed to crib before I knew it
The Crew don't know how to ill
But everyone knows we like to chill
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
It's hot, I dropped the top to feel the breeze
Rollin' in the jeep to the APT's (apartments)
To get this girl so we could go for a ride
Rollin' down the 'ave but I can't decide
Shoud we go to the beach or just chill?
Today I lost a hundred-dollar bill, but still
I'm bankin', I can't wait to see Stacey
It's gettin' hot, so I turned on the A/C
I seen this girl in a tight-fittin' mini
She looks kinda good but she's a little skinny
So I kept on rollin'; I'm changin' my plan:
When I get Stacey, I'll check out the Ice-man!
I picked her up, she said, ""Where we goin'?""
""It's a surprise; I don't want you knowin'.""
""Will I like it?""  ""Of course you will,
'Cause you know that I know all the places to chill.""
Verse 3:
[BM]        I went to the door, then I knocked
When he answered, I was shocked
It looked like a party, plenty girls were there
But Stacey was with me, but I still had to stare
I went inside, and of course, you know
I grabbed some girls and a bottle of Mo'
I'm the Brother Marquis and it's time to get ill
Everybody knows that's how I chill
[FKI]       About that time, I was gettin' dizzy
'Cause it was time to get busy
I told the girl what Luke said
Then rushed to the room with the waterbed
Then everyone did the same
Later that night, Ghetto came
Then everyone got a thrill

(During the breakdowns, we hear the Crew just hangin' out,
chit-chatting about their sexual encounters. Most of their
words are inaudible.)
Verse 1: Fresh Kid Ice
There's always one bitch in every town
Every time you see her, her panites are down
Always dressed fresh in the ladies' wear
She sports the weave instead of hair
Known to the boys as a real fly cutie
Tight-ass jeans to show that booty
When we met, I acted grinnin'
'Cause in my book, she was a queen
I felt that feelin', anticipation
Later came the stories of a reputation
She was burnin' since she was born
I fucked anyway, 'cause the bitch was ON!
Chorus
Verse 2: Brother Marquis
When we first met, I'll never forget
'Cause her lips were moist, a touch soft and wet
We danced, to a funky tune
And stared at each other in a smoke-filled room
I said, ""What's up? Are you down with it?
Let's go to the crib so I can run up in it!""
So we left the club for this night full of fun
I'm out for a splak, 'cause I'm not the one
For no bullshit or love-silly games
Let's get butt-booty naked and do the wild thing
First she took off her panties, snatched off her bra
Out popped the biggest tits I ever saw
They were big enough to knock a man down
They were shaped like grapes, and my favorite shade of brown
My dick was hard, and she was hot like a heater
By the looks of her mouth, she was a dick-eater
I said, ""You raggedy bitch, don't play dumb!
Put my dick in your mouth and make this motherfucker cum!!""
Yeah! This bitch was ON!!
Chorus
Verse 3
[BM] The head was smokin', I had to call my friends
In the next ten minutes, all the boys were in
Dat was in the front and Lat was in the back
The pussy was poppin' like Cracker Jack!
[FKI] She had to get paid; I put her in the trick
I gave her a penny for every inch of my dick
We kept on fuckin' 'till the early morn
[ALL] THAT BITCH WAS ON!!!

There's 8 million stories in every city
And Americans love to watch it on TV
There's gays, lesbians, stripper nymphos
Teenage prostitutes, husbands gone psycho
The haters hate it 'cause it's too hot for TV
But America rules, nasty as we wanna be
Always #1 across the land
So don't hate Jerry 'cause he's the man!
With more fight time than HBO
And even Don King should promote talk shows
It't the best thing in years to hit the TV

Players everywhere love a good talk show
'Cause the hoochies get naked like a 2 Live show
So always represent the American way:
Freedom of speech and always gettin' paid!

Now I'm on TV to find that my girl was a trick
She did my main man, plus my own band
I had to take a stand and beat the trick bad
Two sisters, that were doin' the two brothers
Now they fight 'cause they was doin' each other
The girl posin' nude used to be a dude
Outcasted from the family, now they startin' a feud
The man cheatin' on his wife got caught last night
'Cause the girl he was kissin' was a transvestite
Got caught on TV where it's too late to fight
Now the whole world knows about his secret life
50-year-old mom, dressed him like a hoochie
The hoodrat pulls a gat on the groupie
Too hot for TV, too much for the movies
Some lady smacked Jerry, say what? Sue me!

[99 years.]
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Talk about, why?  Spreadin' rumors, tellin' lies
I'm real sensitive to the fact
Of why must you go out like that
You can't say nothin' positive
All I get are negative responses
They say it's hard to keep a good man down
But it's not hard to have one up off the ground
He said, she said, this-n-that
But who's tellin' the truth?  It ain't like that
I knew somethin' was wrong, I knew it all along
But nobody told me what was goin' on
So just STOP ... all this disrespect
'Cause now is the time for me to put you in check
They say the truth hurts, but don't get mad at me
I'm talkin' to those who got larceny
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Larceny, meaning bein' jealous-hearted
Over little or nothin', it can get started
For example, a man wants to get ahead
Others wish he failed and rather see him dead
Always puttin' obstacles in your path
It becomes a problem you shouldn't have
It's like a disease spreadin' faster than AIDS
The word is out, they misspelled your name
People look at you a little strange
You gain more foes as your lifestyle change'
They want what you got, that's the dollars that you clock
To you it's petty but to them it's a lot
Material things they couldn't retain
Still hopin' your loss will be their gain
Yet we strive to stay alive and live carefree
Others still have that larceny
Verse 3
(Kid Ice) You'll shake my hand, pretend to be my friend
And behind my back, wish it all would end
People mention my name, you'll frown your face
Hopin' in your dreams you'll take my place
The things that I own you wish you had
Every time I do good it makes you mad
You're not a friend to me, just an enemy
A sucker that rhymes, a wanna be
(Marquis) You wanna be like me, only in your dreams
You wanna be down, but you gotta come clean
Rockin' boomin' beats on every cut
2 Live's in effect, why you sweatin' us?
Wishin' you had all the money I've made
And all the females that I've slayed
You hate me, boy, now ain't that a pity
You ain't got the vapors, you got larceny

Its Time To Play Ping Pong Come Grab This Paddle Girl
Since I Done Met ya, Ya Mind Up In Another World
I Heard You In Tha Bathroom You Had To Call Your Girl
So I Called Webbie,
'Webbie She Was Fire, Ha Body Had No Marks Like Some Brand New Tires'
She Woke Up In My Arms I Took Her To Tha Mall
I Spent A G On Her On Some Glasses And Showed Her How I Ball
Girl You Can Have It All, I Aint Got No Wife
Yea I Got A Baby Momma Let That Go,
Aight So Whats The Deal Or The Night? We Fucking Or What?
Im Still Having Wet Dreams Of Her Catching A Nut
She Make My Pressure Go Up When She Get On Top Of Me
She Make A Nigga Skeet Then Go Fix Me Something To Eat.
[Course:]
Now Im Gonna Keep It Real I Need Somebody
To Feel My Pain And Really Know How To Treat Somebody
I Need A Women With A Mind She Can Put It On My Mind
Candle Light Dinner, While We Drinking Expensive Wine
She Aint Got To Be A Dime But Got To Be A Nine
She Aint Got To Come Right Then But She Always Right On Time Huh Bra
She Took That Ride To Tha Pin Every Sunday And
Every Monday The commissary It Was Comin Look
Now Thats Yo Woman
Them Other Hoes They Was Jocking On Them 24's
Now You Cant Even Get A Letter, Ain't This World Cold
Yo Girl Know When You Was Cheating You Cant Hide From Her
Plus She Care For Yo Child Like It Came Out Of Her
Im Gone Tell You Like It Is They Got Some Real women
Who Ready To Settle Down Is You Ready Nigga...

Get in ya brain teach ya game need cha pain and show ya thangs
Sit cha on some leather seats while blowin green and switchin lanes
Girl stop playin let me beat it out the frame
She 5 foot 7 a hundred and thirty nine pounds
36 24 38 pretty fine brown bad lil broad
I aint seen her in a minute since the all-star games and im still tryin to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell thangs
He caught a fed case and her aint leave her no change
She sold all his jewls she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club strippin for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to the split
Pussy poppin on the handstand man she the shit
Still lookin tight though still built right though
Run my game right and after the club she might go
Back to the telly with me shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
Got Lil Webbie with me and he aint hatin
We some playas in this bitch so baby stop ya hesitating
Now I can tell by yo size that that pussy is fire
So Im here and willin to give you whateva require
For you to lay down on yo back and then open yo thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have ya rolling ya eyes
You a big fine horse to have no choice but to just try it
Look like its worth a couple of g's but aint some shit that i'll buy
Let me whisper in yo ear again I aint gone lie
I might share a lil mel just dont tell nobody
Look you know you want it girl dont act like you dont want it girl you want it just as bad as i do
But check this out you go be wishing that u been gave me yo numba by the time I finish rumbling with you

Baby momma baby momma
I'm tired of you
I'm to the point where I wanna fire you
You play the games that a child will do
When you need to do the things that a mama do
Baby momma baby momma
You stressin me (you stressin me girl)
Cause I ain't rich you think less of me (you think less of me)
And we ain't gotta take the test to see
You need to change yo ways so you can see the best of me
Baby momma baby momma
You lied to me (you lied)
A good man I tried to be (I tried)
You do me wrong even the blind can see
That's why I got another woman on the side of me
And she gon love me better (yea)
Fuck me better warm me up up in the coldest weather
She bout whatever you heard me
Baby momma baby momma I trusted you
It was so good I left it in when I made love to you
[Chorus]
I'm askin
Why you cryin girl?
Why you be lyin girl?
Why you won't shine girl?
On the stretch you know it's mine girl
Im askin
Why you have a baby?
Just to drive me crazy?
Why you be actin shady?
When you posed to be my lady
[Verse]
Baby momma baby momma
Thought you love me hoe? (thought you love me hoe)
But you won't put a child on child support
And you don't even want my child to know
That it ain't daddy it's his mama who wildin' tho
Baby momma baby momma
You jealous of me
You don't even want the fellas wit me (my niggaz)
And you keep on telling me
To slow my role but behind you I'm catchin' felonies
Baby momma baby momma
Where the love done went? (where the luv done went)
Don't wanna leave you cuz I love ya scent (ya smell)
The names I call you ain't really meant
But I'm tired of all these fightin's and arguments
Besides we grown not no mo teenagers
So you can stop playin them games tryna check my pager
You need to get ya mind right if not I'll see you later
You posed to take my side but you listen to the hatas (damn)

Why you cryin girl?
Why you be lyin girl?

Just to drive me crazy?
Why you be actin shady?
When you posed to be my lady
[Verse]
Baby momma baby momma
You hurted me
Me and you know you deserted me (why?)
I ain't gon lie feel like you murdered me
Cause you the only girl who ever hold work for me
Baby momma baby momma
You a possum now (you sneaky)
I heard you ridin through the bottom now (for what)
I'm tryna get back on my team
Cause you heard I had a major plug on prementhazime bitch please
Baby momma look what I did for you (look what I did)
I took you places that you never knew (you ain't even know that)
I bought you any kind of tennis shoe
If I thought I wouldn't gon make it I'll finish you (blaw)
Baby momma you missin me (I know that)
I know you miss how you was kissin me (fa sho)
It's sad to say that you a friend of me
But just remember can't nobody lay that dick like me

Don't run behind me, when ya find me
You gone regret you missed

Thug shit up in ninas, label Boosie a menace
God please forgive my sins, niggaz try'n take my ends

[Verse:]
I'm turnin' into Mr. telephone man
Girl, you know I miss ya
So many miles away
And I can't kiss ya
Look but I remember everything
The concert, the room
The shit you whispered in my ear when I had you
Now my Jacksonville chick
She an indo shopper
She like to smoke purple
And chill wit her partners
When I come in town, she cook for me
Know she lookin good for me
Momma white, daddy black
So that ass supa phat
My uptown chick
We still be flirtin
When I see her
She remind me of how I broke her virgin
Think I still drive her crazy
Cuz she still wanna date me
Got a man and a baby
Do ya thang, I ain't hatin'
Now my Michigan chick
She was too damn fine
Her pussy stay wet all the time
One of the best to ever ride me
Lemme get her car and drive it
Everytime she see Lil Boosie she smilin'
[CHORUS x2:]
Wish I could fuck her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my..
Distant lover..
So many miles away
Distant lover..
so many miles away
At night I'm on that dro
Just thinkin' bout my distant lover
Wishin' I could call her up and go fuck her
But she stay so many miles away and it's hard
And if I ain't got no shows, I can't even see my broad
She know a nigga livin' large so when we fuckin'
Lil mama gimme everything, she ain't scared of nuttin
She get on top and drop it like it's hot, I'm steady nuttin
My distant lover a lil sexy lil sumthin'.. huh bro.. huh bro..
Now my Tampa chick
She bout what she be talkin' bout
Nasty girl.. take it out her ass put it in her mouth
Knew she was a freak when she got in the backseat
She said she wanted me and B
We left her shakin' in the sheets
Now my Georgia Peach, ooh
We gon' thug til the end
She don't give a fuck about no lady or none of my friends
And when she see me man, she hug me
Tell me how bad she wanna fuck me
I had to show her how to suck me
Nicknamed her ""Coldblood""
[CHORUS x2:]
Wish I could fuck her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my..
Distant lover..
So many miles away
Distant lover..
so many miles away
[Verse:]
Girl, I got feelings for you
Mane, I'm on some shit like middle school
I'm tryna write ya letters since I can't come home and tickle you
I'll fuck her wit her lil dude I need that pussy from you every night
Cuz I know it gon' be wet and right
A candlelight dinner cuz wit me, you a winner
If you wit me, you ridin' Davins other spinners for 'ginners
I got redbones in different places, every one's got a pretty face
Every one let me grip their waist, every one know I don't play
My thugged out chick, I can't fuck her too often
She bring problems in my life and she do too much talkin'
But I gotta give it to her, with that mouth she the sickest
If you put work up in her hand, she gon' move it wit the quickest
Now my California chick, she the type you don't need
She always trippin' on me when I smoke my weed
I told her, ""girl, if you don't like it, then you can get to hykin""
I wasn't trippin' when you told me you was dykin'..!
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..
Wish I could fuck her everyday
But she stay so many miles away
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..
Wish I could fuck her everyday
But she stay so many miles away
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..
Wish I could fuck her everyday
But she stay so many miles away
She.. my ..distant lover nigga..

[CHORUS: Fade out]
Wish I could fuck her everyday
Touch her in everyway
But she stay so many miles away
She my..
Distant lover..
So many miles away
Distant lover..

She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating
[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
[Lil Webbie] - Verse 3
Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited til we get to the room
Cuz I've been rocked up since I met you
I'm ready to give you the blues
Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is
[Chorus - repeat 4X]
Girl give me that pussy

[Boosie:]
I been goin' thru some shit

tryin' to sell 100,000
but they burnin' my CD's (thats fucked up)
niggas and bitches
please
won't you get me help
get your ass up off the computer
and buy this shit up off the shelf
cause I wanna ride candy man
just like the others
sometimes I wish I shoulda take the good route
like my brother
These niggas say they love ya
but they get dope
how you a rat like that
and try to steal ya ho
I still cope
And these niggas wanna rap about you
know you a soldier
but they still wanna bring that savage out you
to get exposed
and these hoes they for the money
tell your old lady dirty lies
but they know they frontin'
check this out
in baton rouge
it's real wicked
and you can't go platinum now here
cause this ain't New York City
and all my cousins doin' time
thuggin' in the pen
I'm thinkin' bout em
everytime I take a sip of henn
and I ain't gonna lie
I don't wanna be like cammaflogue
I met him one week
the next week he died
I almost cried
damn
[Chorus:]
I been goin' thru some thangs
and don't nobody understand me man
I want rock candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs

I been goin' thru some thangs
and don't nobody understand me man
I want rock candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
hopin' my niggas stay the same
but they always change
They hatin' cause I'm VIP
Ride through my city
with my hat bent like TIP
I'm all G
they got a niggas signin a deal
but they can't talk like I be talkin'
cause I spit the real
till I get killed
these niggas changin' like a weather
think he your nigga
but you lookin' at the fuckin' devil
who want your bezzle
and that voice that he wish he had
jealousy got niggas creepin' down to bust ya ass
we livin' fast
but you notice I got em B
money cars clothes and hoes
till they pocket me
This for my niggas down in Texas
all the fuckin' swingers
who got the whole other side of town
wanna thank em
I'm stressin' cause the things I did
Not wearin a rubber got me stuck now with three kids
this shit is real
wish I had a real friend to holla
they tend to laugh
when I tell em bout my fuckin problems
But I be stackin' the feds
so I be straight when I'm gone
I been prayin' for webbie
cause webbie wild with that crown
[Chorus:]
I been goin' thru some thangs
and don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
hopin' my niggas stay the same

and don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
hopin' my niggas stay the same
but they always change
[Boosie:]
I'm sippin gallons tryin' to ease the pain
Hopin my niggas keep it gutta
but they seem to change
that's why I'm solo
blowin' dodo in a different city
thinkin' these niggas tryin' to do me
but they rollin' wit me
My ho da sickest
but she listen to what the streets say
that got me stressin
cause she might be leavin' anyday
I try to pray
but when I holla he ain't holla back
that's why I'm missin' prayer daily
tryin' to get these stacks
why that
the situation that I'm in
the judge tryin' to send me to the pen
and give me ten
and do me in
got me stressin' on some major shit
my mama agin'
and my grandma and my baby's sick
this hatin' shit
got me one step away from clickin'
this me against the world livin'
got all my people bitchin'
I look my mama in her eye
told her respect the game
she like boosie leave it alone
look at craig ganes
damn
[Chorus:]
I been goin' thru some thangs
and don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
hopin' my niggas stay the same
but they always change
I been goin' thru some thangs
and don't nobody understand me man
I want ride candy man
I been goin' thru some thangs
hopin' my niggas stay the same

[Outro:]
That's real life right here
you go through so much
you know what I'm sayin'
nigga be thinkin' nigga be ballin'
but a nigga be strugglin' at the same time

i went below deck got four techs and got in the corner
and my daughter right behind me so dont nobody wont harm her
when i first when up on deck creepin slow wit my nine

duck threw a hit pow clocked him and hit the floor
no its one more i hear the nigga walkin
he in the toy room and toys fixin to get to talkin
he hit the hallway and waved his pistols dogg from side to side
i reached down low spied him and hit him right between the eyes
then i woke up sweatin snd you know why cuz

I need my money in stacks
If it dont work
I work these rhymes
Ima turn to my gats
I need cash
And plus I need it fast
Thats why I gotta ski mask
If I ever need to blast
Since I found out
About you we been hangin out like the fellas
You the reason why
I'm beefin wit them niggas
Who be jealous
We'll thug up to the end
Thats cause you my fuckin friend
Tought me straight out the ben
When they had me facin ten
Its just like we kin
So together we actin fools
You the one that got Lil Boosie
Poppin out of Baton Rouge
Thats cause I pay my dues
We gon sit back and just laugh
Where the chicks?
Critic corners cash
Look I need you bad, I need you
(chorus)
Since I was small
I been tryin to make some cheese
Till I snatched a purse at 12
And stole a couple peas
And now I keep my sacks in a dorito bag
My rocks in my mouth
Plus I'm on G-Street
The hardest road and block on the south
And now I'm poppin it off
And stackin green
Got my first thousand dollas
And I aint even 17
And plus I keep that thing in my hand
Cuz I dont care
Go to school with a grand
I pull it out and hoes stare
But without you I ain't shit
I hate to say but it the truth
I almost slipped these hoes
Fuckin me just to get to you
We have never had no problems
As long as you keep in touch
And I love living this life
Thats why I need you so much thats why I need you so much
(chorus)
You the reason went home kickin doors off
You the one that bought my clothes
Put my goals in my mouth
But at times I got to sit back
And wonder why you sin
You the one that got my nigga in a fez doing ten
We don't look at the bad cars
We look at all the fun shit
Hoes and fast cars and power make you run shit
Long as you coming
I cant complain thats the game
Like all we need is weed
Man I need my fuckin change
If I didn't I would be lame probably still on the corner
Tryin to make $200 off an ounce of marajuna
But its times like this
Like when my problems gettin deeper
You gotta understand niggas rapping cuz they need ya they need ya

[Verse 1: VL Mike]
Yeah I pop collar, and I pop tags
I got that bentley thing, shorty be pushin a jag
Nigga I don't stunt with it, but I love to look good
Keep they mouth wide open when I come through the hood
Yeah I see him watchin, I know he mad with me
But he know what's coming behind if he try to get me
I hit the club hard, then I hit the block
[Female] VL done copped somethin else, [VL Mike] girl you know how I rock
[Gar]
Now when I pull up on the set, them doors go up on the whip
Them big ol' loin hards sit up under three or four bricks
Now that's a 745, my diamonds blue as Cantrell
I'm bumpin everyday I'm hustlin and they say, [Females] I can tell
[Gar] Hell I, gotta make 'em mad and show my ass when I come through
I'm notorious like B.I. when it come to the hustle
And I'm serious like T.I. when I'm flexin my muscle
Bustas do what you could, boy I do what I want do

Ain't no boys like them Chopper City Boyz 'cause them Chopper City Boyz

Soon as I crept up on the seen (clean), fellas lookin jealous
Jay, Gizzle, Hakizzle, Gar, VL bruh, then Ziggy and Lil' Steppa
Fresh out the crib shit you know what it is, I make 'em move like Ludacris
Then soon as I pull up, big truck, I ruin it
I'm doing it, pursuiting it, wrist blue as a crowd
Haters can lose it but I'm foolish ain't no cooling me down
It's your whip, your chick, your money, your house
[Hakizzle]
You know it
I got it, I ain't scared to show it (yeah)
Whip sanction (uh)
Roll the carpet (that's right)
Chopper City tryna see a diamond market (believe it)
Ride in that jag expensive fare, we floss it (yeah)

[Verse 3: B.G.]
Look, I'm on top and they hate it, niggaz made 'cause I made it
It's a award for real niggaz, I know I'm nominated

I whip it in trial everytime, I ain't taking probation
I'm in another world (world), man I stay in that zone (zone)
I done proved to the world (world), that I can hold my own (own)
Now I'm back with my homies (back), and we ready for war (war)
Yall ain't ready for Snipe, Mike, Kizzle, and Gar (Gar)
I'm in the backfield (field), playing the sideline (line)
In case I gotta catch a nigga from the blind side
I got more ice than you got songs in ya iPod (damn)
Triple black S-five-fifty that's how I ride
Oh you thought it was funny (funny), critics was full of doubt (doubt)
You see how important Chopper City is to the south (chop chop)

Stop being mad 'cause ya time on the clock done ran out

Tried to be good but it was thugs that tend to show me love//
So thats all I knew/
Looked up to my brother cause I respected what he been through~
Never took shit from any nigga's crew//
He said~
(AG and Speedy)
Neva let a nigga get da upper hand/
It might be hard do what you can to protect yo land//
Real niggas tend survive and dats da main plan/
Hold ya own and make the world respect you as a man//
- So I took it and ran, now I give a damn/
Very loyal I am, always down for my fam//
Confident I stand, wit this mic in my hand/
Spit not a lot but da truth, now I'm da fans demand//
Dat was never da plan, supposed to be a Pro/
Spend all my life wit some hoe, at da nearest court//
All of my love for da game, slowly disappeared/
A resident in dis rap world and I'm happy here//
My words respected so F it I might be happy here/
My Smith n Wesson if fitted I stay protected here//
I'm youuung but sincere do in bout nothin but a year/
Sending tight lines to ear I'm a role model to my peers//
It's been one hell of a year but still I never once complained/
Try ta shatter my problems like a window pane//
Sick of dem dudes in da suits dat pursue to be rude/
And misuse dey power so they abuse da rules//

Mama wonder why ya child so baaad
Look where we aaat
Mama wonder why ya child so baaad - Soo baaad
Look where we aaat

AG:
Ya'll know where da fuck I been/
Success, and good times where da fuck ya'll been?//
Realize da mindstate dat I'm in/
My pops and brother stay in Texas I can't see from da State I'm in//
Tryin not to get locked up like my boy Lil' Ken/
We livin in da battle dat we wasn't meant to win//
Against all odds like Tupac - /
I gotta my other brother's big Bro and his damn Pops//
And that's all because another nigga/
I'm teachin my brothers to be fathers when dey grow up~
Don't be dat other nigga//
Mama I regret lots a shit dat I said/
Bein in my position, its lots a shit in my head//
I can't explain why I'm in the place dat I'm at/
I'm not talkin bout physically I'm talkin mentally, where am I at? HUHN/
My mouth keep me in drama/
Fuck manners I call everybody Niggas, like Antwone Fisher's Mama/
Mess wit my life or my family/
I put dis on god sista, it's gone be a fatality//
I'm tryna turn my hopes into realities/
That's the way it is that's the way it gotta be//
In da future, I'mma keep da heat ta blow ya mind/
Closet lookin like San Francisco - inside it I'mma have about 40 9's//
I aint sayin dat I'mma be a killa/
but these days you gotta protect ya scrilla - i'm focused//
Ya'll cant change my mind/
I'm rappin so I can make some change off da thangs in my mind//
Heart of a lion wit me, I'm notorious ready ta die/

Can't make decisions in my own life cause da world tryna run it//
Sometimes I feel like runnin grabbin da gun n bustin/
Don't give a fuck what I'm hittin long as I'm dumpin at something//
But I~
Keep my composure though the pressure is building/
Stuck in a system destined ta fail cause shit be twisted//
Spittin - what I feelin spark a blunt ta forget it/
Try ta tell it to my mother but I know she won't get it//
Industries to da government man dis shit fucked up/
Niggas get fucked up fucked ova cuase da shit so corrupt//
Cops looking for nigga even if I aint do nothin/
Give me a lil' incentative to try n do somethin//
But I'mma keep movin on til da hurtin is gone/
Pressin on through hell on earth livin in da New Babylon//

Now I love them gangstas from the lil ones to the ol g's
From the weed papers to the Optimo leaves we blow trees
So think about it when you step in that water
You wanna thug but you gotta thug harder nigga
[Chorus:] [x4]
So you sho you wanna be a gangsta?
Boosie I'm thuggin I ain't backin down from nothin I'm bout bussin
[Verse 2:]
Verse two for the niggaz who knock knock who really wanna chop
For the niggaz who change like grades and made me write that animosity
For the niggaz who rap about you but that only make you betta
Everytime I hear my name its like anotha love letter
This for them niggaz worst than you dude
For them niggaz who petti jack for thowbacks and Fubu
For the niggaz who steady stack ya playem' they a shoot you
For the one who drop hits on you bitches like Lil Boo do
You don't know bout the game you need a nigga to come and school you
You don't know bout this pain yo closest nigga he a fool you
You bust and you bang

Anotha shot of that hen I'm gon be tipsy man
Since they killed solja you will neva catch me slippin man
Lets grip this thing and fill our enemies with hot lead
Bury me thuggin I ain't scared just like Pac said

But they keep callin back so I gotta make runs
[Chorus:] [x4]

Why the fuck you tryin to fuck me when you got a man?
Wonder if my girl like that
Think about it
Thats what got me packin and im out (lets go)
She keep on asking me about hoes everyday
But I'm coming home to you
So fuck what these hoes say
But its time to go
So now I'm searching at the club
Hoping I can find someone like me a straight thug
With a heart of a winner
Who fix me breakfast and dinner
Who dont fuss when I get home
Just let me go up in her
Thats whats I'm looking for
A girl who fall from a rookie
Brought up she got to be brought so all my haters can look at her
Through the door
Lookin at all these little cuties
And I was hopin one of them would like to get with Lil Boosie
So I picked the realest one out of the click
Grabbed her by the shoulder
And told her this
Chorus
I need a thug in my life (I need a thug)
You aint gotta be my wife
Just hold me now when its tight
And we gone ride first class
you aint gotta afraid anything wont you ask (x2)
Now on the first day she told me
That we could only be friends
Said she was hurt once before by this little nigga with ends
Ran into me bout her problems
And she layed on the pillow
Told me how her mama died
And how her pops was a killer
Told me how she lost her virigin to this nigga who lied
Broke her heart told her he loved her just to get up a side
Thats when we went on the ride to New Orleans
I made her smile the whole time
I laced a bottle of wine
And told her this and said should be
And when I asked her can I have her heart she said could be
I told her bout my life time and thats when she started to cry
Told me she couldn't believe me that I was walkin a lie
I told her all I want from her is her heart
Don't worry bout the sex we can do that when you want start
She ain't wanna go home so I let her stay with me
And whispered in her ear right before she laid asleep
Chorus
As time went on we got on
Now three months later we major
Back and forth to Las Vegas
Smokin (???)
And the hoes mad (ha)
I told them get there shit together now we'll them later
On the richest (?)
See my bitch about whatever
And she was tought by Torrence Azel so she was tought by the devil
Wont no thug when I met her
But I see it up in her
And she love my thug pleasures
So I got me a winner
Breakfast and dinner
She had me like a thug on time
And when we fuck her she be screaming like I'm touching her spine
I know I'm touching her mind
Cause she ain't never had a thug
Who fuck her in a suite over the city in a tub
And money don't change
She stay the same in the thick in thin
Kept her pussy in her draws
When I went out I shoulda been
That's right she tried my benz
She more than a friend
She the one who took the charge when the dought got kicked in
Ya heard me

U ain't bout that murda murda shit
U ain't down to lose yo cool and go and hurt a bitch
We got them hook ups on them rentals now we murkin shit
Tinted up spinnin spinnin let that 30 spit
Bitch do want fuckin family in black clothes
The bitches in black dresses the niggas in black vo's(u ain't know)
I'm cut throat Kinival imma buy the bar survival
Sip syrup and smoke fire and i'm wilder(than an average thug)
I'm hard headed my momma told me that
And u got to be real all this drama showed me that
Lose yo mind if u want to(if u want to)
I gotta click of real niggas who gon stomp u
And want u to be hollerin bout that iron plate(that iron plate)
And we gon hit yo street tonite and not the next day
The Tec spray nigga don't worry bout that
They gon get what they deserve bout that
We gon cut down they whole curve bout that

U ain't bout what u be talkin bout(uhn ahh)
U ain't ready for yo momma to be walkin out(uhn ahh)

Quit that talkin and walkin if u gon serve me then serve me
Now i'm young trill entertainment so know one thang i ain't worryed
Cause my family do damage business ain't handled its murda
Niggas sweeter than skittles so they spittin in riddles
See that little shit u be spittin gon have u sleep in hospitals
And if u beef wit my niggas we gonna really squad up
From choppas to a 6 bitch u can't avoid us
Rappin bout smokin that killa don't even smoke killa
Even if u did i wouldn't even smoke witcha
Ya bitch ya fraud ya fake ya muthafuckin fluke
Pussy all wet ya fuckin booty all loose

Gangsta shit jump off boy u know u finna run out
Close yo fuckin mouth fore i rip yo damn tongue out

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
U ain't bout layin under a nigga house like a mouse
And u light his ass up when he come out(when its a drought)
We get sick wit it u heard about lil Trell
Gunned downed when he was 12 ever since then its been hell
And Webbie they don't live like we live(fuck no)
They don't deal like we deal they ain't real like we real
Look i'm from that track like that bottom of that SSB
Whateva u call it that shit lives in me them niggas kill for free
Like lil Trell on the lum
Cause u niggas ain't my equal and they hatin on this lil thug
A lot of niggas scared of y'all but not me
This for them niggas in rap game who knock me but can't stop me
And my posse is full of thugs
Like Headbussa baby Junior and my nigga Jug
We dumpin slugs on a enemy
I thought u was my closest friend but now on u just a friend to me
And this fuckin penetentary make niggas think they real
But when they get out they got a nerve to pop a pill(but look here)

Yung Joc we got a hit lets go baby
Everybody like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
They on them dubs like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
[Verse 1: Boosie]
I'm Boosie Bad Azz and i zoom like fire
760 patna krispy kreme on tires
Smoke that fire purple **** by the pound
Ask my dawg Webbie this is how it goes down
From my hood to yo hood mayne we makin money
N da club we poppin bottles
The room we hittin models
Rollin through the Bottom all the kids hollin Boosie
This life a nigga livin like im starrin n a movie
Fresh out the jaccuzzi lil powder on my chest
Got 30 my neck Turk and Mel jus cut the check
Naw im zoomin n my chrger on them 24's
Gotta think about Big Head and Pimp so slow ya roll
Ice cold from my neck to my wrist we gettin paid
On my feet i got them j's play wit me i got them k's
Red Gucci shades me and Joc gettin paid
naw the whole United States takin pictures all day
[Chorus:]
A fresh pair of j's i hit the stuntin
Wit a fresh pair of shades makin that money
Everbody gettin paid everything lovely and im doin my thing my thing my thing
Everybody like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
We on them dubs like zoom zoom zoom zoom zoom
We walk up in the club
[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
You see the way i hustle they think im Rick Ross
Jus as soon as i **** em tell them **** to get lost
A lot of niggas mad they all pissed off
If a nigga think he bad tell him jump like chris cross
im poppin ? tags cuz the wrist cost
? shell how to break a soft
Just ask my nigga Boosie he tell u wat it iz
Face card good cuz the face card trill
If u gotta problem i suggest u head home
He in the red zone **** leave ya head gone
Don't hit me on my chirp thats the fed phone
Talkin bout the work u dead wrong
Can't believe i keep them beans for them **** tell em dreams
Ain't no **** on my team
Like my clothes crispy clean
I like my dough Krispy kreme
64 on lean
thats my nigga mouse and turk and got the work for the fiends
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Boosie]
Mayne i been zoomin n my drop top mobbin through the city
Fresh fade fresh j's wit 2 bad bit****
One name sarah one name tina
together they make weather like katrina (they a fool)

she get on back of that motorbike and all u c iz back on that motorbike
I drive fastcars
They call me nascar
You feel me but im in love wit the hemi
Get retarded n ferraris i get loose in the coupe paranoid like pac so i keep that glock

[Chorus]
