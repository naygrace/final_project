[Verse One]
Brace yourself soloists, duos, trios
It's the captain of ""Hay dios mio!""
In Spanish, or English, I had to bring this
And I know that you probably think this
is a joke, so laugh, sleep on me snore
Feel the wrath of a giant, like never before
Returned to the environment to see where the fire went
I'm not sixty-five, I'm not retirin
A legend in the old school, better today
I bust a sucker in a battle, the same old way
I did when I used to, I got the juice to
Put the best you got against and they'll lose to
the Grandest-master, the Pope and the pastor
The judge and jury and if you think I am a rasta-
-farian or Jamaican, you're mistakin
I specialize in rappin, and flakin
on sucker MC's, and wannabeez
Beat me in a battle?  Nigga please!?!
Ain't no one better than, the rap veteran
And this here is just another feather in
my cap, because my rap
It sing to the beat, just like a hi-hat
You can try your damndest, to understand this
Showtime is at two, to see the Grand-est!
[Verse Two]
I don't like to boast that I'm better than most
But if you try to get beside yourself, I'll roast you
and your boy, or any MC toy
if you think you think that you can mess with the Real McCoy!
You gotta be great, to try to rate
with the hall of fame rhymes, that I create
And even if you can, they're still a flash in the pan
compared to the way I am when the mic's in my hand
MC's I'll romp - they ain't no comp!
And when they try to get familiar - I stomp
their mouth because, I'm what it is and they was
And no one does it to you like the captain does
[Verse Three]
I DJ'ed in house parties, with BSR's
Transportation for my set?  Two or three cars
Carried amps in the rain, speakers in the snow
Spent more than I made when I did a show
Played in clubs in the winter, without no heat
In dressin rooms, with rats, runnin under my feet
The blackout in '77, the city went dark
Had my whole sound system jammin in the park
Paid my dues, I'm a vet, so don't even try me
Been in parties rockin rhymes watchin bullets go by me
Sparkle Dixie, Ecstasy, Garage or the Bomb
The T-Connection, The Ready, the list goes on
Black Door, the P-A-L, the Bronx River Center
When you first heard of rap, that's where you went
to see vets like me, G-M-C
The L-O-R-D, of R-A-P
[Verse Four]
Well sometimes it's hard, bein MC God
like fightin Sugar Ray, or Matthew Sodd(?)
Tradin blow for blow with MC's you know
Lookin for the knockout or the T-K-O
But I reign supreme over those who dream
Cold Crush had the ice and I had the cream
Goin down in the books, as the one who looks
down on unrighteous rappers and MC crooks
The spot's secure, my mind is sure
What else would the people jock me for
except, maybe the fact, I'm G-M-C
or got a harem like a sheik, of Arab be
It could be because I'm tall handsome slim and brown
or the way the crowd breaks, when I get down
or how the ladies gather round when the party's over
or maybe because my name is Casanova
But whatever the story, whatever the reason
The audience I will continue pleasin
for the rest of my life, til the day I die
cause I'm the Grandmaster Caz, and you know I
am right, polite, goody-good in the night
And the chances that I'm not are less than slight

There's already too many men in the moment of silence
Too many with handkerchiefs, too many wreaths
because there's not enough indians and too many chiefs
Cause there's, too many tears, and too many sides
Too many ""we gonna miss him""s, and too many goodbyes
Too many flowers for baskets, too many caskets
cause there's, too many shootings, and not enough ass kicks
Yeah, too many gangsters, and too many thugs
Too many G's too many hoods, and too many drugs
Too many mac-10's, too many techs and .38's
Not enough food, on too many plates
Too many Tony Montanas pushin a Lexus
Not enough Medgar Evers, or Malcolm X's
Too many brothers locked, in institutions
Yeah, too many problems, and no solutions
Too much, for too many people
in the thought we was all created equal
Too much, for too many people
and if things don't change there won't be no sequel
There's, too many enemies, not too many friends
Too many poor people, without too many ends
Too many politicians runnin, with too many crooks
Too many kids in one classroom, and no books
Too many broken promises, and too many lies
Too many girls buyin dreams, from too many guys
Too many young black brothers doin too many bids
Too many single black mothers raisin too many kids, alone
Too much sicknesses and too much disease
Too many genocidal blacks, too many degrees of seperation
causin too much strife
Too many things known in the ghetto that can take your life
It's too much, for too many people
in the thought we was all created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
There's, too much pop and not enough soul
Too many things we create but we don't control
Too many people walkin round, with not enough hope
Too much crack, and way too much DOPE
Too many fathers not around, to raise their children
Too many empty lots and abandoned buildings
Too many jails bein built and not enough schools
Too many rappers ain't droppin no jewels!
Too much negativity, in the things we say
and not enough about showin us a better way
Too many young black soldiers, in too many graves
Too many of us still thinkin like slaves!
Time to break the chains and the ties that bind
and elevate ourselves to a, greater state of mind
Set some positive examples for the youth!
Teach them well so they know the truth, cause now
it's too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all, created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel
Too much, for too many people
In the thought we was all, created equal
Too much, for too many people
And if things don't change there won't be no sequel!

(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the
To the beat y'all)
And yes y'all
This one goes out to all the homeboys
>From the old school
Takin you way, way back
When we used to rhyme like this
Check it out
[ VERSE 1 ]
Ain't nothin but a party, everybody come along
Keep your body movin while I'm groovin with the song
I got funky rhythms, funky rhythms with a beat
Funk-funk-funk-funky rhythms for the street
Keep clappin while I'm rappin, while I'm rappin, clap your hands
Listen to the, listen to the, listen to the man
Turn the party out without a doubt I'm in the house
Kick it to the beat is what it's really all about
Party, party people, if you're ready, listen up
Cause I can get the lyrics, Easy Lee can get the cut
An automatic systematic rhythmatic sound
If you ain't with the program, you gotta get it down
Breakin competition, competition's ripped apart
Find another brother, cause L.L. ain't got the heart
I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the
To the beat y'all)
[ VERSE 2 ]
If I'm mentally conditioned, then I'm physically prepared
To cold rock a party with the microphone I bear
I'm ready for action, satisfaction guaranteed
Give the people what they want, and what they want is what they need
Desperately to hear a brother kick a rhyme like this
Don't settle for another, cause you know what time it is
Time to pick your feet up, put your body in the mode
And listen to a real rap veteran explode
Other sucker brothers always comin incomplete
Forget about the lyrics, cause they only want the beat
And other punk brothers put a curse in every verse
Frontin cause nobody taught em how to rhyme first
Frontin like you're hard, but it's only a facade
And now you're goin out like a sucker like Todd
But I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the
To the beat y'all)
[ VERSE 3 ]
Excercisin patterns, sowin up the rappin scene
Rockin for the people like a funky rap machine
Synchronize a party cause the party people watch
Only dancin when I tell em cause I rock round the clock
Masters of the ceremony's one and only one
Can rock it like a rocket, phoney homies better run
Cause I'm doin the damage and the damage will be done
Lyrics are the bullets, so I never need a gun
Just a microphone, speakers, tables and a plug
Sit back and watch the people cut themselves and slice a rug
And I'ma rock a party till it's time to bring it home
And when they pull a plug, then I'ma pack a microphone
Put it in my holster like a gun, and then I'm gone
Strapped, ready to rap and on and on and on
I can take a rhythm, make you sing it like a song
This is To The Beat, you can forget Da Break Of Dawn
(To the beat y'all
To the beat y'all
To the - to the
To the beat y'all)
And yes y'all
As we proceed to move on
'To Da Break Of Dawn'
He-he-he-he-he...
Takin you all the way back
The way we used to do it for you and yours

yea yea Time to settle the score
To the break of dawn  another dumb move
Ha  ha  ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you  head to head  let's go
Here we go  beat down round 2
Heads up punk 'cause it all comes down to
Me and you  face to face  head to head
Mic to mic  I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn  beats nitro
Lyrics weak, say goodnight 'cho
Star Trek shades, man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, g
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E, you're rhyme didn't mean
?D-O-D-D?, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it, yea, finish, burp
Now let a real man go to work
'Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics wit rabies
Cut ya like a knife 'cause you're nuthin but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow
(Chorus)
Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow
My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain of fatigue, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears of violence
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow
Chorus
If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy
Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here

""Rated XXX""
For the ladies, one hundred and ninety-five pounds of beef,
chinky eyes, curly hair and gold teeth,
Swingin' with this here stud, you need practice,
i'm leaving floods of blood on your mattress,
I'll leave you holdin' your swollen backside and rollin',
fillin' all three holes just like bowlin',
Don't ask me what the price is,
but it's more than your battery-operated devices,
And I come fully equipped,
with a temperature adjustment to heat up the tip,
For demonstrations, watch me slam her,
you'll notice the sound of steady poundin',
Like a jackhammer once on it, ya can't cop out,
i'm poundin' ya down until your eyeballs pop out,
I'm not your ordinary player,
because you'll leave in a wheelchair, dear, after I lay ya,
Get a grip on your headboard and hold on to it,
or get sent right through it,
Bite your nipples when I lick 'em,
not gentle when I stick 'em, huh,
I'll leave 'em lookin' like a rape victim,
any girl who steps to it,
Ends up gettin' their stomach pumped like Rod Stewart,
i do a damn good job,
That's why -
Chicks are on my dick like a human shish kebab
Only nineteen and over permitted,
no matter how much young girls wanna be with it,
You ain't ready for the bed,
you still got a pussy like Isaac Hayes' head,
Come back in five years,
when ya grow some hairs and when ya started drinkin' beers,
I'm hittin' hookaz by the dozen,
makin' ya wetter 'cause I fuck better than your husband,
Givin' ya girl back spasms,
cause G Rap has 'em orgasm after orgasm,
Change the sheets? Ya must be kiddin',
ya gotta change the whole box spring,
I ain't bullshittin', you get hit with hysteria,
cause I'ma bury a big one inside your private area,
All hell is in your tush,
when Kool G. Rap push pushes inside this bush,
Anotha homegirl flinches,
but I got inches for all you lil' wenches,
The letter G is better when it comes to the letter X,
An' I'ma talk like sex
Rated XXX
""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""
Some say that I'm nasty plus,
hookaz are mad because they can't outlast me,
Girl, you ain't too small,
cause I turn your crystal to one size fits all,
So if you're still confused when I'm screwin',
let me explain to you exactly what I'm doin',
Exploring your body like a biologist,
inventin' new ways just like a scientist,
Taggin' my name on your buns just like a printist,
while I'm hurtin' your ass just like a dentist,
You're so wild I feel like I'm a zoologist,
stretchin' your shit more than a gynecologist,
I'm gonna twist your ass to death, miss,
and when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist,
G Rap is hot blooded, freakin' horny,
far from corny, come and jump on me,
I'm not small and all, I won't break down a stall,
i drive the ass up the wall,
Nuts and everything are well in shape,
the only thing missin' on my dick is a cape,
Let's get togetha, honey, ya never know what's next,
and I'ma talk like sex,

""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""
Big girls try to squash me,
but I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me,
Hit the sack cause I ain't jokin',
cause when I start pumpin' shit up, I leave it smokin',
So ya betta hold on tight all right,
cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite,
A stick, a trick, and it kills her,
i'm probably related to Long Dong Silver,
But it gets gooder and gooder,
every time I grab a hooka and I put her on my frankfurter,
Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip,
cause the only thing I'm lickin' is your ass with a whip,
And it's a real freaky scene,
i'm hittin' girls with their heads in a guillotine,
Why certainly I'm squirtin',
bust your nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain,
Pushin' your head to the pillow,
and givin' more pleasure than a double-headed dildo,
A big ass gives me a hard-on,
but I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton,
Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety,
i'll fuck you on the ""A"" train while I write graffiti,
In a restaurant, takin' you straight to heaven,
in a cab or the back of 7-11,
Whether you're white and the music you like is rock,
you can come and get some hip-hop cock,
Consider this dick on your clitoris,
but never try to flex, cause I'ma talk like sex.

Like a doctor
When I rock the mic
You got to like
The way I operate
I make miracles happen
Just from rappin'
I'm so lyrically potent
And I'm flowin'
And explodin'
On the scene mean
I got the potential
To make you go
Then chill
I got the credentials
That is of which I chose
To make a rhyme
And chill
Then you know
I will fulfill
To make a couple of mill
As I build a guild
For all the rappers and skills
And kill the weak rappers and no thrills
Hang 'em an ephigy
If he's a sucker
Hang 'em to the left of me
Cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and
The microphone that I own
And my game plan
Is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush
It ain't no race
I'ma hit the top
Just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time
And I'm gonna
Cause I know when to
Go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap
That sent ya
Runnin' around
Holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy
Yo man
You hear what he said
Another funky rhythm
Look at ya man
And give him a high five
Cause I'm live
Runnin' around with him
Telling everybody
Hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up
And check the clock
Punch it
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
Like an architect
I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word
With each letter it becomes visably better
Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vaction
I came to roam
The land I own
And stand alone on the microphone
Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace
Start the race
I'm coming in first
With each verse
I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya
I have to slap ya
Senseless with
Endless rhymes don't pretned this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done
Your mind will become
So trapped in the rap
You'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time
I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect
And it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
Like a boxer
Train the brain and aim
To out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya
So hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks
So power packed
Before you can react
You're flat on your back
Down for the count
Get up and dismount
Cause I'm coming
With an endless amount
Of words in a hurry
Like a flurry
A collage to camouflage
The power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote
Rhymes at a level
So you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent
So stay awake
Sleepwalkers
Slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow
You blow
You know you go
I flow
I throw all pro
I go to work
I go to work
To say rap is not work
Is ludicrous
Whoever said it
Must be new to this
When you hear me
You'll compare me

Not merely
Putting words together for

Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work

""Rated XXX""
For the ladies, one hundred and ninety-five pounds of beef,
chinky eyes, curly hair and gold teeth,
Swingin' with this here stud, you need practice,
i'm leaving floods of blood on your mattress,
I'll leave you holdin' your swollen backside and rollin',
fillin' all three holes just like bowlin',
Don't ask me what the price is,
but it's more than your battery-operated devices,
And I come fully equipped,
with a temperature adjustment to heat up the tip,
For demonstrations, watch me slam her,
you'll notice the sound of steady poundin',
Like a jackhammer once on it, ya can't cop out,
i'm poundin' ya down until your eyeballs pop out,
I'm not your ordinary player,
because you'll leave in a wheelchair, dear, after I lay ya,
Get a grip on your headboard and hold on to it,
or get sent right through it,
Bite your nipples when I lick 'em,
not gentle when I stick 'em, huh,
I'll leave 'em lookin' like a rape victim,
any girl who steps to it,
Ends up gettin' their stomach pumped like Rod Stewart,
i do a damn good job,
That's why -
Chicks are on my dick like a human shish kebab
Only nineteen and over permitted,
no matter how much young girls wanna be with it,
You ain't ready for the bed,
you still got a pussy like Isaac Hayes' head,
Come back in five years,
when ya grow some hairs and when ya started drinkin' beers,
I'm hittin' hookaz by the dozen,
makin' ya wetter 'cause I fuck better than your husband,
Givin' ya girl back spasms,
cause G Rap has 'em orgasm after orgasm,
Change the sheets? Ya must be kiddin',
ya gotta change the whole box spring,
I ain't bullshittin', you get hit with hysteria,
cause I'ma bury a big one inside your private area,
All hell is in your tush,
when Kool G. Rap push pushes inside this bush,
Anotha homegirl flinches,
but I got inches for all you lil' wenches,
The letter G is better when it comes to the letter X,
An' I'ma talk like sex
Rated XXX
""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""
Some say that I'm nasty plus,
hookaz are mad because they can't outlast me,
Girl, you ain't too small,
cause I turn your crystal to one size fits all,
So if you're still confused when I'm screwin',
let me explain to you exactly what I'm doin',
Exploring your body like a biologist,
inventin' new ways just like a scientist,
Taggin' my name on your buns just like a printist,
while I'm hurtin' your ass just like a dentist,
You're so wild I feel like I'm a zoologist,
stretchin' your shit more than a gynecologist,
I'm gonna twist your ass to death, miss,
and when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist,
G Rap is hot blooded, freakin' horny,
far from corny, come and jump on me,
I'm not small and all, I won't break down a stall,
i drive the ass up the wall,
Nuts and everything are well in shape,
the only thing missin' on my dick is a cape,
Let's get togetha, honey, ya never know what's next,
and I'ma talk like sex,

""Can't ya diggit, Honey?""
""Rated XXX""
Big girls try to squash me,
but I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me,
Hit the sack cause I ain't jokin',
cause when I start pumpin' shit up, I leave it smokin',
So ya betta hold on tight all right,
cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite,
A stick, a trick, and it kills her,
i'm probably related to Long Dong Silver,
But it gets gooder and gooder,
every time I grab a hooka and I put her on my frankfurter,
Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip,
cause the only thing I'm lickin' is your ass with a whip,
And it's a real freaky scene,
i'm hittin' girls with their heads in a guillotine,
Why certainly I'm squirtin',
bust your nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain,
Pushin' your head to the pillow,
and givin' more pleasure than a double-headed dildo,
A big ass gives me a hard-on,
but I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton,
Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety,
i'll fuck you on the ""A"" train while I write graffiti,
In a restaurant, takin' you straight to heaven,
in a cab or the back of 7-11,
Whether you're white and the music you like is rock,
you can come and get some hip-hop cock,
Consider this dick on your clitoris,
but never try to flex, cause I'ma talk like sex.

If you ever wanna battle me, don't move slow
Come and get it cause I'm waitin and I got nowhere to go
Head to head, toe to toe, rhyme for rhyme, blow for blow
We can throw
Badself
When I get busy, the crowd gets dizzy
And when I'm on the stage, the party people say, ""Is he
Really human or is he a robot?""
Because when I'm on the microphone nobod-
y does the things that I do
My voice will guide you
Once you hear it, it stays inside you
Hypnotizing and mesmerizing
The cerebral cortex, but without realizing
You become confused and so enthused
Cause the rhymes I use can make you lose
Total control, and if I choose
To call you the paperboy you'll spread the news
Like Paul Revere: ""A real rapper is here!""
Yeah, ""Moe Dee is coming, Moe Dee is coming""
And teeth will chatter, plagiarism scatter
Nothing is the matter, you're just looking at a
Real rap trooper with a power so super
After battlin me, I guarantee you won't recouper-
ate cause I am great, I can make you hate
To ever look in the mirror and affiliate
Yourself with anything but an average person
Lovin my success but envious and cursin
You want my autograph, don't act like a sucker
Just gimme a pound cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
I put a hurtin on rappers, egos are crushed
Pride is swallowed, asses are bust
Hearts are taken, souls cremated
Lips are sealed and they hate it
Overrated rappers made it
On a wing and a prayer with old beats updated
But I'm not like you bitin barbarics
Rappers with the fresh beats and weak lyrics
I'm cyanide, deadly and lethal
I never run out, I got an automatic refill
I never get cold, I only get lukewarm
When I wanna get hot, I have a real brainstorm
Ideas start flowin, my talents start showin
And if the music stops, Moe Dee keeps goin
I'm bigger than life and deeper than death
The world of rap is like a kitchen and I am the chef
Boy, are these MC's really startin to irk me
Make it to the top, then try to jerk me
Ask em who's the best, their shoulders start shruggin
Like they don't know, they must be buggin
But I like the controversy, it makes me blood-thirsty
And one day I'll make them all beg for mercy
So remember that if you wanna act like a sucker
Don't ever make me mad cause I'm a bad, bad, bad mutha-
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
I'm the kinda rapper that a dummy won't dig
My IQ's too high, my words are too big
My voice too clear and my rhymes are ample
Some things I won't do, and here's an example
I won't make a 'La-Di-Da-Di', an 'Oh Veronica'
A 'Dear Ivette' or a La-'Latoya'
I'm not tryin to dis the rappers that made these cuts
As a matter of fact I like them, but
Records like that are for the average MC
Not for the highly rated Moe Dee
I have a formula, I'm like a scientist
And I must put words together like this
My voice is a ?????, coming out an orophus
Expressing ?????, verbally or if it's
Mental ??asymetrics?? that makes me so electric
By spontaneous combustion an explosion is expected
A walking time bomb that can't be disconnected
I'm a rhymer with a timer, I'm a english dialectic
My ideas are impeccable, rhymes are paragon
My soliloquy will affect ya like Farrakhan
Love me or hate me, agree or debate me
Watchin suckers gather round, bow down ????? be-
Cause what I do orally I something so morally
Stimulating, emmulating heat that's corally
My mind is both flexible and resillient
Pugnacious, tenacious ??????, I'm brilliant
Through rigorous training, it's self-explaining
Why I'm standing on the top and that's where I'm remaining
My brain rocks like Mr. Spock's
And any other MC's are knocked out the box
So you know where to kiss, so line up and pucker
Sucker MC's, I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad (mutha-)
Mutha-, mutha-, muthaf-
Now I was never solo, I was always in a group
So now you new jacks are a little too souped
So if you think you could take mine
Then come on and make my
Day, you idiot, you knew from the giddy-up
You didn't have a chance
But if you want drop the pants
I spank that ass so fast that the next time you glance
Everyone will be laughin and you'll be the stock
Cause that's what's good about havin you MC's on the jock
I could go on and on and on and on for days
But everytime I speak I get unwanted protegees
If you've been lucky so far, don't press your luck
Cause you don't really want none cause I'm a bad, bad, bad (mutha-)

Since the day I was born I was on a mission
Never played out of position or wishin or missin
I came out kissin, was no spankin the backside
Just lots of lady nurses waitin for black eyes
I - I was talkin way before I could crawl or walk
And what the ladies heard, wasn't baby talk
I'd drop a line like a bomber would drop a bomb
Highly explosive, but notice, I was cool and calm
Ready for action, at the age of 1 the fun
Was just beginning, I was winning, the ladies would come
With arms open and hopin for a kiss and a hug
I stripped down, huh, and watched the ladies bug
I stood up for a while, then I started walkin
I heard the ladies say, ""Look who's talkin""
That's right, baby, you can leave me alone
Cause if you can't please me, don't tease me, cause I'm bad to the..

yea yea Time to settle the score
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
Ha, ha, ha this time it's over boy
This is me and you, head to head, let's go
Here we go, beat down round 2
Heads up punk 'cause it all comes down to
Me and you, face to face, head to head
Mic to mic, I like the weak shit you said
To the break of dawn, beats nitro
Lyrics weak, say goodnight 'cho
Star Trek shades, man cut the joke
Let's get serious and go for broke
You still got a lock on my jock like a pitbull
Victor before you pull it off you thought Mr. Pitiful
Here's some mouthwash, g
Your mouth smells like my jockstrap, C-
A-U-S-E, you're ridin' me,
T-O-D-D, junior Moe Dee
Stop biting, chewing, swallowing
Who in the hell told you that you could do what you were doing
Raise up son, I need jock relief
Here's a toothpick, now get my jock out your teeth
You swallow it, yea, finish, burp
Now let a real man go to work
'Cause I'm a whip you like your daddy, beat ya like a baby
Sick ya like a dog, dropping lyrics wit rabies
Cut ya like a knife 'cause you're nuthin but hype
You slice and dice and ice twice for life
I'm a treat ya like a hooker punk, change your clothes
Put you on the streets wit ya jingling hoes
Keep talking about me and I'll keep pimping
Just bring me that money and take this last whipping
How can one man be so dumb
You're trying to come off and don't know how to come
You're young and dumb and quick at the tongue
You high strung bum come and get done
I'll do you wit a death blow
(Chorus)
Kill 'em kill 'em
I'll hit ya wit a death blow
My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma
Your brain is fatigued, you're out of your league
You're running out of gas and you're tank is on E
Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears, or violins
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit
A rhyme silencer, I hit 'em wit a death blow
Chorus
If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy
Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...
I did 'em wit a death blow
To the break of dawn
To the, to the, to the, get him out of here

Once again it's the brain goin against the grain
Here to entertain and rip em out of the frame
Heatin up like a flame, watch the heat maintain
As I take aim at the lame rap game
Ain't it a shame? (rap is goin crazy)
The lyrical skills (are gettin kinda lazy)
The gift they're shootin (couldn't even graze me)
Most rappers deliver enough rhythm and givin em
Limited lyrical play, gee
Now who drops rhymes for the mind, only a handful
Only the deaf, dumb and blind brothers stand still
While hundreds of maniacs sit back and kick that
Lyrical madness, flip that and get back
To funky rhymea with the flow like a lyricist
Connectin lines like a poet, I'm tired of hearin this

Only generic lyrics satisfy the mundane
Shorties with forties, and shortly after the blunts came
Brothers were buzzin and never noticed it wasn't
Nothin lyrical, hear it till the market started floodin
Dozens of fictional gangsters, nothin against your
Fake lifestyle, but your rhyme style tends to
Get repetitive, cause it's inedited you think it's better with
Explicit illicit lyrics - but like a sedative
The rhymes ain't hype, so the crowd lost sight
They shift the focus to flavor and what a brother's flow's like
So here come the flow, the lovable, huggable, colorful flow
The brother that glows, in the dark, cause out of the darkness I rose
So many new flows, I froze my foes and everyone knows
The cons and pros of steppin to Moe, the highs and lows
It's up and down and out you go
So back up, re-group, slow down and check the cut

I always wondered how a rapper never could wreck shop
But if he had a funky track and a fat hook, he'd get props
Treated like some kind of hero, most of em come no where near Moe
If you call them number one, I know that I got to be zero
I come before the one, I'm second to none
I come in the circumference 360, as if the infinite sun
Chained to the Most High, you know the rhyme's most fly
I could survive and come alive when most die
I change the scene, I flips the scripts
I wrecks the sets, I sinks the ships
So one shot, aye captain, I hate weak rappin
Brothers thinkin they're mackin, so I pimp-slap em
Showin em who's large in charge, runnin em up outta dodge

I was  walking down the street  rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neet and petite
So was so sweet  yes I wanted to meet
So I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said  Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it
They said  Did you get it?  I said  Yeah,  they said  How was it?
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said  Good night
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said  Mama mia!
I'm a kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got, the more I reminice
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said  Hey good looking, what you got cooking?
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
I went to the doctor's office, I said  What have I got?
He said  Turn around boy and take this shot
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said  What?
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt
He turned and said in a real deep voice
Have it your way, if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Is just kick her, so go take karate
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said  Next time I'll use some protection
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor

They want me to kick it like others - forget it
I tailor-made a style for the microphone
You can search the rap files but it's mine alone
I won't get in to fit in the flow, it's won't simulate
Now bein one of the best causes them to hate
The freestyle master cause I'm a outcast
You ever stop and ask yourself how to outlast
All those before me and the many that came after

Ain't no puzzle, put a muzzle on their face
And watch the hype crowd sing

Take out the negative while just like a predator I'll
Prey and on play on and stay on the airwaves
You heard I'm fallin or fell, chalk it as hear-say
Ain't no defense mechanism or criticism
Capable of doin no nothings here, that's how I'm livin
You can bring whatever you got to bring
I'm the champ, the master, the king

Well, listen up, homeboys, I got somethin to say
About a homeboy from back in the day
His name was richard, some called him rick
But if you knew him like me, you'd call him dick
When we were growin up, we stuck with each other
Like white on rice, he was kinda like a brother
We had a lotta fun when we were kids
We always overlooked the dumb things he did
But the fun was over when we got to high school
Cause it was time for gettin girlies, so we had to be cool
We had a lotta girlies, and our friends were impressed
One thing went wrong, rick got obsessed
We wouldn't go to class, always think about ass
Not if he was gonna pass, if he would just last
Girls was all he was thinkin about
If the school was all boys, he'da been dropped out
When he did drop out, he felt no shame
And if you ask me, he had the right name

[ verse 2 ]
He wouldn't go to school, but he had to survive
So he went out and got him a 9 to 5
Although he was lazy, he had to work
Cause he had a lot of girls, he needed money, the jerk
As fast as he made it, his money was spent
When it came to girls, he didn't care where he went
He'd hound em like a dog, so we used to say ""fetch!""
And it was no tellin what he would catch
He was in the doctor's office almost every week
He became so popular, everybody'd speak
When he walked in they'd say (hi rick)
And when he passed by, they'd say (dumb dick)
Really hard-headed, cause he said he had juice
But it was cause of his hard head, that he was so loose
He was in love with another girl every day
And when we asked him why, he'd only say
(I'm the kinda guy who likes to have fun
I need a lotta girls, can't have just one)
I can understand that, but this is kind of insane
Sometimes I wonder if his brain
Was his...
(d-d-d-du-du-dumb) (dumb)
(dumb dick)			(2x)
[ verse 3 ]
He lost his girl when he lost his job
So to keep himself from livin like a no-good slob
He hustled on the streets, cause he had no choice
And every day you'd hear his voice
Sayin ""jumbos! I got it good""
But he never made the money that a hustler could
Cause when he was standin out on the corner
If a girl walked by, he was right up on her
He was so hot, his heat couldn't be measured
To him his business was his pleasure
A one-track mind, and as a matter of fact
He changed his name to daddy mack
The people on the streets he was workin for
Cut him off, now he's just plain old poor
And all his girls left, because they never cared
The were leeches for a dollar, and they got their share
Homeboy disappeared like a magic trick
And everybody wanna know what happened to dick
Well, he's still around, but now he's a bum
Chasin bag ladies, he's the same old dumb
Dick

Well, listen up, homeboys, I got somethin to say
About a homeboy from back in the day
His name was Richard, some called him Rick
But if you knew him like me, you'd call him Dick
When we were growin up, we stuck with each other
Like white on rice, he was kinda like a brother
We had a lotta fun when we were kids
We always overlooked the dumb things he did
But the fun was over when we got to high school
Cause it was time for gettin girlies, so we had to be cool
We had a lotta girlies, and our friends were impressed
One thing went wrong, Rick got obsessed
We wouldn't go to class, always think about ass
Not if he was gonna pass, if he would just last
Girls was all he was thinkin about
If the school was all boys, he'da been dropped out
When he did drop out, he felt no shame
And if you ask me, he had the right name
Cause he hated to go, but he loved to come
That's why I call him Dick, cause Dick is Dumb

Funke funke wisdom
Wisdom
[ VERSE 1 ]
Money - the root of all evil
Follow the dollar, and where will it lead to?
Pseudo science, material math
6 degrees of knowledge, brother, you don't know the half
Symbolizin symbolism, excercisin exorcism
Make a little money, now you wanna tell me how you're livin
Suckers sellin what you're sellin, now you're sellin out
The devil sold a dream and you bought it without thinkin 'bout
How the beast will decrease the brain wave
With material thoughts from the crib to the grave
Slaves, got you livin just to die
For the money, lookin sweet, slick and sly
Long as you're ridin and your system's fly
You don't give a damn if your homeboys die
So we gotta find a way to get paid in this system
With or without money - with funke funke wisdom
Funke, funke, funke
Funke, funke, funke...
[ VERSE 2 ]
Women - very significant
Power is what she represents
Contrary to what many brothers believe
Learn the metaphysical meaning of Eve
When you get funke wisdom, then you'll understand
The woman is the driving force for any powerful man
>From birth to earth and earth to re-birth
It ain't a curse, put your thought in reverse
Disperse rehearse your medium, verse first
And understand it ain't a purse that can quench your thirst
For love connections and spiritual conceptions
Not a act of x-rated sex, any
Man without a woman is incomplete
And vice versa she's obsolete
So I make sure within a part of my system
I got funke funke wisdom
Funke, funke, funke
Funke, funke, funke...
[ VERSE 3 ]
Mathematically it all adds up
All people are equal, but equal in what?
Once you understand that there's a spiritual math
Add soul to the science and subtract the riff-raff
24-7-365
Cause 9 to 5 ain't live
We're in overdrive
Take the 1st power, elevate to the 3rd
Manifest the power of the spoken word
360 degrees are subliminal
Fortified with a 144 minerals
4 elements and 4 seasons
4 corners of the world, it's all even
Mother nature and father time
Aligned with the 9 planets and combined
To influence the mind and control the whole system
Knowledge ain't enough, you need funke funke wisdom
Funke, funke, funke
Funke, funke, funke...
Funke funke wisdom

I was, walking down the street, rocking my beat
Clapping my hands and stomping my feet
I saw a little lady so neet and petite
So was so sweet, yes I wanted to meet
So I asked this lady could I take her out
We could wine and dine and we could talk about
The birds and the bees in my waterbed
And you could treat me like a Buddha and bow your head
We continued to talk, and before you knew it
We were at my house and it was time to do it
As soon as I finished, I lost my poise
Ran outside and told all my boys
I said  Listen up fellas, come over here, bust it
They said  Did you get it?  I said  Yeah,  they said  How was it?
The poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
I rocked her to the left, rocked her to the right
She felt so good, hugged me so tight
I said  Good night
Three days later...
Woke up fussing, yelling and cussing
Drip drip dripping and puss puss pussing
I went to the bathroom and said  Mama mia!
I'm a kill that girl next time I see her
The madder I got, the more I reminice
Why is my thing thing burning like this?
Well I remember the first day I saw that girl
I just couldn't wait to rock her world
I said  Hey good looking, what you got cooking?
What have I done stuck my dick in?
Now I know why her ex-boyfriend Dave
Calls her Mrs. Microwave
Cause she was hotter than an oven and I had to learn
The hard way stay in the microwave too long you get burned
But the poontang was dope and you know that I rocked her
But three days later, go see the doctor
I went to the doctor's office, I said  What have I got?
He said  Turn around boy and take this shot
I looked at him like he was crazy, and I said  What?
Ain't nobody sticking nothing in my butt
He turned and said in a real deep voice
Have it your way, if that's your choice
And I'll put it down if you want me to put it
But don't blame me if it turns into a foot
Extending from the middle of your body
And the next time you see your cute hottie
You won't be able to screw, the only thing you can do
Is just kick her, so go take karate
As I turned around to receive my injection
I said  Next time I'll use some protection
If I see another girl and I get an erection
I'm walking in the other direction
Cause I don't wanna do the sick sick dance
So I'm keeping my prick inside my pants
And if I see another girl and I know I can rock her
Before I push up I'll make her go see the doctor

Left your lips, it only could get nickels and dimes

Suckers try to second-guess and question if I can
Flowin knowledge, wisdom, power, don't you understand?
I educate and radiate and motivate fam
Showin younger brothers what it is to be a man
By tearin up the party when the mic is in my hand
This is what you call a winter/spring/summer jam
Fall into the mood as the funky music slams
I know you got the rhythm, cause it runs in the fam
I gotta speak my piece, cause this ain't _Silence Of the Lambs_
I'm here to terrorize, energize, exercise, mesmerize

Givin parties in the park, and we never made papes
Rhymin from dawn till dust till dawn
6 a.m. and we was just gettin warm
Heatin up and beatin up on some dead wrong
Brother on the mic who thought he had it goin on
Talk on the mic with no poetical style
He was doggin it like he's a pathetical child
To grab a microphone a brother had to have juice
If he couldn't produce, we said he couldn't get loose
Today we would say the brother just couldn't flow
And he would be like history, homeboy would have to go

And 'More Bounce To the Ounce' for the Funkadelic
'Tear the Roof Off the Muthasucker', let the party rip
The funky 'Breaking Bells' took you to the 'Mardi Gras'
A slice of 'Paradise', and it was off to 'Shangri-La'
A cut of 'Space Funk' made you come down to earth
And 'Life On Mars' was the beat that gave birth

The message that I stress, the topics I address

Riding the wave that James Brown gave funk
It happened to James like it happened to me
How you think I feel to see another MC
Gettin' paid   usin' my rap style
And I'm playn' the background meanwhile
I ain't with that
You can forget that
You took my style
I'm takin' it back
I'm come back like ""Return of the Jedi""
Sucker MC's in the place that said I
Could only rock rhymes
Only rock crowds
But never rock records

Like a pony
I'm no phony
I'm the only real micaroni

What is this,amateur night at the Apollo?
Get off this stage,I'm in a rage
I'm like a lion that's been trapped in a cage
I'm the real king , rap is a jungle

Why else would you try so
Hard to paint a picture, and try to get ya
Self in my shoes,but they won't fit ya

Every time I rocked the mic,I left a
Stain in your brain that will remain
Stuck in the back of your brain till you see me
Again,respect,I come correct
The rhymes I select are nothing short of
Vernacular's pure and I can insure
Life od death with my breath,my voice is a cure
I heal life from the words I spread
I'll make a sick man rock on his death bed
Sucker MC's , I'll make your girl say ""ow""
She's jockin'
How ya like me now (x2)
It irked my nerve
When I heard
A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve
Run around town sayin' he is the best
Is that a test?
I'm not impressed
Get real,you're nothin' but a toy
Don't ya know I'll serve that boy
Just like a waiter
Hit'em with a place of
These fresh rhymes and
Make sure that he
Pays the bill,and leave him standin' still
When he's had enough,hit him with a refil
And for dessert it won't be no ice cream
I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dream
Make him feel the wrath,beat him and laugh
Then when I finish them,I'm gonna ask him
Who's the bests,and if he don't say Moe Dee
I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby
Put him on punishment just like a child,then ask
How ya like me now
Whip him good,then I'll make him sweat

But if we ever did
How could you beat me

Even scared to meet me

There's more on the menu
But relax 'cos I'm so far in you

Cars electrons rollin' in patterns

Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vaction
I came to roam
The land I own
And stand alone on the microphone
Daddy's home
Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace
Start the race
I'm coming in first

I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture

I have to slap ya

So trapped in the rap
You'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time
I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect
And it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work
Like a boxer
Train the brain and aim
To out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya
So hard it stops ya
Dead in your tracks
So power packed
Before you can react
You're flat on your back
Down for the count
Get up and dismount
Cause I'm coming
With an endless amount
Of words in a hurry
Like a flurry
A collage to camouflage
The power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote
I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote
Rhymes at a level
So you can't relate
Unless you're intelligent
So stay awake
Sleepwalkers
Slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil
Rhymes in its highest form
I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up
A few casualties but so what
If you're slow
You blow
You know you go
I flow
I throw all pro
I go to work
I go to work
To say rap is not work
Is ludicrous
Whoever said it
Must be new to this
When you hear me
You'll compare me
To a prophet for profit
Not merely
Putting words together for
Recreation
Each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation
I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work
I go to work
I go to work

And I just can't lose
An emcee with a fuse
When it's lit I hit
With the lyrical wit
Of a scientist
Tryin' this
Sugar coated
Rhyme loaded
With gunpowder
Now see how the
Crowd will yell louder
Now the
Rhyme is dropped
You hear a pop
You think it's a shot
But you just can't stop
Your heart vibrates
At my rate
So why wait
I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado winds start gustin'
Rhymes unload reload and explode
Riding on the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast outlast f- the press
When I hit it's like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
Cause when I go I go for broke
Yo I'm on the hyped tip
I get on the mic with
Tunnel vision
Cause I'm mic whipped
Strung from the lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes
That come from
A zone that's hidden
And forbidden
If any man enters
Good riddance
Cause a mortal mind
Is just no contest
The rhyme zone
Is my conquest
The Twilight Zone
Will seem like child's play
Am I a genius
I'll say
I'm so cool
And yet so hyped
When I'm on the mic
It's something like
World War II
Remember Pearl Harbor
Fireworks
But don't bother
To run for cover
You don't escape
On record
Compact disc or tape
Once you play it
The fuse is lit
An explosion
You gettin' hit
Rhythmic prophecies
Visions visions I forsee
Me blowin' up in your face
Now stop to see
Smoke fumes
In the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room
Cause I went boom
I'll light the sky
Like Halley's Comet
When it comes to rap
I'm it
I'm blowin' up
I'm blowin' up

Adults teenagers adolescents and babies

Because I said I was and always was
The baddest rapper on the mic and I proved it does
Make a difference
On the way you think you syn-
Cronize the wise tries
To overcome the dumb the drum
Beats a pattern that turns into
A catalyst that'll just
Grab your ear you had to hear

Get tense and wince
Cause I'll make a skeptic
Look epileptic
Shake and brake like the Holy Ghost connected

Minds in limbo
You resemble
A clone of Jim Jones as them bones tremble
Shakin' like a leaf in disbelief
No chatterin' teeth
Can cease pity or grief
I got you flipping like a burger
Head spinning like a top
Weak at the knees
And you're about to drop
You can't find your heart
You need a warrant to search
Get off your knees
Boy this ain't church
You can pray if you wanna pray
Say what you wanna say
Did you forget you was ambiguous
You're gonna pay
For doubting my rhyme
You better freeze your thought

If you got caught
I taught
Lessons for second-guessing
Reroute doubt
I reprogram and deprogram about

(Moe Dee!) yes, I'm the man
I am the flyest, cleanest, baddest, meanest
Rapper that walks the streets
My rhymes are always on point
Smooth as an ointment
I mitigate any beat
I'll take you where I wanna go
I sound slick when I kick it on a slow tempo
And if you ask if there's someone better than Moe
Like Luther Vandross, they'll say, 'don't you know?
Really, really, really don't you know?'
Cause I'm a real rap warrior, Elite Astoria
I'll take on 104 of ya
Highest paid rappers if they put up the plucks
And I'll prove that they're all ducks
Cause I don't care nothin 'bout your money and gold
Don't wanna hear about how many recrods you sold
Cause none of that don't mean nothin to me
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee
What are you senile, have you lost your mind?
I'm the greatest rapper of all time
If they had a rapper's hall of fame, bein that it's all a game
I might not be down, because some rappers got a name
From screamin and yellin with hot records sellin
But your rhymes are smellin, that's why I'm tellin
You, when I go, homeboy, I'm gone
Cause I'm better but don't get me wrong
There is no disrespect meant, my only intent
Is to get some of that cold cash to spend
Consider rappin as a competitive sport
And we're all enemies on the court
But when the game is over I'll shake your hand
Give ya a pound, cause you're still my man
But if you put both of us in front of a mic stand
Homeboy, it's a new game plan
Cause I gotta disrespect ya, try to disconnect ya
Break you down like a clown cause I'm an intellect, ya
Bird brain rappers I call hip-happers
Not hip-hoppers, cause y'all just happen to
Be on a mic so you can hear your voice
But your rhymes is Dunkenheins, soft and moist
Some rappers are too hard and others too soft
But I'm perfect, I just go off
Because I depict rappin consumately
Cause I'm 'the greatest' - but no Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee
Don't piss me, I know you miss me
So now you think I fell off? Don't diss me
Just use some innovation and close your eyes
And visualize us on the Enterprise
And set all coordinates on the subordinate
Rappers, beam em up, take their minds and broaden it
Set em back to Earth and watch the network
Multiply by mega-millions, you witness a burst
Of a new society, rappers with variety
So much prestige, flair and notoriety
Michael and Prince would seem like small figures
It's hard to believe but think about it, it figures
I personify perfection and my mic is a tool
I make another rapper feel small as a molecule
There's no race no contest, I'll never have to jostle
They're small time, to them I am collossal
I'm a gladiator with the image of a god
I'm powerful but camouflaged
Like Moses had the power to separate the sea
I by the power invested in me
Put words in rhythm, recite em as poem
Put em on records to display em and show em
To an entourage of fiends who are also loyal
Who through their eyes are seeing me as the royal
King that feed the hungry souls
That starve for excitement ????
The Ice Man cometh, Kool Moe Dee
The messiah is rated on a higher marquee
I be a god, apex of the hip-hop cult
I'm the leader rhyme breeder, yes, I am the ult-
imate idolized figure, there's not a name bigger
Than Kool Moe Dee cause no one has the vigour
That I possess and that's cause I
Really feel that I'm the best, so I personify
Rap to the fullest, I totally perplex
The majority of rappers and they turn out vexed
The other competition because of my position
I don't stop rockin under no condition
I rock non-stop but don't ever fatigue
And many experts in the busines are so intrigued
That they begin to draw conclusion, some askin questions
Is it possible to rock by the power of suggestion?
Well that depends totally on the source of power
And if it's your brain, the answer's of course cause I'm a
Auto-hypnotic, reverse-pschotic
That'll make you feel, if you want it I got it
Every second you spend with me
You know you feel that this is the place to be
Because I depict rappin consumately
I'm 'the greatest' - but not Ali
I'm Kool Moe Dee

I'm gone
Up up up and away
And I'm on
A higher plane
With a brain
With a flame
Feel the fire
Desire the same
Knowledge and wisdom
And understanding
Possessed by gods
Transferred to man in
A script of a book
A scripture that looks
Like a Biblical writing
Inviting a hook
Of a song sing along with a strong
Subliminal
Message divesting all men from
Criminal
Acts of the Devil
Revealed and reveled
Designed to recline the mind to lower level
With no spiritual level
Read the Holy Koran
Or the Bible
Because it's liable
To be a revival
For the weak who seek power it'll bring
Infallible power
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
Who wants some
come get it
A battle is a test of wits
And I'm witted
Hard beats a torch
And I lit it
Stop the music
Alright hit it
Now that it feels good
I'm heating up
I feed off knowledge
And can't get enough
Knowledge is infinite
Suckers ain't into it
Ignorance is bliss
And they're kin to it
Party and dance
And don't ever glance
At a book or look
For their mind to advance
Caught in a rut
Chasing butt
Trying to get a dollar
Or trying to get a nut
Evil feeds
Off a source of apathy
Weak in the mind
And of course you have to be
Less than a man
More like a thing
No knowledge you're nothin'
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My rhymes make
A meak mind anorexic
You can't hang without slang
So eject it
I've selected
Rhymes for records
To affect the effect
Of the rhyme that left
Hangin' like a pound
That came down
But you're hangin' the brain
So your brain's hell-bound
Lost and found
By the serpent's sound
What you don't know
Can't hurt that's profound
Or absurd
A better word
An ingnorant fool
Is a real cool nerd
Pockets are fat
With an empty head
Got a little fame and a name
And you're brain dead
You count dollars
So ya think ya in
What good is knowing how to count
If you don't know when
And history today
And it will equal the future
Repetitive mistakes
Cause the brain ain't acute ya
Need knowledge
To understand
The concept of sacrifice
But man don't understand
So we have to fight
War
Killing people we never
Saw before
Most don't eden know
What they're killin' for
Following rulers
Instead of the prophets
The wicked can rule ya
But the knowledge can stop it
Souls can't be controlled
It's a spiritual thing
But you got the knowledge
Knowledge is king
Knowledge
My knowledge comes
From a spiritual force
Stonger than any
Earthly source
Propaganda
Hype or slander
I won't believe the hype
I understand the
Media dictates
The mind and rotates
The way you think
And syncopates slow pace
Brains
Can't maintain
Acertain
Insipid inane crass rain
Insane lame
Traditions
All praise fame
Positions
Want to be a star
Drive a big car
Live bourgeios
Ane won't know who you are
Lost in the source
And praising the dollar
Whether your faith is
Christ or Allah
The knowledge of God
Will teach one thing
The dollar is moot
Knowledge is king

You high strung bum come and get done

My lyrical beatdown will leave ya in a coma
'Cause you can't hang without a high school diploma

Somebody buy him a heart 'cause he's petro
Take you're whipping like a man brother let go
No apologies, tears of violence
Get your black suits 'cause I ain't smiling
I'm shooting the gift of gab, brother you're ripped in half
Soon as the mic is past, you won't live to laugh
If there's laughter, I'll get the last one
You loafed on the lyrics and you caught a bad one
So who's got no style, look at your profile
You can't dance, can't dress and you're so foul
Still wearing played out 4 finger rings
Played out fat gold chains and things
You changed your look now change your gameplan
Trying to dress but you still wear name brand
Brother, you look crazy weak
And it gets worse when we hear you speak
So you ain't got a chance in hell
You'll be known as the late LL
The man who lost one, one too often
Came wit a soft one and went to his coffin
A close casket they won't show ya
When I finish, you're mama won't know ya
'Cause I'm a rip you limb from limb
You tombstone read he had no win
So RIP, Rest in peace, rip 'em
D.I.D., dead indeed, did 'em
A H-I-T, hitman, so whatcha hit 'em wit

If mama said knock me out, come do it
You can't win and that (record scratch) knew it
I'm a send you home in a body bag
Wit the mic in your throat and a jock for a gag
You're out of here, over, finished, all in
And Marly marl can't save you from fallin
'Cause as soon as you came back what did you do
To the break of dawn, another dumb move
You can't go hard, you're just so-so Todd
I'm that type of guy, oh my God
It's gets no rougher comes no weaker
marly hooked the beats so now you need a
Writer to bring you back from hell
Because I'm a rock up L
Low life loser, life like luna
Lafidasical, lispless luna
Tic liver lifeless, living likeness
Lusting longing lyrics like this
Little league, lard larsonist liar
Label ledger, left the leper liar
Bull, lull, lateral learning
Laps language latent lurking
Language, language, local logo
Light laboring, limited local
Now LL's a laughing stock
'Cause I bit that ass to the last stop
I watched you fall like Hitler fell
And now you're down to a broken L
You're records ain't hot and you're shows don't sell
Yo, tell 'em how you fell L, hard as hell
You came back and you thought you had me
But think about it, whos' your daddy
Kill 'em... Big daddy, I don't want none...

1986 - return of the horror flicks
More deadly than _The Omen_, a killer and a showman
Like the devil in _The Excorcist_
But this flick can cause a heart attack
Cause it's more than action-packed
It's alive and killin and the star is a villain
And his name is Monster Crack
The crack monster
He talks to ya like he's alive
And when he talks like bees to a hive
The people come runnin, the older and the young'in
The place he lives in is the house they hung in
He wants your money, only your money
He'll make you feel good for a real fast twenty
The bill is passed and the dollars go fast
The feeling is high but the high don't last
Long enough for you to even read a paper
But you still thirst and hunger for the vapor
Although he is an animate, he'll make you feel
That he can breathe, think, talk and bleed for real
You should stay away cause all he's about
Is just makin you broke and stringin you out
It only takes one kiss and a deep, deep breath
Then you're hooked for life cause it's the kiss of death
Like savoir-faire he's everywhere
He'll hook an innocent baby cause he don't care
He loves to eat, girls and boys, and he's nothin but poison
The biggest ????? of Michael Jackson he's makin noise in
The streets he's notorious, to pushers he's glorious
To girls he's a pimp cause he turns em to the whoriest
Materialistic nymphomaniacs
That'll do anything for Monster Crack
Give away her body, steal from her brother
Fight her father or sell her mother
Cause when you're possessed by Crack, God bless
Your soul, cause he'll take the rest
The power of the mind should not be wasted
But the agony of defeat is always tasted
By those who chose to willingly oppose
??????? instead they follow their nose
And the more you get, the more you want
You're killin your brain out, so later on it'll haunt
You you become insatiable, you can't get enough
When your money gets low, things really get rough
It's your only objective, you lose all perspective
On life, you're obsessed, possessed and defective
Losin weight and disappearin but still perseverin
Your body tells you no, but all you're hearin
Is the crack talk
In South Africa many a brother died
Tryin to fight back against apartheid
Bombs are flying, people are dying
Terrorists terrorizing and the whole world's trying
To prevent another war, but I got a surprise
There's already - one right before your eyes
And we're nowhere near, the end this is only the beginning
Until this point the Crack has been winning
Weakening hearts, corrupting minds
A stone cold killer, very easy to find
And once he's caught by the law, he can't go to jail
Cause he's nothin but a little piece of matter for sale
Usin people like pawns in the game of chess
And he is the king, more powerful than the rest

If you're ever in a fight and you're beating one of us
Break out, before you get bumrushed
At the...
The wild wild west (repeat 16x)
I'm talking about Nazareth, B.O., Tony and Milton
Mike Mike Sluggo and Mike Chillion
D.O.B., Reggie B, and Sidney
Dana B, Derrick B, Sean B, and don't forget
Big Hank, Don Ice and Sire Rock
God bless Peter Wax, Chuck Chuck, and Po Rock
El Dorado George way back in the day
Had all the brothers on the hill talking this way
They said, ""God, have mercy L.A.
Sunshine,"" and my DJ
Easy Lee, are from aroud the way
Jock Jock, Philly Phil, Don D always
But they're chillin, Keith Keith, KV

We fight with our hands and nobody's a punk!

Pain relievers won't relieve ya
Suicide won't do it either
Even after I cremate you

Bring you back for another round

An emcee with a fuse
When it's lit I hit
With the lyrical wit
Of a scientist
Tryin' this
Sugar coated
Rhyme loaded
With gunpowder
Now see how the
Crowd will yell louder
Now the
Rhyme is dropped
You hear a pop
You think it's a shot
But you just can't stop
Your heart vibrates
At my rate
So why wait
I hate to be irate
Anger causes rhyme combustion
Like a tornado winds start gustin'
Rhymes unload reload and explode
Riding on the same wave Malcolm X rode
On a higher level cause I left the rest
Outcast outlast f- the press
When I hit it's like a bulldozer
Boom and there goes ya
Whole world up in smoke
Cause when I go I go for broke
Yo I'm on the hyped tip
I get on the mic with
Tunnel vision
Cause I'm mic whipped
Strung from the lung to tongue
I breathe rhymes
That come from
A zone that's hidden
And forbidden
If any man enters
Good riddance
Cause a mortal mind
Is just no contest
The rhyme zone
Is my conquest
The Twilight Zone
Will seem like child's play
Am I a genius
I'll say
I'm so cool
And yet so hyped
When I'm on the mic
It's something like
World War II
Remember Pearl Harbor
Fireworks
But don't bother
To run for cover
You don't escape
On record
Compact disc or tape
Once you play it
The fuse is lit
An explosion
You gettin' hit
Rhythmic prophecies
Visions visions I forsee
Me blowin' up in your face
Now stop to see
Smoke fumes
In the shape of a mushroom
Cloud the room
Cause I went boom
I'll light the sky
Like Halley's Comet
When it comes to rap
I'm it

When this party is over, there'll be no more rappin
You and I can spread out, and anything can happen
If the party's not enough, and you still think you're ready
You ain't gotta clap your hands and dance, but we can still rock steady

And if you really rock your body, we ain't even gotta converse
After the party, all I wanna do is come over
And tell you that I want you
And if you don't wanna go, just listen to the drums
Feel the beat - and it'll make you come
And don't try to front, cause I'll call your bluff
Don't kick me no bass, cause I got enough
Just let the music keep flowin, watch your head start goin

Cause I'm a super lover, undercover
Watch your sister and your mother
Scream, dream, cream, kick, bite and fight each other
I make em drool, cause I'm so cool
I got the tool to rule, and I guarantee you'll
Encounter a night like never before
If you ever walk through my party doors
You come over and over, again and again
And next time you'll bring a friend

With my feet and my hands
And all the work I did
Was for the other man
We demand a chance
To do things for ourselves
We're tired of beating our heads against the wall
And workin for someone else

And sing this song one more time

It's gonna be music to your ear
You have no fear
Cause God is here
As the righteous get it in gear
And the wicked step to the rear
You're outta here
Feel the power in the rhythm
As our souls move vocally
Come together in a montage
A collage of harmony
Spirits manifest in our voices
As our hearts provide the beat
For a source of inspiration
When we speak in unity
Though it seems like it's a dream
This is as real as it gets
Controlling your environment
Through chanting your concept
Breathing life into lyrics
You can hear it, loud and clear
You can almost see the spirit
From vibrations that you hear
I'm a brother of color descent
From the mother continent
And I been sent with the intent
To rectify the hell-bent
From the line of the devine
Of those way before my time
Like a star I'm chosen to shine
As the God of Rhythm and Rhyme
Comin strictly from an Afrocentric point of view
I talk to you in a tongue that relates to the young
And if you can't relate, it ain't meant for you
This is strictly for the restoration of pride and enterprise
Esoteric knowledge - essential to our rise

Driving down the boulevard
Turn the corner
Like I wanna be chilin' hard
The screen is set
For me to get wet
Cause it wouldn't be right
If the ladies didn't sweat
Pull the seat back
To make contact
Eye to eye
You know I ain't living like that
I wear shades
I get paid
And when it comes to girls
And cops I can't get played
Fly girls that
Used to ignore me
I pull up
And let the car speak for me
(beep beep)
Enough said
Better hop in while the light's still red
Homeboys scatter
What's the matter
( Here come the cops )
Oh yeah that again
Rather than
Beating them down
I just talk to the men
They don't understand how I've got so much cash
Then I get mad and tell them to ask
Their daughter
I bet she bought a
Kool Moe Dee tape
For her recorder
We're not always
Thieves and thugs
And what law says
We gotta sell drugs
I get paid
And I'm making a killin'
But when I come home
I just like chillin'
On the
Avenue, a-avenue (4x)
Action
That's where the stars go
On the weekend
It's like a car show
Ladies flock to jock
Cars go by them
If I'm walking and talking
They ask what ya driving
When I peep that
Same old weak rap
Ask her her language
Tell her I don't speak that
Pull out a  G
A car key and a Visa
Walk her to the car
Leave her there  see ya
She didn't want
Nothin' else but a payday
Now she's sinking
Hollering Mayday
I knew her card
Cause two days ago
I saw that same slick girl
In a broken-down Yugo
With a hustler
Layin' low
Couldn't drive his Benz
Cause the cops said so
Your homeboy got shot
In front of your crack spot
You move cause it got to hot
But not on that block
The cops are watching
Baiting and plotting
Setting you up
For the raid in the block and
When they come
You all got to go
But not Kool Moe
Cause they all know
The knot I got
Is way over their knot
But I'm working
That's why they're not
After me
They're after you
Cause I'm just chillin'
On the
Avenue, a-avenue (4x)
Homeboys wanna get paid
We can do this
the right way
You'll get money and respect
Livin' large and correct
Then come back through the neighborhood
When you look good
We all look good
Cause it's all for one
And one for all
It's got to be a better way
To get the money y'all

Like other music rap is an art
And if you wanna get the feeling, got to feel it in your heart
You need brain power, dictation
Vocabulary, articulation
Creativity and originality
Execution of a feud formality
Versatility and a voice that's loud
With the ability to take a crowd
To its apogee, and always has a
Feeling like you're havin a mental orgasm
Makin all minds come to one conclusion
You are the best and it's not an illusion
(The best)
(Rockin my beat)
(The best)
For instance
If this record was an atom, I'd be the nucleus
The center of attention, Kool Moe Dee and I'm just
Like the core of an apple, the priest of the chapel
With the mic in my hand I'm like a surgeon with a scalpel
Ready to operate the rhymes that I create
Sounds like music to your ears cause I can combinate
Bass and treble to create a level
Of highs and lows of sounds that goes
With syncopated concrete-created
Beats that meet the standard of a street credit
Gotta critique a rhyme if it's weak
You won't wanna speak if your rhymes not peak
With verbs and nouns and adjectives
Combined to make a phrase
That'll play with a beat
Stop and start, slow it down at a part
And totally amaze
The whole crowd, leave em in a state of awe
Cause I'm as perfect as a diamond without a flaw
And yes, I'm legendary, also very, very
Educated, proficient and extraordinary
In my field the other rappers yield
A knight in shining armor and the mic is my shield
In rap I'm vital, the other rappers' idol
The best mc and Moe Dee's my title
But you can call me Kool
Now when I rock instead of
Just average I'm better
Than the average man
And that's why I can
Make a real human feel like a manakin
I mean I'm cold heart ???? from the time I walk in
I'll shock ya and amaze ya
Hit ya, then I'll daze ya
Either way I'm gonna phase ya
Cause I'm sharp as a razor
When I'm rhymin to the cut
You know what?
I'm the best MC
Many imitate me
They never would admit it
They just can't get it
I rhyme like the rest
But the juice I possess
Always seems to be more
I'm a rhyme connoisseur
My taste for the beat
Is also elite
I'm the best hip-hopper from off the street
Cause when I'm rhymin on the mic I always take control
Can't another rapper touch me with a 10 ft. pole
I rhyme a 100 miles an hour
With lightning-speedin power
Make the sweetest of the sweet MC's look sour
Timber as they tower, because I devour
Any other rapper and I can prove it now or
A little bit later, cause I'm a graduator
From a rhymin alma mater, but some say alma mata
Like you say patata, I say potato
Tomato, tomata, my data's up to data
Cause somethin is the matter with those of you say dada
Could mean opposite of mama, like the kids at Wonderama
I'm very good at actin, I'm very good at drama
I confuse you with a period, colon and a coma
Cause when I'm rhymin and I take a pause
You think the rhyme is over but when you and yours
Really check out what I'm doin, then you say ooh
When they say who's the best MC to you
You'll look at me, then yoU say I know who

It's Kool Moe Dee

They took me in cause they thought I pimped
Jetted from the station back in a flash
They had nothing on me but cold cold cash
Ladies they all wanna get with

And ride shotgun

For some action
I'm hot as a tamale on fire
I need more than
A physical attraction
Cause lust is a weak desire
A woman without a good
Head on her shoulders
Is nothing but a piece of meat
For that I'll go to the butcher store
Cause I'm choosy about what I eat
The body is a mere appetizer
And the mind is the real main course
The personality is the icing on the cake
The real magnetic force
The completion of any kind of coffee
Makes my percolator perk
And once I taste the coffee
So get ready to work
All night long
How many ladies
Are deep enough
To handle a man
Like me
I mean mentally
Emotionally and physically
I like my women deep
I like 'em
Hot blooded by nature
But not promiscuous
A women who can relate to
Being spontaneous
And yet I like 'em old-fashioned
Updated with a modern day twist
A women that's a slave to passion
But know when to resist
I like a woman
That's not so public
Cause no one needs to know
And if you can respect my privacy
The forever we're good to go
All night long
Scintillating, sultry, stimulating, sexy
Super, subtle, smart, and seductive
Sensitive, serious, succulent, sensuous
Softly saying she loves this
Kind of
Mental stimulation
That's causing body heat
Visually anticipating
Making love between the sheets
Now I can't stand a groupie
But I'll always love a true fan
Someone ready to do me right
Once she knows the man
I admit I love it in public
Cause it's cool being Kool Moe Dee
But behind closed doors
I get the applause
For just being plain old me
All night long
I never like to make the first move
I'ma rapper but I don't rap
Cause when it comes to the ladies
I'm too smooth for that
I love a women with a good sense of humor
For me that is essential
Uninhibited and very deep
Someone I can really get into
And once I get into ya
I can feel if you're for real
And right is how I'll do ya
I'll give you something you can feel
It's like a romance
Right out of a storybook
Without the
Wine and candles
An encounter
You'll never forget
But don't try it
If you can't handle
All night long

One for the trouble
Two for the time
Come on, y'all, let's rock the -
( *whistle* )
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky beats, y'all
Then you rock 'n roll
Then you roll 'n rock
And they you rockin to the beat that just don't want you to stop
Cause I'm the S to the p-double o-n-y
The one MC who you can't deny
Cause I'm the baby-maker, I'm the woman-taker
I'm the cold-crushin lover, the heartbreaker
So come on, fly girls, and please don't stop
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, wanna hit the top
And young ladies, rock on
Say I was drivin down the street on a stormy night
Say up ahead there was this terrible fright
There was a big fine lady, she was crossin the street
She had a box with the disco beat
So I hit my brakes, but they're not all there
I missed the young lady by only a hair
And then I took me a look, I said, ""La-di-da-di""
A big fine girl, she had a hell of a body
Then she looked at me and then she started switchin
So I took my key out of the ignition
Got out the car and kept my mouth shut
Cause my 20-20 vision was right on her butt
I caught up with her, I said, ""You look so fine
I swear to God I wish you was mine""
She said, ""Hey boy, you're Spoonie Gee""
""That's right, honey, how did you know me?""
She said, ""Spoonie Gee, you're all the same
And everybody who disco know your name""
I said, ""Come on baby, it's not too far
We gonna take a little walk to my car""
Once we got to the car, then we sat in the seat
And then the box was rockin to the funky beat
And then I looked at her and pushed the seat back
Turned off her box and put on my 8-track
And then I started rappin without no pause
Cause my mind was just gettin in those draws
And then I got in the straw, we started do it to the beat
And started doin like this, started doin the freak
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Cause I'm a man's threat
And I'm a woman's pet
And I'm known as the mamsel's joy
And I'm a man who fights on the microphone
And who all the people enjoy, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on
Say I was breakin and freakin at a disco place
I met a fine girl, she had a pretty face
And then she took me home, you say, ""The very same night?""
The girl was on and she was outta sight
And then I got the girl for three hours straight
But I had to go to work, so I couldn't be late
I said, ""Where's your man?"" she said, ""He's in jail""
I said, ""Come on baby, cause you're tellin a tale
Cause if he comes at me and then he wants to fight
See I'ma get the man good and I'ma get him right
See I'ma roll my barrel and keep the bullets still
And when I shoot my shot, I'm gonna shoot to kill
Cause I'm the Spoonie-Spoon, I don't mess around
I drop a man where he stand right into the ground
You say from Africa to France, say to Germany
Because you can't get a man tryin to mess with me
Cause I'm a smooth talker, I'm the midnight stalker
I'm the image of the man they call the J.D. Walker
If you're gonna be my girl, just come along
And just clap your hands to my funky song
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't gamble neither
And most people call me a woman pleaser
Cause I keep their phone numbers on the shelf
I go to make love, and then keep it to myself
So no one's gonna know what I'm doin to you
Not your sister, brother, niece, nor your mother, father too""
And take that y'all
And don't stop
You keep on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Young ladies rock on
Fly guys
What a big surprise
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, don't take no mess
>From the north, the south, from east or west
Cause everybody knows MC Spoonie Gee's the best
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock, rock, y'all and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
And then you rock and roll
And then you roll and rock
And then you rock to the beat that just don't wantcha to stop
Cause I'm the S to the p-double o-n-y g
I'm talkin about me, MC Spoonie Gee
Rock on, y'all
And don't stop

Rock on and on and on and on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
Don't stop the funky beat till the break of dawn
Young ladies
Young ladies
Cause I'm the cool-crushin lover, goes on to supreme
And when it comes to fine girls I'm like a lovin machine
It comes to makin love, I do the best I can
Cause I'm known from coast to coast as the sixty-minute man
It comes to makin face, I got the macho class
I have all the fly girls shakin their ass
So for all you fly girls who wanna be loved
Check me out, cause I'm the highest above
I'm gonna call you up and give you an invitation
So you can see the way Spoonie Gee rocks the nation
One time, for the mind, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Funky freaks, y'all
Yo go hip - hop - a hip-hip a hop
And then you're rockin to the hip, and then you're rockin the hop
And then you on and on and on and on
The beat don't stop until the freaks are gone
And rock on y'all, and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
And for you sucker-sucker dudes who commit a crime
You wanna do bad, but don't do the time
I say you wanna be dissed and then you wanna be a crook
You find a old lady, take her pocketbook
And then you steal your mother's borrowed money on the sly
You can run, but you can't hide
When the cops crashed through, your face turned pale
I'ma tell you a little story about the jail
Cause see, in jail there's a game and it's called survival
And they run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and cannot do
But if you go to jail, watch yours for a crew
Cause when you go in the shower, he's pullin his meat
And he's lookin at you and say you look real sweet
And at first there was one, now ten walked in
Now how in the hell did you expect to win?
I said you better look alive, not like you take dope
And please my brother, don't drop the soap
And if you get out the bathroom, and you're alive
Just remember only a man can survive
In jail of course, cause when you're doin 15 years
You got no ??????, you just have a warden
????? no ???? a corner
?????
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to shill shot
Like a lime to a lemon and a lemon to a lime
I keep the funky beat, I say I pass the time
And like lemon and lime and like a lime to a lemon
A MC could attract all the women
Cause I'm Spoonie Gee, and I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
So just clap your hands and just stomp your feet
And just rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
To the funky, funky, funky, funky beat
The beat that makes you get up and pat your feet
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock on, y'all
Till the break of dawn
I say you do the Spank or the Patty Duke
Either one you want, you gotta get up and do
The rock-rock and you don't stop
I say I jumped the turnstyle for summer day
And then I seen the guy, and then I fled away
And then he pulled his gun, but he did not shoot
So come on everybody, let's Patty Duke
Cause I'm livin well, and I'm ready to dance
Come on girl, let me show my romance
I'll let you see the way how I rock the mic
Cause I know damn well that I could rock all night
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on, y'all
You go rock and roll
And then you roll and rock..

(Yeah)
(With your badself)
Hit man
[ VERSE 1 ]
Not to kick you down, but he's known all over town
Keeps two or three pretty women around
Stuff you pop out your mouth he ain't takin
He got the dudes on the avenue shakin
Livin on the hill he keeps up buildin and will
Please understand, this man can kill at will
One purpose, he know it's a payday - hey
Now I'm not one for talkin, but there he is, the hit man
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
[ VERSE 2 ]
Always walkin alone in the street through an alley
He has no one he can call old pal of mine
But he's a man, he uses skill
You're the target, aim, shoot, and you better believe he will
If he's heated, so why don't you beat it
You got no car, then brotherman, feet it
Get out the way and hopefully stay
And once you get there, on your knees and pray
Cause you never know you might see him again
And then they'll have to call your next akin
What a way to go, because of what you didn't know
And after all this you may say 'So
What?' What? I'ma tell you somethin, please listen
Once you're gone, ain't nothin you could be missin
But while you're livin, there's a lot to enjoy
Don't play with him, he ain't no toy
There he is: the hit man
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
You don't understand
Hit man
Take it down
[ VERSE 3 ]
Another truck was robbed, they called him for the job
This is his livin, brotherman, not his hobby
Well anyway, he had to stop them
Well, as we say Uptown: just lay or drop them
Hang in the street day and night just because
To get a lead on who it was
He asks one brother, and then another
But in the end only to discover
>From all the different leads he picked up
That it was his best friend who did the stick-up
Thought real deep: I have to put him to sleep
His reputation he had to keep
A very cool brother with funny ways
He chilled on the roof four nights and three days
And it bothered me, so I asked him this
He said, ""When I'm high, I don't miss
I'm a hit man""
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
Cause I'm a hit man
[ VERSE 4 ]
A soft-spoken guy, and that's no lie
I know it's hard to believe, so please try
Cause if you underestimate him it'll be doomsday for you
So tell the sister at the church to pray for you
So that you never ever make the mistake
Cause if you do, just remember your life he'll take
On a far journey with no way back
And no mercy, he don't give no slack
Cause he's a hit man
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
Hit man
He's a hit man

(You ain't just a fool

You give her all your money and all of your time
And at the end of the week you ain't got one dime
To spend; you say you love her, she makes you feel young
But this only proves one thing: that you's a dumb-dumb
'Age's just a number', now gimme a break
She's only 16 and you're 68
Mistake, and plus you're married till death do us part
Soon as you see a young lady, you're ready to start
Flirtin, keep late hours at home and on the telephone
Talkin to the girl while you think she's alone
But she's not, she's with another guy
And if you knew, you'd die

Because you'll never be able to compete with the other guy
Cause you're much too old, he's much younger
To her you're like drizzling rain, but he's thunder
Now you tell me, who do you think she'll choose
I bet you nine times out of ten you lose
But you can win your wife cause she'll be with you for a lifetime
But you don't want that, you rather ride a baby
Why don't you go home and eat some gravy train
That's dog food, that's what you deserve
If it was my daughter, brother, you would get served
There's no excuse, cause as a man you can fight that
Thank my Heavenly Father I ain't like that

Now you told the girl to meet you at a disco spot
You dyed your hair and moustache to get a better shot
When you walked through the door, thought you was cool
Meanwhile behind your back she's callin you a fool
Wearin those old clothes that's older than me
You see, she wanted to laugh, you just couldn't see it
She said, ""I'm leavin for business, meet me at my place""
You gave her 50 dollars and a 10 dollar chase
See, you waited all night, preferably into the morning
She came in all rubbled, stretchin and yawnin
You said, ""I need some lovin,"" she said, ""It's too soon
But here's a pillow, so you can sleep in the living room""

So dig this, when I'm rappin people start clappin
Get on the dancefloor, and things just start happen

Now I've got a question, do you mind if I ask?

Now it makes no difference if the people start jumpin

And this beat is dope, now did you get that, Jack?
So get with it, don't quit it, you hear my rhyme, forget it

Are you done? You better quit

People on the outside just hangin
Around, for what? To hear the Spoonie Gee sound
To move, to have fun, to get on down
Cause I'm serious, I don't have no time for playin
So listen to my music, as well as what I'm sayin
The music is a part, and the words are too
Together they make you do what you came to
You wanna finger-pop? Well, go head, I won't stop you
Put some music in rap, and then rock you
Cause that's what y'all came here for
But if you didn't, there's the door
Well?

Well let's get this straight, there's no contest
So now you people know don't have to guess
I'm not tha king of rap, not lord, not prince
I was a young kid rapper that I've been rapping ever since
I was just a young bub, I didn't care what mc's did
Before ??? cause I'm the godfather
I caught silly young ladies, two just chilled
They never said no to me - always say that they will do
Whenever I want them to - when I confront them to
Watch where ya're walkin', or just might browl to
I never rule them, I only school them
But if they ever try to fool me
That's when I foo them
I'm tha godfather
Long time to be chillin', just to make money
I rapped on stage, check my voice for your honey
Cause I'm rappin', and I'm not stoppin'
MC baby, who love stand hip-hopin'
so don't tease me, just kiss me
If ya already had a pimp, ya gonna miss me
I'm just a brother so what's upsaid
Cause it's a pretty ladies, I mean top like this
Ya know I'm the godfather
They say that I'm an mc some say that I'm a proud
I changed my style people just didn't know it yet
I had to tell them I might kill them
you mess with me I'm sick your ass then swell them
Woah like on the phone, I'm 'bout to take charge
At the station for the new car in my garage
They want to cruise me, they don't move me
See my bankroll they want to try to use me
But I'm no fool never losin' my cool
But for me to darkness I make the young ladies drool
I'm not braggin' tellin' you what I'm about
Young ladies no babies and marriage bout
But if you insist you can't convince your house are mine
Night or day we'll be fine
So let's get with it, so that I can't hit it
After an hour or two me and you can just quit it
I'm the godfather
There's no need to be smokin' when the fire is out
So take your hand off your hip and let's work out
No leanin' on the wall no standin' around
So are you ready (for what ?!) for the beat in me now
Because people can't see me so people want to be me
Pretty young ladies want L Blue Spoon
The beat so fair so ate 9 o'clock in the morning
If they're playin' they'll call the cops cause I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather
You got rockin' beat no stoppin' beat
Some roars have things pumpin' beat
All the rest of my time Jerry knows my side
I'm so dip that's why I keep all girls in your mind
I'm not dedicate this at the top of this
Say cool you bring, don't break the rules if you wanna get this
Respect me brother rapper recorded on the show
Ya could stare, cause I don't care it's just long you know
I'm the godfather
Now you be jumpin' your heart will be thumpin
Intendin' rappin', swearin' hip hopin'
Off your face, all know the place
Easely scatty standin' in pace
Don't stand around, your face road in my clan
This is the season no prisonner can't get down
So get all the world, let's up these words
Boogie down to the beat just give it to y'all
No need to get hot money dispenser
You can't have a good time cause it's so danger

So if you dare, please, be ready to rock
Yes, the music is on just like popcorn
So don't hold back, because the party is packed
And this beat is dope, now did you get that, Jack?
So get with it, don't quit it, you hear my rhyme, forget it
You're tryina be me, Spoonie Gee, just forget it
Cause I'm the only one that can do it this way
When you see me at a party you will always say
""Yeah, that's Spoonie Gee"", and your girls say, ""Not hardly""
So what's your name, baby, did you come here to party?
(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party?)  (3x)
(Did you come)
Let's break it down
[ VERSE 3 ]
Here we go now, dance, you're gonna sweat
But be prepared, because we're nowhere finished yet
I'm rockin, and I'm rollin
The mic is in my hand, and I'm the one that's controllin
Are you done? You better quit
And let me rap a little bit
Cause this is a new hit that I'm makin
And other records I'm breakin
So
(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party)  (3x)
[ VERSE 4 ]
Now the beat is swingin, I'm rappin, not singin
People on the outside just hangin
Around, for what? To hear the Spoonie Gee sound
To move, to have fun, to get on down
Cause I'm serious, I don't have no time for playin
So listen to my music, as well as what I'm sayin
The music is a part, and the words are too
Together they make you do what you came to
You wanna finger-pop? Well, go head, I won't stop you
Put some music in rap, and then rock you
Cause that's what y'all came here for
But if you didn't, there's the door
Well?
(Did you come to party?)
(Did you come to party-party?)  (7x)
This beat is dope  (3x)
Best believe it

[ VERSE 1 ]
Not to kick you down, but he's known all over town
Keeps two or three pretty women around
Stuff you pop out your mouth he ain't takin
He got the dudes on the avenue shakin
Livin on the hill he keeps up buildin and will
Please understand, this man can kill at will
One purpose, he know it's a payday - hey
Now I'm not one for talkin, but there he is, the hit man
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
[ VERSE 2 ]
Always walkin alone in the street through an alley
He has no one he can call old pal of mine
But he's a man, he uses skill
You're the target, aim, shoot, and you better believe he will
If he's heated, so why don't you beat it
You got no car, then brotherman, feet it
Get out the way and hopefully stay
And once you get there, on your knees and pray
Cause you never know you might see him again
And then they'll have to call your next akin
What a way to go, because of what you didn't know
And after all this you may say 'So
What?' What? I'ma tell you somethin, please listen
Once you're gone, ain't nothin you could be missin
But while you're livin, there's a lot to enjoy
Don't play with him, he ain't no toy
There he is: the hit man
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
You don't understand
Hit man
Take it down
[ VERSE 3 ]
Another truck was robbed, they called him for the job
This is his livin, brotherman, not his hobby
Well anyway, he had to stop them
Well, as we say Uptown: just lay or drop them
Hang in the street day and night just because
To get a lead on who it was
He asks one brother, and then another
But in the end only to discover
>From all the different leads he picked up
That it was his best friend who did the stick-up
Thought real deep: I have to put him to sleep
His reputation he had to keep
A very cool brother with funny ways
He chilled on the roof four nights and three days
And it bothered me, so I asked him this
He said, ""When I'm high, I don't miss
I'm a hit man""
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
Cause I'm a hit man
[ VERSE 4 ]
A soft-spoken guy, and that's no lie
I know it's hard to believe, so please try
Cause if you underestimate him it'll be doomsday for you
So tell the sister at the church to pray for you
So that you never ever make the mistake
Cause if you do, just remember your life he'll take
On a far journey with no way back
And no mercy, he don't give no slack
Cause he's a hit man
(Children grow and women produce
And men go work and some go stealin
Everyone's got to make a livin)
Hit man
He's a hit man

Now my girl ain't callin, yet she ain't fallin
I went to the park with the boys and was ballin
And on the bench some other fellas was chillin
Puffin and smokin and tootin and illin
She breaks my heart and tears it all apart, it
Makes me so mad, I feel like startin
A fight, I want her bad, I need her so much
I'm in love, and I'm all shook up
She says she wants to keep me
But yet she's tryin to cheat me
Whatever I had, the girl's always tryin to beat me

Feel so good, it's like heaven she takes me
Don't know what I'ma do, but I'ma get it done
She's got me so mad, cause she keeps me on the run
She has an attitude, she can be nice when she wanna
But you can bet your bottom-dollar this girl ain't gonna
Make me or break me, she might shake me
But all she do is just make me
Mad, she wants to boss me, and yet she cost me
But in the end she'll say that she lost me

Now
I'm gonna tell you a little story 'bout a man I like
He goes by the name of Mighty Mike
Tyson is his name, boxing is his game
Well, he's the greatest, goin straight to the Hall of Fame
He don't float like a butterfly or sting like a bee
But he's the hardest damn puncher you'll ever see
He don't stick and move, he don't weave and bob
But there ain't a heavyweight that can do his job
He do damage to your body, do work on your head
You wind up flat on your back like the canvas was your bed
Well, you can dance around, or you can go toe to toe
But if you fight Mighty Mike, he's gonna lay you low
Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)
Well, he's the king of the ring, knows how to do that thing
And he'll knock your butt out just like it ain't no thing
He'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well I'm takin bets, 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered
Mighty Mike
(Mighty mighty)
Now my friends keep tellin me, my girl keeps jealin me
She seen Mike fight and got excited, then fell on me
Now I don't know what it is, but maybe you do
When Mike fights, it's just like voodoo
No matter what you do, you'll always lose
I'm not the preacher, but I've got some good news
About Mike
(Mighty mighty)
Mighty Mike
(Ladies and gentlemen
The undefeated
Undisputed
Heavyweight
Champion of the world
Iron Mike Tyson)
He's very soft spoken, but the man hits hard
Don't sleep on him and don't drop your guard
Cause he'll pop you, stop you, then he'll drop you
You wanna know who's gonna win? Sure not you
Well, I'm takin bets 10 and above
I haven't lost a bet yet ever since I discovered
Mighty Mike
(Mighty might)
Go put your best dress on, girl, and look real pretty
Tonight Mike's fightin at Atlantic City
Got my white Tux on, chauffeur's outside
A Caddy stretch limo's gonna be our ride
When we get to the fight, well, we won't be beat
As we watch Mike fight from the front row seats
Now I can't look into the future, I can't tell how long
The fight will go, but this I know, and I won't be wrong
When the bell rings and the deal goes down
Mighty Mike will still be wearin his champion's crown
He's Mighty Mike

(My-my-my girl)
Well, let me tell you 'bout a girl who's finer than fine
She used to be somebody else's, now she's mine
All the fellas said, ""Spoonie, don't mess with that""
But it's been a year, and I still go by to see her
It ain't the perfume, well, it's just her
She got the greatest respect for me
She calls me Mr. Gee
And I reply, so fella, hey
No need to try, so you might as well stay away
You spend your money on my girl winin dinin
You're never gettin her back, so ain't no sense in me lyin
To you, what I'ma do? Well, our star did not tell
I took her out one night and I rocked her well
Now she's my girl
Now she's my only girl and you know that's true
But personally it was the right thing to do
To her, cause she was so fine and I was so kind
That when I asked the young lady, she said she didn't mind
Doin what I want, as long as it felt good
Well, you know without a doubt I did the best I could
When I wanted to leave, she wouldn't let me out
For some unknown reason told her friends all about
Me, she even said I was the best she had
But it could not be, if you didn't treat her bad-
ly now you pretend that you love her so
Tell my friends that you want the girl back, but no
Way, gave her diamonds, I gave her pearls
And not to mention that I gave her my love
And that's why she's my girl
Now I'm the type of guy to make a girl feel good
And in return the young lady does the same, well should-
n't she? One hand washes the other, both wash the face
And as a matter of fact she's tas-
ty, keeps my feelin like I never did before
My favorite words to the girl is 'more
please', keeps me smilin, she keeps me feelin
Man, so good, if I was sick, she'd be my healin
My friend, my girl, soon to be my wife
And then she'll be mine for a life-
Time, for now she's my girl
Now sometimes we fuss, sometimes we fight
But we make everything alright before night-
time, no fussin, no time for fightin
There's plenty good lovin, she's so excitin
She's got me doin things that I never did
Like flushin that stuff like a little kid
But no bedtime stories like Jack & Jill
Takes two to get a pail of water, be for real
If I climb any mountain, it'll be for fun
Not in order to get water, cause to me that's dumb
Without a stop I reach the top, and I won't fall down
Only to get busy if a girl's around
Now that I told you all about my girl
As you can see MC Spoonie Gee's the only one can do it
You say 'what?' well, I say satisfy
That pretty young lady, if you don't believe me try
It, with my girl

Cause I'm the baby-maker, I'm the woman-taker
I'm the cold-crushin lover, the heartbreaker
So come on, fly girls, and please don't stop
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, wanna hit the top
And young ladies, rock on
Say I was drivin down the street on a stormy night
Say up ahead there was this terrible fright
There was a big fine lady, she was crossin the street
She had a box with the disco beat
So I hit my brakes, but they're not all there
I missed the young lady by only a hair
And then I took me a look, I said, ""La-di-da-di""
A big fine girl, she had a hell of a body
Then she looked at me and then she started switchin
So I took my key out of the ignition
Got out the car and kept my mouth shut
Cause my 20-20 vision was right on her butt
I caught up with her, I said, ""You look so fine
I swear to God I wish you was mine""
She said, ""Hey boy, you're Spoonie Gee""
""That's right, honey, how did you know me?""
She said, ""Spoonie Gee, you're all the same
And everybody who disco know your name""
I said, ""Come on baby, it's not too far
We gonna take a little walk to my car""
Once we got to the car, then we sat in the seat
And then the box was rockin to the funky beat
And then I looked at her and pushed the seat back
Turned off her box and put on my 8-track
And then I started rappin without no pause
Cause my mind was just gettin in those draws
And then I got in the straw, we started do it to the beat
And started doin like this, started doin the freak
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
Cause I'm MC Spoonie Gee, I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Cause I'm a man's threat
And I'm a woman's pet
And I'm known as the mamsel's joy
And I'm a man who fights on the microphone
And who all the people enjoy, y'all
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on
Say I was breakin and freakin at a disco place
I met a fine girl, she had a pretty face
And then she took me home, you say, ""The very same night?""
The girl was on and she was outta sight
And then I got the girl for three hours straight
But I had to go to work, so I couldn't be late
I said, ""Where's your man?"" she said, ""He's in jail""
I said, ""Come on baby, cause you're tellin a tale
Cause if he comes at me and then he wants to fight
See I'ma get the man good and I'ma get him right
See I'ma roll my barrel and keep the bullets still
And when I shoot my shot, I'm gonna shoot to kill
Cause I'm the Spoonie-Spoon, I don't mess around
I drop a man where he stand right into the ground
You say from Africa to France, say to Germany
Because you can't get a man tryin to mess with me
Cause I'm a smooth talker, I'm the midnight stalker
I'm the image of the man they call the J.D. Walker
If you're gonna be my girl, just come along
And just clap your hands to my funky song
I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't gamble neither
And most people call me a woman pleaser
Cause I keep their phone numbers on the shelf

So no one's gonna know what I'm doin to you
Not your sister, brother, niece, nor your mother, father too""

And rock on y'all, and don't stop
Keep on to the shill shot
And for you sucker-sucker dudes who commit a crime
You wanna do bad, but don't do the time
I say you wanna be dissed and then you wanna be a crook
You find a old lady, take her pocketbook
And then you steal your mother's borrowed money on the sly
You can run, but you can't hide
When the cops crashed through, your face turned pale
I'ma tell you a little story about the jail
Cause see, in jail there's a game and it's called survival
And they run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and cannot do
But if you go to jail, watch yours for a crew
Cause when you go in the shower, he's pullin his meat
And he's lookin at you and say you look real sweet
And at first there was one, now ten walked in
Now how in the hell did you expect to win?
I said you better look alive, not like you take dope
And please my brother, don't drop the soap
And if you get out the bathroom, and you're alive
Just remember only a man can survive
In jail of course, cause when you're doin 15 years
You got no ??????, you just have a warden
????? no ???? a corner
?????
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on to shill shot
Like a lime to a lemon and a lemon to a lime
I keep the funky beat, I say I pass the time
And like lemon and lime and like a lime to a lemon
A MC could attract all the women
Cause I'm Spoonie Gee, and I wanna be known
As the metropolitician of the microphone
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
So just clap your hands and just stomp your feet
And just rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
To the funky, funky, funky, funky beat
The beat that makes you get up and pat your feet
Young ladies rock on, y'all
Rock on, y'all
Till the break of dawn
I say you do the Spank or the Patty Duke
Either one you want, you gotta get up and do
The rock-rock and you don't stop
I say I jumped the turnstyle for summer day
And then I seen the guy, and then I fled away
And then he pulled his gun, but he did not shoot
So come on everybody, let's Patty Duke
Cause I'm livin well, and I'm ready to dance
Come on girl, let me show my romance
I'll let you see the way how I rock the mic
Cause I know damn well that I could rock all night
Yes, yes, y'all
Freak, freak, y'all
And don't stop
Keep on, y'all
You go rock and roll
And then you roll and rock..

But I didn't wanna out-play my hand
So I talked so that she could understand
Me, she was definitely the move
I only said sweet things that would soothe
Her, opened up the door, and she got in
And automatically my mind just turned to sin
I told her: ""Take it off!""
[ VERSE 2 ]
Now I met this girl at Amusement Park
She was good to go and it was after dark
But you can guess, fellas, what was on my mind
Let's go under the boardwalk and have a good time
Baby, instead the girl asked me my sign
And I said, ""Why?"" and she said, ""Never mind""
Cause when the time comin it's you I'm thinkin of
A sign will make a difference on how you make love
To me you make me feel so good as a man
Ooh baby, you're sweet as cotton can-
-dy, if I could predict the rest of my life
I'd be a millionaire and you'd be my wife
So let's take a ride through the tunnel of love
Because you know what I'm thinkin of
Come on, baby, just take it off
[ VERSE 3 ]
Now I met this girl on the French Riviera
She said, ""Spoonie Gee, I'm gonna go wherever
You go, when you're on tour or when you're chillin
Cause if you're able, Spoonie Gee, I'm willin""
I said, ""Pretty mama, that's okay with me
So pass a glass and we'll sip Chablis
And in a half hour you'll be emblissed
When I give you a big french kiss
And then you wanna take it off""

Well let's get this straight, there's no contest
So now you people know don't have to guess
I'm not tha king of rap, not lord, not prince
I was a young kid rapper that I've been rapping ever since
I was just a young bub, I didn't care what mc's did
Before ??? cause I'm the godfather
I caught silly young ladies, two just chilled
They never said no to me - always say that they will do
Whenever I want them to - when I confront them to
Watch where ya're walkin', or just might browl to
I never rule them, I only school them
But if they ever try to fool me
That's when I foo them
I'm tha godfather
Long time to be chillin', just to make money
I rapped on stage, check my voice for your honey
Cause I'm rappin', and I'm not stoppin'
MC baby, who love stand hip-hopin'
so don't tease me, just kiss me
If ya already had a pimp, ya gonna miss me
I'm just a brother so what's upsaid
Cause it's a pretty ladies, I mean top like this
Ya know I'm the godfather
They say that I'm an mc some say that I'm a proud
I changed my style people just didn't know it yet
I had to tell them I might kill them
you mess with me I'm sick your ass then swell them
Woah like on the phone, I'm 'bout to take charge
At the station for the new car in my garage
They want to cruise me, they don't move me
See my bankroll they want to try to use me
But I'm no fool never losin' my cool
But for me to darkness I make the young ladies drool
I'm not braggin' tellin' you what I'm about
Young ladies no babies and marriage bout
But if you insist you can't convince your house are mine
Night or day we'll be fine
So let's get with it, so that I can't hit it
After an hour or two me and you can just quit it
I'm the godfather
There's no need to be smokin' when the fire is out
So take your hand off your hip and let's work out
No leanin' on the wall no standin' around
So are you ready (for what ?!) for the beat in me now
Because people can't see me so people want to be me
Pretty young ladies want L Blue Spoon
The beat so fair so ate 9 o'clock in the morning
If they're playin' they'll call the cops cause I'm the godfather
I'm the godfather
You got rockin' beat no stoppin' beat
Some roars have things pumpin' beat
All the rest of my time Jerry knows my side
I'm so dip that's why I keep all girls in your mind
I'm not dedicate this at the top of this
Say cool you bring, don't break the rules if you wanna get this
Respect me brother rapper recorded on the show
Ya could stare, cause I don't care it's just long you know
I'm the godfather
Now you be jumpin' your heart will be thumpin
Intendin' rappin', swearin' hip hopin'
Off your face, all know the place
Easely scatty standin' in pace
Don't stand around, your face road in my clan
This is the season no prisonner can't get down
So get all the world, let's up these words
Boogie down to the beat just give it to y'all
No need to get hot money dispenser
You can't have a good time cause it's so danger
I'm the godfather...of rap

Once they announce my name and I get out on stage
I'm just like an animal let out of his cage
I can't control myself, I start dancin and rhymin
People on the streets start droppin a dime and
Tellin everybody: ""Hey, Spoonie Gee's housin
He got the people in the place jumpin and bouncin""
Up and down, hey, they just don't understand it
How do I get results, my brother I just demand it
It starts with a pen and a paper, then to a studio
With the engineer that says 'go', now you know
This is the place to be
This is the place to be
Now in this game you gotta be a perfect rapper
Be sharp, clean, dressed up, for me I just be dapper
Do what I have to, I make money, but no trouble
But if your head is swollen, I bust your bubble
Cause in this game, with fake MC's it's been polluted
The reason that I'm in it, cause in me it has been rooted
Before I was born Almighty God had a plan
He said, ""You're gonna be a rapper, my man""
So - this is the place to be
This is the place to be
I finished my mission, I'm in a higher position
So when it comes to my records, choose to dance or just listen
You'll be excited, could never be bored
I'm givin you a piece of my talent you can't afford
It, so as the clock ticks and the time goes on
I thank God every minute for the day I was born
He gave me a talent, and above all the chance
To rap on the mic, to show you my dance
He wakes me up, then lays me down to sleep
So that I can write a record that can rock to the beat
You're feelin low and need somewhere to go?
You come check me out at the show, you know?
This is the place to be
This is the place to be

My friend asked me why I'm so unhappy
The reason was because you wasn't with me
There to hold, love and to kiss me
But now since you're back from school
Let's go to my house and break a rule, baby
Cause the night is young
And you ain't dumb
So please gimme some
Of that yum yum, baby
You tell your girlfriends that you hate my guts
But if you hate me so much
Why did you kiss me last night?
You kissed me once, you kissed me twice
You put your hand on my knee when I was cool as ice
And jumped up from the sofa to fix me a drink and
The room got heated, and I knew what you was thinkin
Takes two to tango, but not me and you
Cause you're the kind, if it ain't right, you'll sue me
For all of my possessions and my privates too
So the only thing that you can do
Is gimme some yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Now you tell everybody that you're not my sweetie
But you're all in one, nice, tall and meaty
So gimme a chance and, girl, you'll see
That after one night, ooh baby, you'll love me
So if you change your mind, please let me know
Because sky is the limit anywhere we'll go
And we'll have a ball, baby, if not have fun
And in the process have a daughter or a son
Don't unestimate me, appreciate me
Cause I been feelin the need for love lately
The night is young and you ain't dumb
So gimme some of that yum yum, baby
You can come to my house, lay down and go to sleep too
It been a while, you'll see what I wanna do
I do it to the left and do it to the right
And if possible make love all night
I want yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Ice cream and cherries too
Put all of them together, and it's sweet as you
Not needing to tell me and you
You can't help yourself, so what ya gonna do?
You tell your mother and your father
Sister, uncle and your friend
A couple other people that are not your kin
About the yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that yum yum, baby
Yum yum, gimme some
Gimme some of that - ooh baby
I went around my block, people was lookin at me
A friend asked me why I'm so unhappy
But now since you're back from school
Let's go to my house and break a rule
Baby, the night is young, and you ain't dumb
So gimme some of that yum yum, baby
You tell everybody that you hate my guts
But if you hate me so much
Why did you kiss me last night?
You know what, girl?
It's been a while
Since I had some real good lovin
But I don't know why you give me such a hard time, baby
I admit you're cute
Okay - you're fine
But baby, you're not worth it, man
That's right, I say 'man'
Cause that's the way you act sometime, you know
Yum yum, yum yum
Why don't you give me some
Yum yum, baby
Yum yum
Gimme some
Gimme some of that - ooh baby

Rhymes faster than a speeding bullet
Has more rhymes than a train has tracks
Able to leap sucker MC's in a single rhyme
Look, at the jam, on the mike
(It's a bird!)
(It's a plane!)
No
I'm Su-
Su-
Super Rhymes
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)
(Rhymes)...
It's the new thing, makes you wanna swing
While us MC's rap, doin our thing
It's not singin, like it used to be
No, it's rappin to the rhythm of the sure shot beat
It goes one for the money, two for the show
You got my beat, now here I go
You see, this DJ, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, ya just don't stop
You rock to the beat till it makes you drop
Yes, I'm one of a kind, I'm Super Rhymes
And I'd like to say hello
And since I'm on the mic and I'm ready to rock
This is how it goes
Yes, I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-ding-ding-ding-ding-a-dang
Baby, I'll ring your bell
Yes, I'm Super Rhymes, I'm 22
I'm gonna be 100 before I'm through
Because no, I didn't come from the planet Earth
Planet Rhymeon is my place of birth
>From the day I came out my mother's womb
I found myself in the operating room
Then the doctor spanked me on my behind
I didn't cry, the kid started to rhyme
My mother said, ""Son, that's the way it should be
Your name is Super Rhymes, you'll be an MC""
So then my father put me on a meteorite
Sent me to Earth to rock the mike
I got to Earth and started layin it down
At the jam, on the mike, I could be found
While I was at the jam this one time
Rockin to the beat, said I'm feelin fine
Just freakin out on a freak's behind
I looked in the face of Frankenstein
I said, ""No, no, she's not mine""
Because my woman is fine as wine
And she goes by the name of Louis Line
But she didn't come here with me this time
I'm feeling real sad, but not that bad
I'ma have to run away from this crowdad
I ran to the deejay to rock the mike
He said, ""Super Rhymes, take it, do what you like""
So I rocked the party viciously
This guy I didn't know, walked up to me
But the closer he got, the more I could tell
It was the man they call Howard Cosell
The guy you'd see on KBC
While Joe Frazier boxed Muhammad Ali
He said, ""Excuse me, sir, are you Super Rhymes?
The one with the fine woman Louis Line?""
I said, ""I am, will I be on TV?
Like to float like a butterlfy stingin Ali
He said, ""Yes, my man, if you show me you can
I was told you had the masterplan""
So I rocked the mike for Howard Cosell
To show America how I rocked so well
And while I rocked the mike, this is what I said
About Dracula, the living dead
He didn't like blood, not this vampire
The disco beat was his desire
Transylvania's where he made home
Until one day he decided to roam
And then out of the crib he did crawl
Count Dracula is what he's called
He said, ""The sun's gone down, and now it's night
I'm goin to spread my wings and take a serious flight
I turned into a bat, I flew away
I said at the disco is where I gotta stay
Because back home, there was nothing like this
In Transylvania this is what I'd miss
They just bite necks and suck blood all day
But I know there had to be a better way
I parked my car, sun set, ""Vampires, I am leaving""
So I turned into a bat and cut out that evening
The first disco I hit was 54
They didn't even want to let me in the door
I said, ""Listen, my man, I am a real cool guy
I can turn into a bat, I can even fly""
He said, ""Dracula, you can do all of that
Then come on in and catch a neat freak attack""
So I went inside and I started to dance
And had all the ladies waitin for their chance
They said, ""Isn't he cool with his widow's peak""
And the strange way he does the Freak
He said, ""Where I come from it's not called the 'Freak'
It's the Transylvanian Boogie, seven days a week""
I didn't get to dance with them all that night
Cause at the break of dawn I saw sunlight
I said, ""I'm sorry to say I cannot stay""
Cause us vampires must be in before it turns day
But don't forget, I'll be back
I like it when I catch a neat freak attack
And since you heard my story, it's time I be leaving
In Transylvania we say ""good evening""
Mr. Cosell said, ""Damn, that's good
You'll be on TV in every neighborhood""
He said, ""Super Rhymes, you're a real MC
We must put you on KBC""
I said, ""I'll dress to impress, won't claim I'm best
I'll come a little better than all the rest""
Because I never come with any less
Than all the rhymes that will pass the test
Because I'm cool as ice, I'm twice as nice
I never had an off-day in my life
You see, I take all your money, bust out your wife
Make you dance to my beat all your life
Cause when I get in my stuff and I start to rhyme
The sucker MC's hide everytime
Because my voice is baritone
And I really don't need no microphone
But I use one anyway
To make sure the ladies hear what I say
And from here to there they hear my voice
The ladies hear me, I am their choice
Because my hair's more wavy than there's ships in the Navy
And they use a boat to stay afloat
To put hickeys all over my throat
Because I am SO COOOOOOOL...
Because I'm cool as snow, I'm like savoir-faire
I'm the man you can't find anywhere
Because I'm cooler than cold, I'm hotter than heat
I rock to the rhythm of the funky beat
Because I got what it takes
To make everybody wanna break
You see I gotta what it take
I take it, make you wanna break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I say this is what I wanna say to all of you
Go and telephone, or tell a friend
The man known as Super Rhymes is back again
And all you fly guys, I tell you this
I take your fly girls with one kiss
Because I take the fly girls, put em in check
I got my love potion all around they neck
They've heard my voice and they know my name
They know within me there burns a flame
That I'm MC man, headed straight for fame
I got a Coupe DeVille, diamond rings
I even got fur coats and gold plate things
Cause I'm the man of the hour, too sweet to be sour
The ladies know I'm the man with the power
And now that you know a little more about me
This is how I rocked KBC
You see, deep in the desert, the city Bagdhad
Aladdin was the boy, a magic lamp he had
Aladdin was to rub it and soon find out
That the lamp had magic and a genie, no doubt
He rubbed the lamp, a genie appeared
But you really couldn't see him till the green smoke cleared
Well, the smoke was gone, and there he stood
The tallest damn cat in the neighborhood
He said, ""Where I come from I committed a crime
For every little thing you must serve time
But if my lamp was rubbed I'd be set free
But otherwise within the lamp I stay eternally
And Aladdin, I say thanks to you
You rubbed my lamp, now my sentence is through
And Aladdin, your wish is my command
I'm sorry, but you only get three, my man""
He said, ""Genie, my first wish would be
To go to the year 1980""
""Hocus pocus,"" said the genie, ""I'll do that""
Aladdin looked around, saw where he was at
He said, ""Damn, things aren't the same
I wonder if Aladdin is still my name
But it's nice to be in '80
And I gotta say thanks to you, genie""
He said, ""There's nothin to it, I used to do it just about everyday
Until I went to court, I got put in the lamp and the judge to take the spell away
But then you came along, made right my wrong
You rubbed my lamp and you set me free""
He said, ""You used one wish, and you got two left
Aladdin, tell me what's it gonna be?""
He said, ""Genie, in this society
You must have the green stuff called money""
So ""hocus pocus"" said the genie, ""here's a million bucks
You take it all with you, here's an armored truck""
""Thanks,"" said Aladdin, ""Genie, you're a real champ
But for a little while get back in your lamp""
The genie said, ""Aladdin, yes, I'll do that
But you got another wish, now I'll be back""
So with a puff and smoke the genie was gone
Aladdin said, ""A new millionaire is born""
Well, with all that money he made more money, Aladdin was doin swell
You see, my man Aladdin he got smart, you see, invested money into an oil well
But then one day he said, ""I'm tired of makin the desert scene""
He said, ""I gotta get away, I gotta go to the disco, find the freak of my dream""
So he took control of his private jet
His magic lamp and money he could not forget
Yes, he got to the disco, danced and screamed
But still couldn't find the freak of his dream
But then she came, through the door
The baddest freak Aladdin said he ever saw
He said, ""Wow! I gotta get that girl!
Her love is worth everything in the world""
She was a 38-24-35
Aladdin was attracted like a bee to a hive
Aladdin walked up, said, ""Hello""
She looked him up and down and said, ""You know where you can go""
He said, ""Come on, baby, don't play no game
I'm called Aladdin, tell me what's your name?""
Well, out of all the things Aladdin tried
She said, ""Listen, sucker, take a carpet ride""
Aladdin said, ""I know what to do
I call on my genie with a spell for you
So then he rubbed the lamp, the genie came back out
The genie said, ""Aladdin, what you're fussin about""
He said, ""Genie, I rocked, I said I'd be her man
I tried to do it to her cause I thought I can
It was then that I met this girl
Who said she wouldn't freak me for nothin in the world""
Out of all the things that Aladdin thought
She stole him a body, just couldn't be bought
So Aladdin said 450
I know you're comin to this bank with me
But the freak told him no
And my main man Aladdin, he told her so
He said, ""I grab my partner do-si-do
I spank her to the beat, but don't let go
Until I hear her holler 'yo, yo'""
To the beat, beat, check it out
The genie said, ""Aladdin, I agree
This freak has got a vicious body
But that wish will be your last one
After I do, my job is done""
The genie said, ""Your wish is my command
She'll be your girl, you'll be her man
So he crossed his arms, said a magic word
A 'hocus pocus' is what you heard
He said, ""Aladdin, she belongs to you
Take her home and do what you wanna do
But now it's time that I leave
I pull my magic carpet down out my sleeve
I'm gonna climb aboard, I'm gonna fly away
Back to Bagdhad, that's where I'll stay""
So Aladdin looked up, said goodbye
He watched the magic carpet and the genie fly
Now this is the end of this little tale
It's time I keep rockin, the genie's out of jail
So when I say 'rock', you say 'roll'
When I say 'ice', then you say 'cold'
Then when I say 'disco', you say 'the beat'
I say 'it's like honey', then you say 'it's sweet'
I say rock - roll
Say ice - cold
Say disco - the beat
Like honey - it's sweet
Now you know my name, you know my game
Compared to me there's none the same
Because I got a funky groove, I'm gonna make your body move
Because I gotta what it take
I take it, make you wanna break
Breaker 1 (breaker 1) breaker 2 (breaker 2)
I said you heard my jam, now catch the boogaloo flu
Cause I'm Super Ryhmes with disco
I rock from here to Frisco
I make you hate your video
While I rock your mind in stereo
So kick off your shoes, relax your feet
You're gonna move to my beat, it sound so sweet
Because it's all of you I do adore
And I got so much and more in store
Cause all through the day, through the night
I sit down and new rhymes I write
Because this deejay, he gets down
Mixing records while they go round
With the hiddip, the hop, you just don't stop
You bop to the beat till it makes your drop
Because I rock so good, I rock so well
I ring-a-ding-dang-a-ding-ding-dong
Baby, I ring your bell
Because I ROCK and ROLL
In STERE-ERE-O
I ROCK and ROLL
In STERE-ERE-O
Like Fred Flintstone, said, a-yabadabado
You hear my jam, wanna yell it too
Because I got more rhymes than a clock chimes
I got more rhymes than a monkey climbs
I got more rhymes than a lemon in limes
And I got more rhymes than a bank got dimes
So freak it to the east, freak it to the west
I freak it to the girl with the biggest chest
Freak it to the west, then you freak it to the east
But you never freak out with an ugly beast
So young ladies in the '80s
Come and ride in my Mercedes
Cause the ladies see they all must stare
Because I got brown eyes and a wavy hair
I'm not so tall, but I'm not so short
And you young ladies are my favorite sport
So put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
You put your hand in the air and let me know you're out there
Then scream: oh yeah (oh yeah) oh what? (oh yeah!)
Y'all, I'm leavin now, but I'll be back
To make the young ladies catch a neat freak attack
Yes, the time has come for me to leave the mike
But I'll be back with more of what you like
So - take a trip

Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""
Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights
It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag
Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Just don't come in my face and ask me why
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba makin 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

I said peace to a brother and then I shot him
I pulled away, I know that I got him
Then I rolled up the cheeba-cheeba
That's all a brother like me really needed
Why I did it, or really why I done it?
I don't know why, but the game, I run it
Thinkin way back how the story was told
Gettin (funkeeee) when I was 12 years old
I didn't give a damn about tyin no thether
All I needed was the nine millimeter
All my homies has been some thugs
To make a little money we sold a little drugs
PSK, just makin that big green
A rough brother at the age of 16
But nowadays I'm a dope rap singer
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger
(Funkyeeee... yeah)
Your worst nightmare is a young gangbanger	(4X)
A shoe-shine nigga I never will be
When you gonna ever let a brother be free?
What up with that (funkeeee) that I see
When I turn on my TV?
Cause if you think a young brother really care
About a brother livin in Bel Air
Hell no, I'm straight from the ghetto
Smoke a little weed just to stay a little mellow
A Asiatic blackman, you understand
Because I'm rich you think that I'm a dopeman
I hear your laughter everytime that I say that
But you won't laugh when I pull on the git-gat
You rather see me pickin yo cotton
Than a young blackman clickin and clockin
G's, cause I'm a dope rap singer
Your worst nightmare a young gangbanger

Listen up, hard teachin go down from the wild side
School didn't do it, so what, gotta try
Crime - in this game yourself that's all you got
If you're soft, hard, the most times end up smooth shot
So now you're deep, you're down
Clear the line one time to trip and slip
And when you slip you're slidin right to a grave
You shoulda learned at school cause the drugs made you a slave

Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
[Man, let them know what time it is.]
Microphone living is a thing of the past
and all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass.
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn,
you fucked it all up when you let Michael in.
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock.
Because rock and roll is all illusion,
comes to no basic conclusion.
Rap like jazz is not all fusion,
DJ, 1200's you know he's using.
I don't.
I don't.
Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours,
five two point size in my court of force.
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight,
sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright.
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike,
till I get on the mic, make everything right.
Girl in my face, boy giving me static,
sat by my side, 38 automatic.
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat,
hang downtown on a market street.
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard,
so all you long haired freaks better be on guard.
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out,
because that is what rap's all about.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver,
took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever.
Got real high as you will know,
thinking to myself while I rocked her so.
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap,
so I told her: ""Fly freak, sit upon my lap"".
But I went too fast, gave me a slap,
but I looked into her face, gave her this rap.
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
you can call me MC, you can call me on the phone.
Came into the party, checked out my face,
but you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face.
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on,
right microphones, all night long.
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge,
no other MC's got this kind of song.
I don't.
I don't.
Def been mighty, rap all nighty,
chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy.
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi,
we mean you ladi will have to party.
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller.
I get bad, watch her and bone her.
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her.
You left your girl, but you know I stole her.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""

To prove to the world that he is a man
That's one thing I can never understand
Cause you'se a fluke and a coward and a faggot
You know suckers like you are on the wagon

Make it known that I'll never, never, never be stopped
There ain't a brother in the place any tougher
There ain't a sucker in the house any rougher

And if you can't understand the reality
Of a young blackman mentality

Well, I'd say you ain't nothin but a prankster
And if you think that you gonna keep foolin em
I'm the brother that you know that is schoolin em

Her mama mad cause she gave up
Took her to church every week, it couldn't save her
I got a daughter and a son
Before he say 'daddy', little nigga might say 'gun'
I sit back, I blow a kiss to my mother
Even though she old, the nigga still love her

Nah, all I knew was some nigga in a Caddy
Stopped by every year by Christmas
Talkin that bullshit he missed us
I don't look like my granny or my mammy
I look like a muthafucka named Sammy
My mother musta been a young slut
Always talkin about the days when she had a big fat butt
You gotta do what you gotta do what you gotta do

Smokin cheeba, take another hit
Step into the bathroom and take a little shit

I fucks your aunt, your sister and your mother
Now to the nigga in the Caddy who said he was my daddy

Proud to be on this microphone hittin this rap
Proud to be chillin hard with my boys on the ave
Proud to do what I do and to have what I have
Proud to be Schoolly-School and you all know my name
Proud to make lots of money but I'm not insane
Cause people don't dig it when you start actin fame
Not a toy, not a boy, and ain't playin no games
So here we go, here we go again

Whassup man, you sayin' Prince? Say Prince?
It's Schoolly D., man, we rap!
Code Money man, so whassup man?
[Man, let them know what time it is.]
Microphone living is a thing of the past
and all you long haired faggots can kiss my ass.
Started out rhymin' with DJ Lynn,
you fucked it all up when you let Michael in.
I'd rather be a day in land of the dog
then with some long haired tutti frutti running a mock.
Because rock and roll is all illusion,
comes to no basic conclusion.
Rap like jazz is not all fusion,
DJ, 1200's you know he's using.
I don't.
I don't.
Looking at my Gucci if you looking at yours,
five two point size in my court of force.
Hang out all night, keep girls real tight,
sippin' coqui 900, make me feel allright.
Met my main man Ski, looking for a bike,
till I get on the mic, make everything right.
Girl in my face, boy giving me static,
sat by my side, 38 automatic.
B-boy stands, she lies on a beat,
hang downtown on a market street.
So when the B-boys comin', we're comin' hard,
so all you long haired freaks better be on guard.
All you rock and roll lovers, we're knocking you out,
because that is what rap's all about.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Chillin' one day, I met a girl named Beaver,
took her on the Ave, conquered some cheever.
Got real high as you will know,
thinking to myself while I rocked her so.
Didn't like microphone, said she loved rap,
so I told her: ""Fly freak, sit upon my lap"".
But I went too fast, gave me a slap,
but I looked into her face, gave her this rap.
When I rock a party, there is still a microphone
you can call me MC, you can call me on the phone.
Came into the party, checked out my face,
but you rock and roll lovers, get a girl in your face.
Cause I came into the party with my sneakers on,
right microphones, all night long.
Dance to the beat, because you know who's in charge,
no other MC's got this kind of song.
I don't.
I don't.
Def been mighty, rap all nighty,
chill out hard with my homeboy Tidy.
The beat ain't righty, for you and ladi,
we mean you ladi will have to party.
Not a rock and roller, but a mic controller.
I get bad, watch her and bone her.
The bitch ain't stroller, chill right, roll her.
You left your girl, but you know I stole her.
I don't.
I don't.
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""
Say it loud: ""I love rap and I'm proud!""

Fuck it, I keep you dancin like James Brown
Alright boy, if you want it, here's the breakdown
I don't care how rough you think you is
I beat you down in the muthafuckin midst

I kick your ass like if I was your mother
I'm gonna make their minds so muthafuckin simple

Or like a crazy muthafucka on cocaine
I'm the nigga that's fuckin up yo brain

Pull a 8 on a nigga, say 'fuck you'
Then pull away in my BMW
Cause on the street you gotta be a little meaner

Grab the Uzi, the eight and the nine
When a nigga be rollin on the ave
Sometime it gonna be a blood bath
But when I'm comin, no playin, no jokin
I let the Uzi and nine be smokin
Alright now, back to my tale, yo
Spot the nigga on the corner sellin lleyo
Pull up, ""Yo, what up, gee?""
He didn't see my nigga in the backseat
All I heard was ""Please don't shoot!""
( *shots* ) grabbed the caine and the loot

Now a nigga on the top of the world, see
I got the women, the dope and the jewelry
I'm livin large in a fat-ass crib
Don't give a damn about the shit I just did
Then I heard a knock-knock at my door
Said ""Oh shit!"" - I hit the floor
One of my homies on the ave was a big snitch
I said ""Oh shit!"" - jumped through the window

Fuck it, some nigga was dyin
You either gas on or you get gased
Now I die with a bullet in my ass

[ VERSE 2: Scholly D ]
Alright sucker, you want the real deal?
Here it is, at the tip of the cold steel
Shoot a punk and a shoe-shine nigger
Shoot em all what Schoolly D figure
Line em up, put your finger on the trigger
Sit back and take a little swigger
And let a rhyme intoxicate your mind
Like a cheeba and a forty of wine
I'm gettin tired of every other brother in the ghetto
Gotta sell a little lleyo
Because a brother didn't have enough knowledge
Didn't know because he didn't go to college
I'm gettin tired of the suckers on my back
Because I'm black, hard with a dope rap
Do you think a young brother wanna hear that?
They rather hear a brother pullin on a git-gat
Run, run, run, run, run, you better run fast
Another sucker just got gased
[ VERSE 3: guest rapper ]
Jump fast out the startin block
>From this gat from the fact that I hold you will feel the pop
Gunshots on the neighborhood
Are the sounds of brothers hard up to no good
Feel the pain of a bullet wound
For suckers tryin to slip and trip, time to meet their doom
Like the sounds of a battle cry
Either run, soft sucker, or get caught, do or die
Flee, it's the reality
Cause I see another weak comp, it's so violent, see
Brothers dyin over property
Dope, money, women and ki's
So now the time is at hand
You can sit down, be a punk or be a man
It's like chillin, cold lampin on death row
And I catch you, boy, in a grave you go
Stay out on the move, it ain't for fun
Yo School, make them suckers wanna run, run, run
(Run) [cut up until end]

Went to a bar and caught me a 40
Got kinda a high and a...kinda drunk
So I kicked the ass of this little punk
Forgot my key and had to ring my bell
My momma came dressed, she said, ""Who the hell?""
Wait momma, wait, it's me ya little son
Before I knew it my mom pulled a gun
""I know who you are, but who the hell is that?""
I turned around man, this bitch was fat
I really don't know, she got into the car
I musta picked her up when I left the bar
Ya know I'm horny homey man I wanted to chill
But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill
So I said, ""Hey baby is you on the pill?
'Cause, tonight I wanna be your lover
Just one thing:  I forgot to buy a rubber""
Wait a little while then we snuk upstairs
Step by step with a hint of fear
We got into my room, bitch started to scream
Momma busted in with a fucked up scene
Shirt ripped off, drawers down to my knees
Wait momma, wait momma, wait, wait, please!
Put back your gun, put down your brew
My mom fucked up the room
The bitch jumped up with no respect
I had to put the big, big bitch in check
I said, ""Ya come a little closer and ya will get shot,
I'm sober anyway, I don't need no cock.""
Oh yeah, them wild Saturday Nights
It was Saturday Night and I was feelin kinda funny
Gold around my neck, pockets full of money
Went to the corner, man who did I see?
But the super bad bitch lookin back at me
I said, ""Fly lady man, you got a big butt""
Bitch turned around, all she said was, ""What?""
I said, ""My name is Schoolly baby, I'm down with the Shores""
Before I knew it up came my boys
Noisy as hell and drunk as shit
Sayin, ""Yo Schoolly Schooll, what time is it?""
Looked a little closer and I knew it was gag
What I thought was a girl was nothin but a fag
Everybody rappin but they don't know how
Shoulda seen the boy rappin to the cow
He rapped so hard that the nigga saw smoke
He lit up his cheeba and they both took a toke
The cow got high and the boy got by
Just don't come in my face and ask me why
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah it's that cheeba cheeba makin 'em feel like that
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
Smokin a J and scratchin' the itch
Along came a spider and sat down beside her
And said, ""Yo, what's up with that, bitch?""
But then down the road came Mary and her lambs
Smokin' a Lacy in each and every hand
The poor little spider, he couldn't score any
They were 2 dollar bitches and he only had a penny
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Let me tell ya a little tale about Peter the Pimp
Sucka MCed, tried to cop a limp
Rode around town in a couple of cars
Got gagged by the man tryin to stick up a bar
The judge said, ""Boy, what was on your mind?""
He said, ""I had some Cheeba Cheeba, cocaine and some wine.""
The judge said, ""Boy, relax and have a beer
You won't be doin shit for the next ten years.""
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll
Yeah, it's that Cheeba Cheeba
Cheeba Cheeba
Some call it Cheeba, some call it weed
It's the killer, it's the filler, it's the thing that you need
Cheeba Cheeba ya'll

Yeah, what's up, what's goin on?
Before we start this next record
I gotta put my shades on

Well it's still a law, you gotta put your shades on so you can feel cool

I'ma put my shades on so I can see what you ain't doin'

Now let's get on with this shit anyway
[Schoolly D]
Way, way down, in the ghetto Tee
The badass pimp stepped on the signifying rapper's feet
And the rapper said, Nigga can't you see
You're standin on my motherfucking feet?
The badass pimp said, Sure I ain't heard a cocksucking word you said
You say some more, I'll be standin on your motherfucking head
Yeah that's what he said
Cause every day, when the sun go down
The badass pimp come and kick that rappers ass all over ghetto town
But the rapper got wise, started using his wit
And said man, I'm gettin tired of this kick-ass shit
So early, early early the very next day
The rapper said, mister pimp, mister pimp I got something to say
There's this mean, big bad faggot comin your way
He talk about you so bad, turn my hair gray
Listen, listen to what he say
Listen to this mister badass pimp
This what the faggot said
He said, you know your daddy and he's a faggot
And your mother's a whore
He said he seen you sellin asshole door to door
Yeah that's what he said, listen to what else he said mister badass pimp
He said, your granny, she's a dyke
And your other brother, he's a faggot
And your little sister Loo
She's so low she sucked the dick of a little maggot
Yeah that's what he said
The badass pimp was mad
Jumped up in a hell of a rage
Hopped in his Caddy and loaded his 12 guage
Caught up with the faggot on 55th and Vine
Said you faggot, it's gonna be your ass or mine
The faggot looked at the pimp, and saw fear in his eyes
Said motherfucker, you better go fuck with somebody your own damn size
The pimp made his move, and thought he was fast
The faggot side-stepped him and kicked him in his ass
They fought all that night, and all the next day
That faggot kicked that pimp's ass in a hell of a way
Me myself I don't know how he survived
Came back to the projects more dead than alive
And the rapper, standin up on one of those tall ass project buildings
He said, DAMN somethin smells
He said, mister badass pimp look live you've been through hell
As I told one of my hoes before you left
I should've kicked your ass my motherfucking self

Cause here comes the Big Mama
Any bitch who rip Shanny, I bomb her
Cause y'all weak-ass hoes got me fed up
So hookers, get your gloves, and yo, let's got head up
Wall to wall y'all all will fall
I don't stall cause in this brawl it's winner takes all
A title bout for all the clout
Any hooker tryin to step to this, it's lights out
One hit, your head split, throat slit
Think you're Miss It, but I started this shit
At 14 years old I was goin gold
While I was on tour, you was tourin the hoe stroll
Suckin dicks and turnin tricks to get a quick fix
While I was puttin dope hits in the mix
Rippin shows with Kane and Biz Markie
Fuckin up Roxanne and takin out Sparky
Niggas came in flocks from blocks and blocks
To watch the Rox knock bitches out the box
And every place I played, I headlined
Striclty big names on the topic read mine
The q-u-double e-n
Queen of emceein
Whenever I flow it's poetry in
Motion, so you can save all the drama
And get the fuck out the way, here comes the Big Mama
(Mama - mama - Aww!)

Rhymes are deadly, so hooker, write out your will
Here comes the queen foot-first to your grill
Recitin poems that hit like boulders
Smackin your head dead off your muthafuckin shoulders
So nip all the talk in a bud
This ain't no gameboy, I came to draw blood
At any hag thinkin that she can last with me
It only takes one blast, and that ass'll be
Wrecked, ruined, damaged, ripped
Cross my path, your ass'll get whipped
Cause Shanté ain't about no games
Matter of fact, yo, I'ma start callin off names
First up there's Latifah
You roll up, and I'ma smoke that ass like reefer
Cause you ain't never in life been a star to me
Sold the fuck out tryin to go R&B
Now that shit is shady
You say ladies first, well I'm the first lady
And all y'all hoes are phoney
Try to get flippid, I'ma rip you and your girl Monie
You're illegitimate, tryin to get a little bit
And I'm about sick of that 'Monie-in-the-middle'-shit
Your album cold garbage
Had one good jam, now you think you a star, bitch
Breakin your neck tryin to be in the limelight
But give you a mic, and you can't even rhyme right
So get the fuck off the scene
Cause I got a M-16 that says 'Shanny's the queen'
And all you bitches got your style from me
The capital S-h-a-n-t-é
Used to go to my show, analyze how the sound flow
On the down low, fuck around, lay around, hoe
So save all the drama
And make room for the Big Mama

The real queen's in effect
Whenever I come, yo, I come correct
And niggas give me the utmost due respect
And any hag that try to last
'll cold get smoked like marihuana cause her ass is grass
I dig ditches for you bitches
While I collect riches and give you a head full of stitches
Cause in a beef I don't sleep or lollygag
Sendin you hags off-stage in a bodybag
Cause Shanté is a rebel
You say you're lyte as a rock, you get crushed like a pebble
One word, and I'ma bag her
Watch the bitch stagger, cause I don't dig the bulldagger
To me a wush don't deserve a mic in hand
Somebody tell her to stop actin like a man
She needs somethin real thick to help her out quick
(What?) And that's a good piece of dick
Now as for that West Coast slut
With fake-ass hair, contacts, and a patted butt
Instead of stompin to the 90s, use your brain
And stomp your ass down to Jack Lelane
You better hurry and hop on a diet plan
And keep the pork chops out the fryin pan
Yeah, I said it, so what?
You roll up, slut, you get a fuckin gumbut to your gut
I'm bringin tears to all my peers
I ain't new, I been doin this shit for 10 years
Bring any hoe, and I wreck her
I rip the nicest, from Isis down to Salt-N-Pepa
And now you know that I'm the star of the show, hoe
While I get dough, you're givin up the yo-yo
You say a nigga can't play with it
You got another job? Well bitch, you better stay with it
Cause you ain't shit in this here
Shanté's the queen, and I'm makin it clear
Kickin flavors the way it's supposed to be
That's why no other MC's comin close to me
I leave em all in the dust
From crumbs to crust
It's a must that all opponents get bust
So get the fuck off the stage and save all the drama

They're lookin for the next big ass they can stick
But this here chick's not on your dick
Pullin your cars up close by the sidewalk
And got the nerve to get mad if I don't talk
Steady schemin on how they wanna stick it from the back
A young muthafucka sellin crack
Go home and go to bed, son
You're just comin from the barbershop and tryin to get your head done
Take your ass downtown on 10th Avenue
Because a sister like me is not havin you
Player, go around tellin other brothers that you laid her
So I guess I'll see your ass later
Some brothers approach you while you're shoppin
Their girl's not around, so they're goin hoe-hoppin
>From one girl to another
You turn your head for a minute, he's tryin to kick it to your mother
Stop smilin, I know all you wanna do is hit
And I really don't give a shit
They get mad, cause I always look serious
So they slam on my muthafuckin period
I'm not impressed by the jewelry and the mink, dummy
Why don't you put some of your money in the bank, sonny?
And if I hurt your feelings, I meant to
Cause these here pants you can't get into

A kid named Mark with dark glasses
Talkin about (Yo, y'all got some real fat asses)
I kept walkin, Tracy stopped and started talkin
With all these muthafuckas hawkin
With that dumb-lookin grin
Bitch gets in the car that was carryin three men
I know the whole game well
They spend a little money, you end up at a hotel
Well, that's how they planned it
She didn't wanna screw, so they left her ass stranded
That's what she gets for wildin
Cold left the dumb bitch somewhere out in Long Island
Next time she'll act decent
And her moms won't have to come and get her ass from a precint
Remember Shanté told you
Drugs is not the only thing a girl can say no to
You gotta watch every move that you make on the street
Word up, cause talk ain't that cheap
It may become a bad habit
You see a brother with a little bit of dough, you wanna grab it
I get approached by a man, sometimes I throw a fit
Word, cause brothers ain't shit

Brothers ain't shit
So don't honk your horn, keep rollin
No, I don't wanna ride, cause the shit might be stolen
Anyway, I know your number
You got a 'gas, grass or ass'-sticker on your bumper
Go ahead and say I'm stuck up
Cause I ain't doin nothin that will make my rep fucked up
Cause it happens to the best of us
Fuck the rest of us
Niggas keep testin us
A man could make you wanna kill him
Or late at night make you wanna thrill him
He'll give you money, you can even be fly
But he still has to cheat, and you wanna know why?
That's the dog in him - woof, woof!
That makes him get up in the middle of the night and go 'poof!'
You say, ""Yo, yo, where you goin'""
He's cheatin and he's skeezin and you're not even knowin
But this is what they usually do
Suck on the thing, and they make you go ""Whoo...""
And then he hits the door
And for the rest of the night you don't see him no more
He's got shit at your house? Here's what you do
You should do some voodoo
Make his dick small
Make him see spiders on the wall
Then make him throw a fit
Why? Cause brothers ain't shit

Deadly rhymes the pages of rage strikes again
Killing men women and children
til defeat, types of shelter to helter skelter
Nobody's around here to help ya
[Shante]
Up in flames the brainstorm rain drains your veins
The only remains is rains of brains
Fixed to mix, Shante's lyrics cause conflicts
I'm quick in my rhymes like convicts
[Kool G Rap]
Got a plan for a deathwish? Come on, step up
Some tried to keep up, but never kept up
When I roll nobody can't hold me
So they all told me to make em die slowly
[Shante]
The warning signs of danger read please take precautions
I'm giving your baby rhymes abortions
Hit the deck when I wreck one got shot in the neck
Poison escaped through the tape decks
Confusion, havin a need for a blood transfusion
She couldn't stop my intrusion
[Kool G Rap]
Your inner path will belong to a tidal wave
Sound waves'll take you straight to your graves
Pain remains in your head suffocation
Strangulation, raped by the whole nation
[Shante]
On stage tryin to recite like me
But what I really see is Creep Show 3
I size em up to die and pulverize em
So bad her own mother won't recognize em
[Kool G Rap]
This goes for those, that oppose like foes
But I don't diss (I dispose)
Somewhere right near nightmare right where your mind hear
Songs are long like light years
[Shante]
So here's a taste of the lyrical greats of all time
WHAT? Deadly rhymes
[Chorus]
[Shante]
Attack, ready to track the wack rappers who slack
I attract, cause you lack, you sad sack
The microphone fanatic, comin in with the impact
In fact, this track, to subtract, I pack
a pile of stacks back in the sack for snacks
but I react, right and exact, cause I'm black
Got a taste, and treble and bass you can't chase
In case you wanna race the pace I got haste
to ace to your case in your face just like mace
I replace, wreck the place and then erase show
[Kool G Rap]
I captivated, those that violated
Alienated, styles anhilated
Rappers, evacuated, faded, vacated
Waited, for my spot to be isolated
Crash and smash and bash you in the trash
in a flash I whiplash you burned to an ash
A mass defeat, delete, rhymes are like concrete
Rappers and police all retreat to my beat
except they don't step but yep they gettin carried in a stretcher
Done by the treacherous rap wrecker
[Shante]
Start tearin and scarin, don't you hear in
We'll put fear in, song comparin
You get tossed across like Kris Kross
To force you fell course boss (and now you're lost)
All rhymes are organized like crime
That's why the title of this here design is - DEADLY RHYMES

[Intro]
[Shante]
We came here tonight to get started
To cold act ill or get retarded...
[Verse]
[Shante]
I'm Shante and the rhymes are def
Just rap so fresh 'til I get out of breath
Now this is somethin' that we do have to do
And this is a team that I must introduce
I'm Shante, he's Biz Markie
We rap so fresh that they think it's three
Three of us who rap together
Strong as a bond that is tougher than leather
My name is Shante and yes, I'm top choice
And you can tell by the sound of my voice
That the way that I rock that I am the best
Higher than the rest, plus considered fresh
Threw on my Filas and my Fila suit
Stepped out my house, I just knew I was cute
Bumped into Biz, he had on Filas too
I said, ""Yo, Biz Markie. What ya wanna do?""
He stepped out the house chillin', yes ya know
Went outside, it's kinda cold ya know
So I threw on the bomber so I could get loose
Matter of fact it was my black Goose
Stepped outside, everyone was on it
I said, ""You like it, baby. Don't you want it?""
They looked at me, they thought it was funny
And out of my pocket came a mint of money
Me and Biz went Uptown, yes
Chillin' around cos we know we're the best
And then this guy came up to me
He said, ""We want you to make a record, you see""
Looked at Biz, said, ""Do ya wanna do it?""
He said, ""Yeah, Shante. There's nothin' to it""
I said, ""Alright"", and time has passed
""I saved the money""
""Ha ha!"" and we laugh...
[Biz laughter]
""That's not enough...
Things are gettin' tough and sort of rough
If you're not paying me ten G's or more
Then you might as well take your contract out the door""
He looked at me, he got so mad
And then when he left we were sort of glad
No, we don't sniff coke, we don't get high
All we do is dress real fly
Hang out at a party 'til the mornin' light
Chillin' all the time while other MC's bite
I say my rhymes, he does the beat
And you know me and him could never be defeated
We never sing Beat It and no, we don't Eat It
And if you do not like it, well yes you can bite it
And don't you go and get excited
I'm Shante, he's Biz Markie
Side by side you know it's we
No, I don't speak French, when I say we
I mean us two, not 'Yes, sirree'
Everyone knows that I am much better
Come on Biz Markie, get it together
Talk to the girls, you know they are wack
Tell those crabs they sound like cats...
[Biz mews like a cat while beatboxing!]
That subject's cute and it's sort of fine
But another subject just came in my mind
It's sort of crazy, it's sort of wack
I'm talkin' about five-dollar cracks
Runnin' round town just stickin' up each other
Ready to rob each other's mother
Gettin' little capsules, don't wanna choke
And all you do is sit down and smoke
Your jaws move in, your body gets skinny
You spend your money to your very last penny
You walk around town in the same old jeans
And yes you know just what I mean
No, you're not cute and you're sort of wack
You're gettin' really skinny, only big as your hat
And if you wanna beef I'll tell you so
And here's a few things that you should know
Yes, it's crack, then it's Peace
Come on y'all, take it from me
I was told to stay away
This is a message from Shante
You wanna dress fly and have some cash?
Well stay away from it because it's like a rash
Once you get it you start to itch
It's attached just like a (Hhhuh!)
Let's continue with what I said
Cos this is somethin' playin' in your head
Cos we come to party just to have action
Just to prove to you that I'm not Michael Jackson
Rap so strong and rap so def
Rap 'til I get out of breath
Now we have introduced to you
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew...
[Outro]
[Shante]
Me and Biz, the Def Fresh Crew
That was def. See you later...

Some people call me Shanie, some people call me Rox
And those who try to diss I just knocks them out the box
Cos I'm Shanti and y'all know the routine
And here we go again, so all hail the queen
I left you for a while but it was worth the wait
Because it gave me just enough time to create
A funky rhythm that's guaranteed to move the world
Have the party people screamin' out ""Go on Girl!""
Just like Diana Ross I'm the boss
And those who disapprove you can go for yours
But to think a girl like me, ha, is easy to take
You should treat me like Nell Carter, Give Me a Break
Cos I'm the super female that's called Shanti
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day...
[Verse 2]
A lotta MC's today really know how to please
But I gave birth to most of them MC's
So when it comes around to the month of May
Send me your royalty check for Mother's Day
Because yo, ya know, ya can't deal with this
I'm Shanti the microphone grandmistress
A pioneer like Lola Folana
With a name that stands big like Madonna
Speakin' of Madonna some girls on the mic
Rap like virgins and get real tight
But I get loose with the rhymes I produce
That's why I'm queen of the crew with the juice
Cos I'm the super female that's called Shanti
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day...
[Verse 3]
Shanti, the baddest around
And a name like that can be broken down
As Supreme Highness Almighty Noble Topics Exponent
And any title for a girl, you can believe I own it
Cos to me there ain't nuttin' fresher
For me to rock...my pleasure
I'll pick up the microphone and start rockin'
Say the funky rhymes that have the people clockin'...
Me, the S-H-A-N-T-E
Good lookin', never took'n female MC
I'm five foot four, maybe a little bigger
Brown skin complexion with a nice figure
Yes, the super female that's called Shanti
And like Hurricane Annie I'll blow you away
Whenever I'm in a battle, yo, I don't play
So you best go about your way and have a nice day...
[Verse 4]
You may remember the voice from a few years ago
When I first came out and dissed UTFO
I chilled for a while, I put down my pen
But now some suckas from the Bronx got me started again
Now I'm not out to diss the whole Boogie Down
Just a featherweight crew from that part of town
You made a little record and then you start frontin'
Tried to diss the Juice Crew but ain't hurt nuttin'
Now KRS-ONE you should go on vacation
With that name soundin' like a wack radio station
And as for Scott La Rock, you should be ashamed
When T La Rock said ""It's Yours"", he didn't mean his name
So step back peasants, poppin' all that junk
Or else BDP will stand for Broken Down Punks
Cos I'm an All-Star just like Julius Erving
And Roxanne Shanti is only good for steady servin'

Ladies listen up, I really hope you're ready
Cause what I've got to say is far from petty
We've come a long way, baby, so maybe
Shanté can help a sister that's way be-
hind, lost in the mind and can't find
Her way to a better day, you know the kind
So wrapped up in fairy tale dreams
So naive that every male seems
Honest and loyal ready, to spoil
Buyin him gifts as if the boy's loyal
But Shanté is here just to say a few things
Some you heard before, but some are new things
So lend me your ears
Dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers
For the years
Of the independent woman
(Yeah)
(Louder)
[VERSE 2]
How many runny-nose kids can you have
How many nights can you work on the ave.
Your so-called man has a car and a Visa
He's livin large while you're livin on pizza
Unemployed while you wait for the perfect mate
Let's get one thing straight cause it's gettin late
What you're waitin for is really never comin
No one hears the sorry tunes that you're hummin
I'm here to bring the news, that if you're singin the blues
Everyday, it will not change the views
That people have of you, they say you're lost
Nobody forced you to quit, your future's tossed
You put your faith in the guys with the hazel eyes
You thought you would get a prize, all you got was lies
Now you're stuck in a room with a mopping broom
Did you assume that one day you will find a groom?
Are you dizzy, who would ever marry you?
You're lookin for a man that will carry you
And buy you nice things, like diamond rings
You're amazed at the truth that my rhymin brings
But the truth is the only way you'll ever see
That the life that you're hopin for will never be
But the race isn't over, put down the rope
Shanté is here to say there's still hope
So lend me your ears
Dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers
For the years
Of the independent woman
(Yeah)
(Louder)
[VERSE 3]
So much to live for, she wants to die
Life's full of pitfalls, maybe that's why
Her pops went to jail, her mother tapped her vein
City took custody and trapped her in pain
Feelin so alone in the room with a stranger
Hates her own blood and nothing's gonna change her
Angry at the world cause it doesn't play fair
So much dispair does she feel, no one to care
Not a single family member will remember her
Smoke's in her eyes, and the past is a blur
She's on her own now, livin with some other girls
With the same damn lives, but from a different world
These girls are lost, how the city is full of fools
So many years, no guidings, and no kinda rules
No love to give
Yo, they need love to live
If not instead
They'll ponder in a bed
Sex is the thing that makes her feel wanted
Love and care, for she's undaunted
Because whoever is laying there won't really matter
Such a sad song when young dreams shatter
I really don't think glue is gonna fix it
But homegirl can walk the right path if she picks it
So lend me your ears
Dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers
For the years
Of the independent woman
(Yeah)
(Louder)
[VERSE 4]
The black woman role grows larger each day
Nothing in the way so what we teach may
Somehow help those young sisters that doze
And sleepwalk through life with their eyes closed
You don't need a man, all you need is to know you can
Then you can stand on your own two feet and
Achieve anything that you want out of life
Do for yourself, then you can be a wife
And you'll feel so good that you wanna shout
Because you got to the top and got there without
Relyin on Tom, Dick, or Billy Dee
You don't have to turn the lights on to really see
So lend me your ears
Dry up your tears
And let's hear the cheers
For the years
Of the independent woman
Independent woman

""A world premiere...."") [echoes]
Well, my name is Roxanne, a-don't ya know
I just a-cold rock a party, and I do this show
I said I met these three guys, and you know that's true
A-let me tell you and explain them all to you:
I met this dude with the name of a hat
I didn't even walk away, I didn't give him no rap
But then he got real mad, and he got a little tired
If he worked for me, you know he would be fired
His name is Kangol, and that is cute
He ain't got money, and he ain't got the loot
And every time that I see him, he's always a-beggin'
And all the other girls that he's always tryin' to leggin'
Every time that he sees me, he says a rhyme
But, see, compared to me it's weak compared to mine
A-every time I know that I am sayin' somethin' fresher
In any category I'm considered the best
And every time that I say it there ain't nothin' less
And everybody knows I will win the contest
So, then, after that came the Educated Rapper
His fingers started snappin', and my hands start to clappin'
Every time-a that I see him, everything he say
A-every time he says, he says it dumber this way:
He said-a, ""Yeah, you know your mother's name is Mary,""
But all he wanna do is just-a bust a cherry
Every time that I see him, he's sayin' somethin' new
But let me explain to him what he should do:
He should be like me, a fly MC
Don't never have to bite, we're always right
I have the freshest rhymes that I do recite
And after that, and you know it's true
Well, let me tell you somethin' else about the Doctor, too:
He ain't really cute, and he ain't great
He don't even know how to operate
He came up to me with some bullshit rap
But let me tell you somethin' 'cause you know it was wack
So when he came up to me, I told him to step back
He said, ""You call yourself an MC?"" I said, ""This is true,""
He said, ""Explain to me really what MCs must do.""
I said, ""Listen very close 'cause I don't say this every day:
My name is Roxanne, and they call me ShantŽ.""
But every time-a I say a rhyme-a just-a like-a this-a
It's something that you MCs just won't-a miss-a
And if you think it's cute-a, and you think it's all right
But, see, you said it in a language so you wouldn't have to bite
You started talkin' Pig Latin, didn't make no sense
You thought you was cute, yeah, you thought you was a prince
You're walkin' down the block, holdin' your jock
But everybody knows that you're all on my yacht
I'm just the devastatin', always rockin', always have the niggas clockin'
Everybody knows it's me, yeah, the R-O-X-A-N-N-E, yeah
Down with everybody fresh and everyone that I possess
And every time I do it right-a, everyone is sure to bite-a
Every time I do it, yeah, you know it is-a me-a
Rockin' on the beat-a that you can see
And every time I have a DJ like Ice
He ain't right, yeah, he ain't nice
Because a-everything he does is off-the-wall
Compared to my man Marley Marl
The way he gets on the tables, yes
Everyone knows that he is fresh
So, the UTFO crew, you know what you can do
Lemme tell you one for me, and then I'll tell you one for you
Every time you sayin' somethin' just-a like-a this-a
It ain't nothin' that I don't wanna miss-a
And if you're thinkin' that I'm bitin' your beat
Well, then you just better know, and a-listen to me
Because my name is Roxanne-a, and I came to say
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and I do it every day
I'm conceited, never beated, never heard of defeated
I'm rockin' to the beat-a, and you know it is-a me-a:
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E-a
And if you wanna play a little game for me
Lemme show you what you can do, baby
'Cause with a twist of my cheek, and a twist of my wrist
I have all the niggas droppin' down like this
Yeah, I am fly but don't take this
And everybody knows I don't go for it
So, if you're tryin' to be cute and you're tryin' to be fine
You need to cut it out 'cause it's all in your mind
Tryin' to be like me, yeah, is very hard
You think you are God, but you do eat lard
Tryin' to be cute, and you're tryin' to be fly
Don't you know you wish you could be my guy?
So I can take you home, make you relax
And everybody knows that you're out there, tryin' to tax
Like corn-on-the-cob, you're always tryin' to rob
You need to be out there, get yourself a job
Yeah, you're tryin' to be in search of a Roxanne
But lemme let ya know--you're not a real man
'Cause a Roxanne needs a man, and yes:
Someone fresh who always address
Someone, yeah, who will never fess
And then I'll say, yeah, the rest
'Cause everybody knows how the story goes
There's no ifs, no ands, no buts, or suppose
No coke up your nose, no dope in your vein
And then it won't cause no kind of pain
But yet, and still, you're tryin' to be fly
I ask you a question, I wanna know why:
Why'd ya have to make a record 'bout me
The R-O-X-A-N-N-E?
(""Roxanne, Roxanne, {""Oh, my goodness!""}
I wanna be your man
Roxanne, Roxanne
And here's our game-plan!"")

Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able

Going coast to coast watching all the girlies shaking

Another bottle in the brain
Another girl another fight
Another drive all night

We're thrashing hotels like it's going out of style
Gettin'paid along the way cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor Adrock's out the door

With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back

Ain't seen the light since we started this band

Got limos arena the TV shows

It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the dr. hfuhruhurr ale
I've got nothing to lose and so I'm pissin? on the third rail
Groggy eyed and fried and I'm headed for the station
D-train ride the coney island vacation this one's
Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstyle I lost my last token
Riding between the cars pissing smoking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman tell my homeboy yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And the you read the new york post fulton st. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going placed on the d-train stop that train, I wanna get off...
Check it...
Trench coat wing tip going to work
And you be pulling a train like your captain kirk
Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from bernie goetz
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the sliding door
Now your stuck between the stations and it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
A $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise your lees I creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are dunkin
Friday night and jamaica queens funkin
Elevated platform I'm never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth with busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man reading el diario
Riding the train down from the el barrio
Went from the station to orange julius
I bought a hot dog from who george drakoulias
D) year and a day
M.c. for what I am and do
The a is for adam and the lyrics; true
So as pray and hope and the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three the unstoppable three
Me and adam and d. were born to m.c.
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take the center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special
I am the one and I am the master
I am the king and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass
I drop the l. when I'm skiing
I'm smoking and peaking
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop the mindfuck when it's rolling along
Can't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong
Broke my bindings the lion with wings
Preaching his word in the b. boy sing
I am one with myself as I turn to the
I prefer the dreams to reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day
Come what may
I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the bass ale with the guiness stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
And I am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody were testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages
Easy rhyme for the disco dave
He goes by the name of disco dave
Disco dave...
E) hello brooklyn
Hello brooklyn...
New york new york it's a hell of a town
You know the bronx is up and I'm brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job I cut my hair
You know I cut my boss because I don't care
You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off
I'm a buffalo soldier broader than broadway
Keep keepin? on I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud I disturb my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
Cause I am the holder of the 3-pack bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the 3-pack bonanza
If you ask a question you will get your answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
M.o.n.e.y. the belt
I stay at home just like a hermit
I got the jammy but I don't got the permit
You know why
You got a boyfriend and his name is nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick
I ride around town cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in brooklyn *just to watch him die*
Take p.c.p.
F) dropping names
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
She's slippin through his fingers as she's movin? out to the coast
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
Well if your world was all black and if your world was all white
Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right
I'm nicknamed shamrock but my name is not shamus
Girlies on the tip cause my homie is famous
My name is not o'houigheighi nor is it brian
If I said that I was weak man you know I'd be a lion
Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it
Yea explain to a musician them knew it, but them can't do
G) lay it on me
Agh, funky baby
Lay it on me now...
Not so hard man...
Yo,
I got chinese eyes and chinese suits
Smokin? much buddha and smokin? much boots
More updated on the hip-hop lingo
My favorite new york knick was hawthorne wingo
Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card
Man you know that it said napoleon bonaparte
Peepin? out the colors I be buggin? on cezanne
They call me mike d joe blow the lover man well
Your face turns red as your glass of wine
That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time
Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum
Cause I got more flavor than fruit striped gum
With that big round butt of yours
I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin?
Serve you on a platter like thanksgiving stuffin?
And what it
Stuffin?, stuffin?
Stuffin? buddy...
H) mike on the mic
Here's another one for y'all to pee
It's called m.i.k.e. on the m.i.c.
C.
I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the red lobster
Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way then they're going to finish me
You might know this but you've never been this see
If I ate spinach then I'd be called spinach d
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like a raymond burr
I'm so high that they call me your highness
If you don't know me then pardon my shyness
I live in the village wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it
I) a.w.o.l.
Dj hurricane...
When mike d's in the house, what you gonna do
I go a.w.o.l.
Adrock's in the house, what you gonna do
I go a.w.o.l.

Well now don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Got numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because I'm so versatile
Style profile I said
It always brings me back when I hear Ooh Child
From the Hudson River out to the Nile
I run the marathon just up until the very last mile
Well if you battle me I will revile
People always say my style is wild
You've got gall you've got guile guile
To step to me I'm a rapophile
If you want to battle you're in denial
Coming from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead put my rhymes on trial
Cast you off into exile
""Intergalactic Planetary Planetary Intergalactic""

Jazz and Awol that's our team
Step inside the party disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats well I'm a fiend
I like my sugar with coffee and cream
Well I gotta' keep it going keep it going full steam
Too sweet to be sour too nice to be mean
Well on the tough guy style I'm not too keen
To try to change the world I will plot and scheme
Mario C likes to keep it clean clean
Gonna' shine like a sunbeam beam
Keep on rappin' cause that's my dream dream
Got an A from Moe Dee for sticking to themes
Now when it comes to envy y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine tine

Well from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
The rhymes will spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is live like an electric shock
I am known to do the Wop wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop flop
Tammy D getting biz on the crop crop
Beastie Boys known to let the beat drop
""Mmmh..drop"" ""Do it""
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If my rap's soup my beats is stock
Step from the tables when I start to chop
I'm a lumber jack DJ Adrock
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shaking and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock

Don't mean to diss
Don't mean to bring static
All you klingons in the fuckin' house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no i didn't retire
I'll snatch you up
With the needle nose pliers
Like mutual of omaha
Got the ill boat
You've never seen before
Gliding in the glades
And like lorne greene
You know i get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like darren or hazel
I'm a mother fucking nick at night with
Classics rerunning that you know all right
Now remain calm no alarm
Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that
I've got friends and family that i respect
When i think i'm too good
They put me in check
So believe when i say i'm no better than you
Except when i rap
So i guess it ain't true
Like that y'all and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out
Said, ""doc what's the condition
I'm a man that's on a mission""
Said, ""son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass
Is an electrician""
Like a scientist
Mmmm when i'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like einstein and the rappin' duke combined
Hey baby bubba now what the deal
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi
Some hot potato
I stole your mic and you won't see it later
Cause i work magic like a magician
I add up like a mathematician
I'm a bank cashier
Engineer
I wear cotton but i don't wear sheer
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip i'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazin'
You're out of phase
And my crews amazin'
We're working on the record yo
So stay patient
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out
Now, i go by the name of the king adrock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like miss piggy
Who moi
I am the one with the clientele.
You say, ""adrock, you rock so well""
I've got class like pink champale
Mca grab the mic before the mic goes stale
Don't test me
They can't arrest me
I'll fake right cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo calm down
You look cable guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip hop b
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put armor all up on your tire
Sport that fresh attire
Tonight we goin' out set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head
And say, ""those were the days""
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

Deep in Brooklyn I ride the elevated trains
Used to ride the D to beat the morning bell
At Edward R. Morrow out on Ave L
We be grillin' cheese and flippin' flapjacks
With the diamond stylus we cutting wax
We're the super elastic bubble plastic
Got ethereal material that's straight up classic
You try to vex reject but you should respect
Or we'll have JC send you out a FedEx * 1
So don't start to flex up in the discotheque
Or we'll make you extinct tyrannosaurus rex
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Your rhyme technique, it is antique
To all my heads Qu'est-ce-que tu fabriques?
Que cosa faI' Come sta e?
Ho fato molte telefonate
Oops gotcha clutch like Plazza
Sneak between the sheets so hide like matzoh
Holler back challah bread... next
We are the crew who put the crew in Cruex
I can see that Def Jam doesn't recognize me
I'm Mike D the one who put the satin in your panties
Time to count MC's in this place to be
Not five, not four, not two, just three
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way
Round-house kick the mic out your hand
Drunken mantis, my name brand
So if you're slick with the tricks and the slight of hand
I'm hip top the shit that you're trying to scam
Gnip Gnop I got shit to pop
I'm an exceptional professional that just don't stop
So pack up your bag and your mic and don't wait
E.T. phone home now get the fuck out my face
You know we shake'em bake'em then we take'em
Treat MCs like leaves go out and rake'em
If you sell our CDs on Canal before we make'em
Then we will have no alternative but to serve you
on a platter like Steak'Em
We're gonna rock this motherfucker like three the hard way

Never sleep alone because Jimmy's the magnet
I'm so rope they call me Mr. Roper
When the troubles arise I'm the cool coper
On the mic I score just like the Yankees
Get over on Ms. Crabtree like my main man Spankee
Excuse me young lady I don't mean to trouble ya
But you're looking mighty fine inside your B.M.W.
I got lucky I brought home a kitten
Before I got busy I schlepped on my mitten
Can't get better odds cause I'm a sure thing
Proud Mary keeps on turning rolling like a Ring Ding
Jump the turnstile never pay the tool
Doo wa diddy bust with the pre-roll
Customs jail me over an herb seed
Don't rat on your boy over some rat weed
Not perfect grammar always perfect timing
The Mike stands for money and the D. is for diamonds
Out of your back door and into another
Your boyfriend doesn't know about me and your mother
Roses are red the sky is blue
I got my barrel at your neck so what the fuck you gonna do
It's just two wheels and me the wind in my eyes
The engine is the music and my nine's by my side
Cause you know why a you see H.
I'm takin' all M.C.'s out of the place
Takin' life as it comes no fool am I
I'm goin' off gettin' paid and I don't ask why
Playin' beats on my box makin' music for the many
Know alota funky girls who like to do their thing
A lot of parents like to think I'm a villain
I'm just chillin' like Bob Dylan
I smoke cheeba it helps me with my brain
I might be a little dusted but I'm not insane
People come up to me and they try to talk shit man
I've been making records since you were sucking on your mother's limp dick
Girl you're walking tall now with your fancy clothes
You got fancy things going up your nose
You get fancy gifts from expensive men
You're a dog on a leash like a pig in a pen
Mothership connection getting girl's affection
If your life needs correction don't follow my direction
You got your 8 by 10 your agent your Harley
You be driving around Hollywood yes sorry charlie
Cause I'm running things like some Mack motherfucker
Your only claim to fame is you're a false fake sucker
You slip you slack you clock me you lack
While I'm reading on the road by my man Jack Kerouac
My veins are like vines
Filled with red wine
Poetry in motion coconut lotion
I had to diss the girl because she got too emotional
Are you experienced little girl
I want to know what goes on in your little girl world
Give time for your mind it's hard to forget me
I'll take your pride for a ride if you let me
So peace out now, and keep peacing out
Full throttle to the bottle and full full clout
And I'm out

I give it my best and say come with may

It's time to speak up and not turn away
Make the sun shine when it's cloudy and gray

Open up your ears and clean out your eyes

It could be nice to be alive
I'm taking doody rhymes to the brand new height
I shine on the mic like UltraBrite
Created a monster with these rhymes I write
Goatee metal rap please say goodnight
Now here's a little something that you might not like
My DJ's name is Mix Master Mike
It's a real pitty that you people got to bite
But i could understand 'cause it sounds so nice
Reading you the news 'cause I'm Country Mike
Use a microphone like Shazam uses tights
Try to keep clear of that hate and spite
So Ikeep my mind still like the still of night
Now who in the world do you want to fight
It's against the system we should unite
Homophobics ain't alright

So many billionaires while so many lacks
So before the poor decide to react
Well Come on party people and share up your stacks
Now i'm a break it down to the brass tacks
Do the Biz Mark dance and the cabbage patch
You try to turn the key but then you broke the latch
Sneak into my files for some rhymes to snatch
I'd like to have a say i'm the income tax
Don't wanna help build bombs and that's the facts
No money for health care so what's the catch
The man got you locked with no key to the latch
Mike and Adam have got my back
You bring the mics and we'll bring the rap
Turn on the P.A. and rock your shack

All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and form
Goto goto goto goto
Don't mess with crack or the baking soda
Whether in the high rise where you live like Roda
Or in the shack and you live like Yoda
Once again it's on like a brand new morn
Beatsie Beatsie Boys here to keep you all warm
All you spazzes and you freaks
Go and do your thing 'cause you're unique
If it don't hurt nobody else than
Don't be afraid to be yourself and
Special dedication and so on
to all lifestyles, sizes, shapes and forms
We gotta keep the party going on
All lifestyles, sizes, shapes, and form

And Then I Fuck It Up And Then I Turn It In
And Then I Turn It Out, Got The Body Rockin' Sound
And Then You Know I'm Gonna Get Down And
Eat A Scooby Snack And Take Disco Nap
Because I'm Shopping At Sears, 'Cause I Don't Buy At The Gap
Sending This One Out To All The Funky Inspirations
Pretty Purdie On The Drums With The Beat Relations
Well, I'm Working On Rhymes, They're Coming Line By Line
Trying To Put What I Feel Into Word And Rhymes
I've Got A Feeling Coming On, I've Got To Make Some Shit
A Little Something Stupid, For The Twisted And Sick
Because I Drive Like A Maniac On The Streets
And I Don't Give Fuck 'Cause I've Got The Beats
Got My Nuts Swingin' From Left To Right And
Right To Left And I'm Death Defying
(Chorus)
I Spin My Fortune On A Wheel Like Sajak
Here's The Payback Keep Going Strong Like Since The Way Back
I Try To Be Myself But I Lose Track
'Cause The Shit Gets Complicated Now I've Got To Get Back
As We Learn To Breed Love For One Another
In These Times Of Melding Cultures
I Give Respect For What's Been Borrowed And Lent
I Know This Music Comes Down From African Descent
Because I Don't Need A Magic Potion
Let Me Talk About Back Field In Motion
My Girls Got Cheeks For Weeks And I'm Happy
You Know I'm A Sneak Like My Old Grand Pappy
I Gotta Give Thanks To My Man Archie Sheep
For Staying True To Inspiration And I Don't Half Step
So I Kick Out The Jams And Tell You Who I Am
And I Talk To The People Like Les Mccann
(Chorus)
I Ask God For A Rhyme Or Two
A Little Something For The Wise As Well As The Fool
A Little Something To Affect A Little Taste Of Change
For The Together And The Strong As Well As the Dearanged
I'll Do You Right Like Bobby Knight
And Then I'm Rapping On The Mic To The Broadway Light
Stomp My Hands, I Clap My Feet And
I'm Bugging Off Yusef Lateef
I Got A Match To My Ass And I'm A Keep It Lit
I Need To Get Some Cash, Call My Accountant Britt
I'm Rushing Around Town Taking Care Of My Functions
Always Got One More Thing So Forget About Function
We Create This World And The Problems Go On
Create Our Lives And The Things That Gor Wrong
So To The Deaf, The Blind, Look Around And Listen
To What It Is You Want And For What You're Wishing
(Chorus)

From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders
We come together on the subway cars
Diversity unified, whoever you are
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L we're doin' swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
'Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must
I remember when the Duece was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIX * 1
At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York I hope you're doing well
I know a lot's happen and you've been through hell
So, we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
The L.I.E. the B.Q.E
Hippies at the band shell with the L.S.D.
Get my BVD's from VIM
You know I'm reppin' Manhattan the best I can
Stopped off at Bleeker Bob's got thrown out
Sneakin' in at 4:00 am after going out
You didn't rob me in the park at Dianna Ross
But everybody started looting when the light went off
From the South South Bronx on out to Queens Bridge
From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side
From 1010 WINS to Live At Five
Dear New York this is a love letter
To you and how you brought us together
We can't say enough about all you do
'Cause in the city were ourselves and electric too
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen
Shout out the South Bronx where my mom hails from
Right next to High Bridge across from Harlem
To the Grand Concourse where my mom and dad met
Before they moved on down to the Upper West
I see you're still strong after all that's gone on
Life long we dedicate this song
Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 911 we're still livin'
And lovin' life we've been given
Ain't nothing gonna take that away from us
Were lookin' pretty and gritty 'cause in the city we trust
Dear New York I know a lot has changed
2 towers down but you're still in the game
Home to many rejecting know one
Accepting peoples of all places, wherever they're from
Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten
From the Battery to the top of Manhattan
Asian, Middle-Eastern and Latin
Black, White, New York you make it happen

You say fuck that yo holmes fuck this
I'm the king ad-whammy and your dick butkus
One half science and the other half soul

Got over on your girlie cause you know she never says no
So just get on the mic
Just get on the mic

At the feaver...
C) stop that train
It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the dr. hfuhruhurr ale
I've got nothing to lose and so I'm pissin? on the third rail
Groggy eyed and fried and I'm headed for the station
D-train ride the coney island vacation this one's
Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
They'll be kicking out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstyle I lost my last token
Riding between the cars pissing smoking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman tell my homeboy yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And the you read the new york post fulton st. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going placed on the d-train stop that train, I wanna get off...
Check it...
Trench coat wing tip going to work
And you be pulling a train like your captain kirk
Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from bernie goetz
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the sliding door
Now your stuck between the stations and it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
A $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise your lees I creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are dunkin
Friday night and jamaica queens funkin
Elevated platform I'm never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth with busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man reading el diario
Riding the train down from the el barrio
Went from the station to orange julius
I bought a hot dog from who george drakoulias
D) year and a day
M.c. for what I am and do
The a is for adam and the lyrics; true
So as pray and hope and the message is sent
And I am living in the dreams that I have dreamt
Because I'm down with the three the unstoppable three
Me and adam and d. were born to m.c.
And my body and soul and mind are pure
Not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
Just lyrics from I to you recited
Arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted
Enter the arena as I take the center stage
The lights set low and the night has come of age
Take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
Speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special
I am the one and I am the master
I am the king and this is my castle
Dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
Seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last
And you can bet your ass
I drop the l. when I'm skiing
I'm smoking and peaking
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
Can't stop the mindfuck when it's rolling along
Can't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong
Broke my bindings the lion with wings
Preaching his word in the b. boy sing
I am one with myself as I turn to the
I prefer the dreams to reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
Don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
But it's good to have turn to be a king for a day
Or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day
Come what may
I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout
Mix the bass ale with the guiness stout
Fishing for a line inside my brain
And looking out at the world through my window pane
Every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained
Everything has changed but remains the same
So once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
And I am going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
Feeling as though somebody were testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
Looking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be
Check the prophetic sections of the pages
Easy rhyme for the disco dave
He goes by the name of disco dave
Disco dave...
E) hello brooklyn
Hello brooklyn...
New york new york it's a hell of a town
You know the bronx is up and I'm brooklyn down
Because they don't know my name only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job I cut my hair
You know I cut my boss because I don't care
You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off
I'm a buffalo soldier broader than broadway
Keep keepin? on I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud I disturb my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
Cause I am the holder of the 3-pack bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the 3-pack bonanza
If you ask a question you will get your answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
M.o.n.e.y. the belt
I stay at home just like a hermit
I got the jammy but I don't got the permit
You know why
You got a boyfriend and his name is nick
Annabelle caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick
I ride around town cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in brooklyn *just to watch him die*
Take p.c.p.
F) dropping names
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
She's slippin through his fingers as she's movin? out to the coast
He thrusts his fists against the post and still insists he sees a ghost
Well if your world was all black and if your world was all white
Then you wouldn't get much color out of life now right
I'm nicknamed shamrock but my name is not shamus
Girlies on the tip cause my homie is famous
My name is not o'houigheighi nor is it brian
If I said that I was weak man you know I'd be a lion
Suckers try to bite they try to pursue it
Yea explain to a musician them knew it, but them can't do
G) lay it on me
Agh, funky baby
Lay it on me now...
Not so hard man...
Yo,
I got chinese eyes and chinese suits
Smokin? much buddha and smokin? much boots
More updated on the hip-hop lingo
My favorite new york knick was hawthorne wingo
Met a girl at a party and I gave her my card
Man you know that it said napoleon bonaparte
Peepin? out the colors I be buggin? on cezanne
They call me mike d joe blow the lover man well
Your face turns red as your glass of wine
That you spilled on my lyrics as you wasted my time
Girl you should be with me you should drop that bum
Cause I got more flavor than fruit striped gum
With that big round butt of yours
I'd like to butter your muffin I'm not bluffin?
Serve you on a platter like thanksgiving stuffin?
And what it
Stuffin?, stuffin?
Stuffin? buddy...
H) mike on the mic
Here's another one for y'all to pee
It's called m.i.k.e. on the m.i.c.
C.
I met this girl last night with a peculiar cackle
I laid the bait and then she took the tackle
Had too much to drink at the red lobster
Now the room is spinning around like the blades of a helicopter
I never met a girl that was too finicky
If the press has their way then they're going to finish me
You might know this but you've never been this see
If I ate spinach then I'd be called spinach d
I shed light like cats shed fur
Ride around town like a raymond burr
I'm so high that they call me your highness
If you don't know me then pardon my shyness
I live in the village wherever I go I walk to
I keep my friends around so I have someone to talk to
I play my music loud because you know it's got clout to it
It's a trip it's got a funky beat and I can bug out to it
I) a.w.o.l.
Dj hurricane...
When mike d's in the house, what you gonna do
I go a.w.o.l.
Adrock's in the house, what you gonna do

We're so damn hard we never sweat
A gonna' rock gonna' roll we'll take control
But if ya had to rock the mic it's in the soul
In the heart in the mind it'll make you blind
It'll make the other rappers a drop the time
Do you mind huh.. It can take you home
And teach you how to fess on the microphone
MCA
M-A-C-I-N-G
I'm a messing on the mic at all the cool parties
I've been on the mic in Rome and Capri
And all the fine women italian fell in love with me
Now Mike D.'s strool, stealin the show
I say come on Mike D. lets flash some dough
On the go all of the time
When you're rappin your rhyme you know you ring my chime
And now he's the one who's gonna show you how to dance
The King AdRock, don't give him a chance
When he starts to dance, the ladies gather around
The King AdRock, he's gonna' get down
He'll bust the know how to do it to you
Just four fresh folks and we form a fresh crew
AdRock just make that move
Just rock to the rythme on the Beastie groove
I say K-I-N-G A-D Rock
You know the whole world is on my jock
I got girls at the Met on the T.I.P.
And I will do it to you Eddie know it's you I please
Cause I'm a man who needs no introduction
Got a big tool of reproduction
Bouncin' in your ears what you always wishin'
For the day to come when I start to dishin'
On your body, yes your mind
Just take another and get in line
Cause when I get you into bed you know I sue
Then you'll know the real meaning of the Beastie groove
And now something new a double time cool rhyme
From my boy AdRock sendin' tickels up your spine
Suck on this this beat rocks tiny
A B-E-A-S-T-I-E well everyone knows me
You know that I can surely be the number one in frequency
I'm hip I'm hopin I'm takin' time
For everyone that's on my jock
You know that I can surely rock
I like to talk I take the time
Turn it in I turn it out
Makin' rhymes, screem and shout
King of the mic I rock
I know how to turn you on just like a light
I'm number one and I'm the one
King AdRock of physico to the last
Is the day of the Beastie groove
So bet the fly rhymes to make you move
Everybody in the world who ever you are
You better get ready D.T. double R huh...
""That's right""
""Hey, hey mom""
Mike D.
Just make that move
Just rock to the rythm of the Beastie groove
Well I'll put it to you I'm Mike D.
I'm rappin' on the mic anumber one MC
When I'm on the go I put the ball in the hoop
I throw you ten bucks as I do the allie-oop
Just throw me the ball, and watch me get down
I'll take you for a sucker and I'll throw you to the ground
Take that if you think you can
Meet the floor and that to this here rap
Now you know you can bust that move
Everybody dance to the Beastie groove
MCA
Just make that move
Just rock to the rythm of the Beastie groove
Come on georgous pretty little french fly girlie
See me standin on the stage and wanna tour around the world
If you wanna see some more when I'm not on the floor
Just come on back stage and I'll tell you how to turn it
You don't know what to do, I'll do it to you
Well just a take off your clothes and start the boogaloo
Now all the nice ladies, all say please
Please
And I'll know that's me
MCA makin' the party
with the ultimate rhymes from tip to bass
Just doin those ladies all over the place
On the floor, in the back, and if I'm doin lack
Just a put 'em in a line layin on their back
And then I'll do them all one at a time
MCA so loose with the rhyme
Ohh....
The Beastie groove

I Praise The Buddhas As They Shine
I Bow Before You As I Travel My Path
To Join Your Ranks I Make My Full Time Task
For The Sake Of All Beings I Seek
The Enlighted Mind That I Know
I'll Reap
Respect To Shantideva And All The Others
Who Brought Down The Darma For Sisters And Brothers
I Give Thanks For This World As A Place To Learn
And For This Human Body That I Know I've Earned
And My Deepest Thanks To All Sentient Beings
For Without Them There Would Be No Place To Learn What I'm Seeing
There's Nothing Here That's Not Been Said Before
But Though I Put It Down Now So That I'll Be Sure
To Solidify My Own Views
And I'll Be Glad If It Helps Anyone Else Out Too
If Others Disrespect Me Or Give Me Flack
I'll Stop And Think Before I React
Knowing That They're Going Through Insecure Stages
I'll Take The Opportunity To Exercise Patience
I'll See It As A Chance To Help The Other Person
Nip It In The Bud Before It Can Worsen
A Change For Me To Be Strong And Sure
As I Think On The Buddhas Who Have Come Before
As I Praise And Respect The Good They've Done
Knowing Only Love Can Conquer In Every Situation
We Need Other People In Order To Create
The Circumstances For The Learning That We're Here To Generate
Situations That Bring Up Our Deepest Fears
So We Can Work To Release Them Until They're Cleared
Therefore It Only Makes Sense
To Thank Our Enemies Despite Their Intent
The Bodhisattva Path Is One Of Power And Strength
A Strength From Within To Go The Length
Seeing Others Are As Important As Myself
I Strive For A Happiness Of Mental Wealth
With The Interconnectedness That We Share As One
Every Action That We Take Affects Everyone
So In Deciding For What A Situation Calls
There Is A Path For The Good For All
I Try To Make My Every Action For That Highest Good
With The Altruistic Wish To Achive Buddhahood
So I Pledge Here Before Everyone Who's Listening
To Try To Make My Every Action For The Good Of All Beings
For The Rest Of My Lifetimes And Even Beyond
I Vow To Do My Best To Do No Harm
And In Times Of Doubt I Can Think On The Dharma
And The Enlightened Ones Who've Graduated Samsara

Possession is half the law
I had my routines before all y'all
Your whole life is comin' apart at the seams
You ain't nothing but a car thief biting routines
See I'm a city slicker I ain't no townie
Right now I wish I had another hash brownie

Or Mookie's gonna kick your motherfuckin' ass

I'm a writer a poet a genius I know it
I don't buy cheeba I grow it
""I'm a farmer""
People always trying to get next to me
I had a beautiful experience on ecstasy
I smoked up a bag of elephant tranquilizer
Because I had to deal with a money hungry miser
Had a caine filled Kool with my man Rush Rush
Saw my teeth fall in the sink when I started to brush
You be doing nose candy on the Bowie Coke Mirror
My girl asked for some but I pretended not to hear her
You can't deny me you always want to try me
Yo you're just gonna get your ass kicked
Homeboy throw in the towel
Your girl got dicked by Ricky Powell
The Godfather of Soul in the belly of the beast
Smokin' that dust at St. Anthony's Feast
All the wife beaters and all the tax cheaters
Sitting in the White House pulling their peters
Buy my cheeba from the cop down the street
The only cop with a rope chain with the walking the beat
So like a sneaky pouch time bomb tickin'
Like the beat to my rhyme just kickin'
Space cake cookies I discover who I am
I'm a dusted old bummy Hurdy Gurdy Man
Five-O caught me now I'm going to the mountains
Said good-bye to my girl my lawyers and accountants
My mind is kinda' rhymin' and I think I oughta think
So I'm rockin all the rhymes and I'll have another drink
So the lights are flashing my mind is spinning
I feel like it is always the beginning
Of another rhyme I'm rappin' MC'in' I rock
You ain't nothing but a car thief who must be stopped

Well..
It's 4:00 a.m. I've got the Dr. Hfuhruhurr Ale
I've got nothing to lose so I'm pissin' on the third rail
Groggy eyed and fried I'm headed for the station
D-Train ride Coney Island vacation
Dedicated to the boofers in the back of the 1 train
They'll be kickin' out windows high on cocaine
And then I jump the turnstyle I lost my last token
Riding between the cars pissin' smokin'
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy yo put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
And then you read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going placed on the D-Train
""Stop that train I wanna' get off""
""Stop that train I wanna' get off""
Check it..
Trench coat wing tip going to work
And you be pulling a train like Captain Kirk
Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
I caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the slide doors
Now you're stuck between the stations and it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
A $50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise the Lees I creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin'
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin'
Elevated platform I'm never gonna' conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin' El Diario
Riding the train down from the El Barrio
Went from the station to Orange Julius
I Bought a hot dog from who George Drakoulias

Blowin' doors off hinges

And no i didn't retire
I'll snatch you up
With the needle nose pliers
Like mutual of omaha
Got the ill boat
You've never seen before
Gliding in the glades
And like lorne greene
You know i get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like darren or hazel
I'm a mother fucking nick at night with
Classics rerunning that you know all right
Now remain calm no alarm
Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that
I've got friends and family that i respect
When i think i'm too good
They put me in check
So believe when i say i'm no better than you

Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip i'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf

You're out of phase
And my crews amazin'
We're working on the record yo
So stay patient
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out
Now, i go by the name of the king adrock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like miss piggy
Who moi
I am the one with the clientele.
You say, ""adrock, you rock so well""
I've got class like pink champale
Mca grab the mic before the mic goes stale
Don't test me
They can't arrest me
I'll fake right cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo calm down
You look cable guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip hop b
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put armor all up on your tire
Sport that fresh attire
Tonight we goin' out set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head
And say, ""those were the days""
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfuckin' party out

I got more product than Ron Popeil
So deal with that troop were troopers
The only air time you get is on bloopers
Beatsie Boys in the place up in the space
So renovate or evacuate
You better think twice before you start flossing
I been in your bathroom often
Taking punk MC's out I'm all about
My to do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here no room to breath
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep
No I'm not Herman Munster or Dr. Spock
I go by the name of the King Adrock
So here's a match my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you dog;
I'm in your crawl space
You're in front of my house and you know that's wack
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay like Vader sip you for a first course
Don't even get me started on intercourse...
A 14! 9
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery
The way you act a fool son you can't erase
I'll have you running on your way like steeple chase
You tried to take my title now put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace
Steeling my style from my trophy case
But my drive's secure like an army base
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
But you ain't never gonna catch me;
I'm in your crawl space
Schematics, blueprints and microfilm
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
'Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
And this extends beyond the Tri-State-Area
Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shall?
'Cause these rhymes are zoo proof
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
'Cause were not buying what you're selling
First you want to battle then you start to whine
You're looking hungry, it must be snack time
So run home where you feel safe
But don't sleep Cochise;
I'm in your crawl space

You can't bring me down to a world of self pitty
Lot's of ways to deal with it
Gotta' deal with it

Deal with it
You do unto others like they're pieces of shit
A rightous man who's flipping the script
There's plenty of room for everyone at the table
So check yourself before you check the label

Not enough time to always stay mad

But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found
It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
It's just the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles
Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes
Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes So..
Can I get a witness to testify
Open your eyes realize electrify
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes
It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses
And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways
To the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today
With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong
Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed
A set back ain't all that much problem to invade
So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight
But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed Uh..
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes realize electrify
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""
""Electrify-Electrify-Ele-Electrify""

You wake up late for school man you don't wanna' go
You ask your mom please but she still says No
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
You gotta' fight for your right to party
Your pop caught you smoking and he said, No way
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag
Bust it..
You gotta' fight for your right to party
You gotta' fight
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said What's that noise
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys
You gotta' fight for your right to party
You gotta' fight for your right to party

I've Got Bigger Buns Than My Man Paul Bunyon's
I've Been Going Nuts Gettin' All Cooped Up
Fully Hermitizing But Now I'm Getting Souped Up

I've Got More Spice Than The Frugal Gourmet

Show These Good People What It Means To Be D
Well They Call Me Mike D With The Mad Man Style
I Put The Mic Up To My Lips And I Can Scream For A While

I've Got The Light Bulb Flashing At The Top Of My Head
Never Wake Up On The Wrong Side Of The Bed
You're An Idea Man Not A Yes Man
With A Point To Make You're Bound To Take A Stand

You Know The Bass Is Real Fat Because It's Gotta Be Like That
A Snare On The Funky Tin And A Taste Of The High Hat
Yo Yauch What's Up Mike D What's Up
Come On Yauch, Let's Tear It Up
I Could Catch A Groove Like A Flash In The Dark
Grab A Hold Of Your Attention Like A Thief In The Park
'Cause I Can Flip A Rhyme Off The Tip Of My Tongue
Switching Up The Rhythm Like The Rhyme's A Piece Of Chewing Gum
Now I Might Chew But I Don't Bite
My Ideas Are Mine When I Begin To Write
In My Sleep I'll Be Thinking 'Bout Beats
And Getting On The Mic And Busting Some Treats
And Sporting The Crazy Funky Threads That You've Never Even Seen Before
What I'm Lacking From The Macking I Can Find At The Thrift Store
I Won't Scuff Nor Scuffle Just Grin As They Walk By
Take Time To Rhyme For A Girl I Hear Talk Fly
Down Some Papaya Down With The Revolution
Always Wear My Goggles 'Cause There's So Much Pollution
I Can Do The Freak, The Patty Duke And The Spank
Gotta Free The Funky Fish From The Funky Fish Tanks
I'll Sell My House, Sell My Car And I'll Sell All My Stuff
I'm Going Back To New York City I Do Believe I've Had Enough

"158","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/beastie_boys/flowin_prose-lyrics-6291.html","beastie_boys","Flowin' Prose ","I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies
The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Over and over I fall I learned to walk from a crawl
It's not sad it's just the way and the purpose of it all
Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects
Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine
Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings
I give in and I win I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then they set the stage
But I'll remain sane making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as painstaking as it is
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back cause that's the way I've got to live
So like a cloud carries rain I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightening timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine no ploys or scams
Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind was on a rhyme scheme
What can I do with these bones and flesh?
With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range
I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Gravy and King
His Holiness and all enlightened beings
I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home
But the words ain't mine I just pass em along
For Betty Williams and her friends I sing this song
And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
And more crimes are committed as I say these lines
""Youth enough, we put down the gun""

Back in the day
There was this girl around the way
She liked by home-piece MCA
He said he would not give her play
I asked him, Please, he said, You may
Her pants were tight and that's okay
If she would dance I would DJ
We took a walk down to the bay
I hope she'll say
Hey me and you should hit the hay
I asked her out she said No way
I should have probably guessed her gay
So I broke North with no delay
I heard she moved real far away
That was two years ago this May
I seen her just the other day
Jockin' Mike D. to my dismay
Girls to do the dishes
Girls to clean up my room
Girls to do the laundry
Girls and in the bathroom

The Bronx is up and I'm Brooklyn down
They don't know my name they only know my initials
Building bombs in the attic for elected officials
I quit my job I cut my hair
I cut my boss cause I don't care
You tried to get slick you bust a little chuckle
You're gonna get smacked with my gold finger knuckle
Cause being as fly as me is something you never thought of
You'll be sticking up old ladies with the hand gun or the sawed-off
Like a buffalo soldier I'm broader than Broadway
Keep keepin' on I don't care what they say
I play my stereo loud it disturbs my neighbors
I want to enjoy the fruits of my labor
I am the holder of the 3-pack Bonanza
If you open the book then you will get your hand slapped
I am the keeper of the 3-pack Bonanza
If you ask a question you will get the answer
Her breast I saw I reached I felt
M.O.N.E.Y. the belt
I stay at home just like a hermit
I got the jammy but I don't got the permit
Yes you got a boyfriend and indeed his name is Slick Nick
that is why Annabelle you're caught with the shrimpy limp dick trick
I ride around town cause my ride is fly
I shot a man in Brooklyn *just to watch him die*

Look give it back you're wicky wack
With your ticky tack calls didn't touch you at all
I didn't touch your hand man you know its all ball
You sold a few records but don't get slick
'Cause you used a corked bat to get those hits
You've been in the game, your career is long
But when you break it down you've only got 2 songs
MC's are like clay pigeons and I'm shootn' skeet
I just yell pull and MMM drops the beat
You people call yourselves MC's but you're garbage men
Takin' out the trash when you pull out the pen
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
I read about you up on page 6
They was trashin' your ass it's sad you're getting dissed
Now talk about your face now don't get pissed
But I suggest you see a dermatologist
I keep that hot sauce hot not mild and weak
It's gonna burn your mouth until you wet your beak
I've got billions and billions of rhymes to flex
'Cause I've got more rhymes than Carl Sagan's got turtlenecks
Your rhymes are fake like a Canal Street watch
You're hearing me and you're like ""oh my god its Sasquatch!""
I'm walkin' on water while you're stepping in shit
So put your sewer boots on before your ass gets lit
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!
So put a quarter in your ass cause you played yourself
Sucker MC's it's me they're resenting
In the animal kingdom they call it presenting
With the dipsy doodle the kit and caboodle
The truth is brutal your grandma's kugel
Kings County is my stomping ground
The Albee Square Mall, Brooklyn, Downtown
So don't ask me to wine and dine ya
I'm from Brooklyn you're from Regina
You're like Foghorn Leghorn, Yosemite Sam
You're just yellin' and wildin' wondering who I am
With those lies you're telling you look like Toucan Sam
But my style's impregnable like the Hoover Dam
And if you don't like then hey fuck you!

Hey ladies in the place I'm callin' out to ya
There never was a city kid truer and bluer
There's more to me than you'll ever know
And I've got more hits than Sadaharu Oh
Ton Thumb Tom Cushman or Tom Foolery
Date women on T.V. with the help of Chuck Woolery
Words are flowing out just like the Grand Canyon
And I'm always out looking for a female companion
I threw the lasso around the tallest one and dragged her to the crib
I took off her moccasins and put on my bib
I'm wheelin' and dealin' I make a little bit of stealing
I'll bring you back to the place and your dress I'm peeling
Your body's on time and your mind is appealing
Staring at the cracks up there upon the ceiling
Such and such will be the bass that I'm throwing
I'm talking to a girl telling her I'm all knowing well..
She's talking to the kid to the kid
I'm telling here every lie that you know that I never did
""Hey ladies"" ""a get funky""
""All the ladies in the house""
""The ladies the ladies""
Well...
Me in the corner with a good looking daughter
I dropped my drawers and said ""welcome back Kotter""
We was cutting up the rug she started cutting up the carpet
In my apartment I begged her please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a crab
Educated no stupid yep
And when I say stupid I mean stupid ""fresh""
I'm not James at 15 or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville then
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records' a number one sound
Just step to the rhythm step step to the ride
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside
Tune in tune on to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like fish to my line
""Hey ladies"" ""a get funky""
Hey hey hey hey ladies
""Girls girls..""
Hey hey hey hey ladies
One more time ""any funky now""
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey ladies
""Any funky..""
You know that..
She's got a gold tooth you know she's hardcore
She'll show you a good time then she'll show you the door
Break up with your girl it ended in tears
Vincent Van Gogh go and mail that ear
Call her in the middle of the night when I'm drinkin'
The phone booth on the corner is damp and it's stinkin'
Said come on over it was me that she missed
I threw that trash can through her window cause you know I got dissed
Your old lady left you and you went (girls girls girls) insane
You blew yourself up in the back of the 6 train well...
Take my advice at any price a gorilla like your mother is mighty weak man
Sucking down pints till I didn't know
Woke up in the morning at the one Ton Ho
Cause I announce I like girls that bounce
With the weight that pays about a pound per ounce
Girls with curls and big long locks
And beatnik chicks just wearing their smocks
Walking high and mighty like she's number one
""She thinks she's the passionate one""
""Hey ladies"" ""a get funky""
""What's that""
""Good god
""Good god"" ""damn""
""Good god""
""Baby baby baby baby""
""Is it funky brother""
""Hee haa haa haa...""

The high plains drifter And I'm the drifter
They can't catch me never gonna find me
They're never gonna know that I'm the High Plains Drifter
Pulled over to the river to take a rest
Pulled out a pair of pliers and pulled the bullet out of my chest
Fear and loathing across the country listening to my 8 track
I reached behind the seat to snatch a cool one from the pack
A long distance from my girl and I'm talking on the cellular
She said that she was sorry and I said yeah the hell you were
Check the rear view mirror check the gold tooth display
Check the odometer and I was on my way
Cause I'm the high plains drifter the best that you can get
A strapped shoplifter a pirate on cassette
Bust a Travis Bickle when I feel that I'm getting pushed
Don't step to me 'cause you're gonna get mushed cinaster..
I'm doin' 120 plowing over mail boxes
Radar detector to tell me where the cops is
Spend another night at the Motel 6
It's five dollars extra get the porno flicks and then I..
Concoct a black and tan in my brandy snifter
I'm a kleptomaniac K-Mart shoplifter
Cash flow getting low so I had to pull a job
I found a nice place to visit but a better place to rob
I left my car outside and the engine still revvin'
Time to get busy (takin' care of business) at 7-Eleven
And then I went inside to make my withdrawal
I saw all that he had but I had to take it all
Knucklehead deli tried to gyp me on the price
So I clocked him off the turban with the bag of ice
'Cause I'm mellow like Jell-O cool like lemonade
I made my getaway and then I thought that I had it made
I feel like Steve McQueen a former movie star
Look in my rearview mirror seen a police car
Ballantine quarts with the puzzle on the cap
I couldn't help but notice I was caught in a speed trap
Dirty Mary Crazy Larry on the run from Dirty Harry
Stash the cash in the dash but my gun I did carry
I'm seeing blue and red flashing deep in the night
I got my alibi straight and I pulled over to the right
The cop knocked on my window and said Boy where's the fire
You've got a mailbox on your bumper and a bald front tire
""Outta the car longhair"" your goose is cooked
Read me my rights fingerprinted and booked
Makin' like a D.T. driving a Gran Fury
Wherever I hang my hat's my home and my past is kind of blurry
Every dog will have its day and mine will be in front of a jury
I'm the High Plains Drifter you know I'm never in a hurry
Read me my rights as if I didn't know this
Threw me in the tank with the drunk called Otis
With his five o' clock shadow he smelled of 3-day old beer
My man turned to me and said why are you here?
I said I'm charmin' I'm dashing I'm rental car bashin'
Phony paper passing at Nix Check Cashing
I went before the judge he sent me to the Brooklyn House of D.
He said you behave or we'll throw away the key
Houdini'd out the cuffs I kicked the screw in the knee
I took the bailiff's wallet and went straight to O.T.B.
I had a good feeling easy come easy go
I bet on one horse to win and another just for show
And sure enough that nag came in
Brought my ticket to the window and collected my win
And then I broke into my new car with a wire coat hanger
Hot wired hot wheeled and ""Suzy is a headbanger""

When I fill my pockets with a knot of dollar bills
Sipping pints of ale out the window sill
When I get my fill I'm chilly chill
Now I just got home because I'm out on bail
What's the time it's time to buy ale
Peter eater parking meter all of the time
If I run out of ale it's Thunderbird wine

My name's Mike D. and I write my own snaps
I'm a peep-show seeking on the forty-deuce
I'm a killer at large and I'm on the loose
Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from
Cheap-skate, perpetrating money hungry jerk
Everyday I drink OE and I don't go to work

Pump it up homeboy just don't stop
Chef Boy-ar-dee cooling on the pot
I take no slack cause I got the knack
I'm never dusting out cause I tossed that crack

In a world gone mad it's hard to think right
So much violence hate and spite
Murder going on all day and night
Due time we fight the non-violent fight
Mirrors, smokescreens and lies
It's not the politicians but their actions I despise
You and Saddam should kick it like back in the day
With the cocaine and Courvoisier
But you build more bombs as you get more bold
As your mid-life crisis war unfolds
All you want to do is take control
Now put that axis of evil bullshit on hold
Citizen rule number 2080
Politicians are shady
So people watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it look at how they act
[Chorus]
First the 'War On Terror' now war on Iraq
We're reaching a point where we can't turn back
Let's lose the guns and let's lose the bombs
And stop the corporate contributions that their built upon
Well I'll be sleeping on your speeches 'til I start to snore
'Cause I won't carry guns for an oil war
As-Salamu alaikum, wa alaikum assalam
Peace to the Middle East peace to Islam
Now don't get us wrong 'cause we love America
But that's no reason to get hysterica
They're layin' on the syrup thick
We ain't waffles we ain't havin' it
[Chorus]
Now how many people must get killed?
For oil families pockets to get filled?
How many oil families get killed?
Not a damn one so what's the deal?
It's time to lead the way and de-escalate
Lose the weapons of mass destruction and the hate
Say ooh ah what's the White House doin'?
Oh no! Say, what in tarnation have they got brewing?!
Well I'm not pro Bush and I'm not pro Saddam
We need these fools to remain calm
George Bush you're looking like Zoolander
Trying to play tough for the camera
What am I on crazy pills? We've got to stop it
Get your hand out my grandma's pocket
We need health care more than going to war
You think it's democracy they're fighting for?

Selling votes like E-pills at the discotheque
Environmental destruction and the national dept
But plenty of dollars left in the fat war chest

""One two three four""
""One two three four""
Oh Wine Cooler
Johnny Ryall is the bum on my stoop
I gave him fifty cents to buy some soup
He knows the time with the fresh Gucci watch
He's even more over than the mayor Ed Koch
Washing windows on the Bowery at a quarter to four
'Cause he ain't gonna' work on Maggie's farm no more
Livin' on borrowed time and borrowed money
Sleepin' on the street there ain't a damn thing funny
With the hand me down food and the hand me down clothes
A rockabilly past of which nobody knows
Makes his home all over the place
He goes to sleep by falling down on his face
Sometimes known as the leader of the homeless
Sometimes drunk and he's always phoneless
Sleepin' on the street in a cardboard box
Better off drinkin' than smokin' the rocks
Well..
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
Kickin' uptown Kickin' downtown Kickin' crosstown
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
He drinks where he lies He's covered with flies
He's got the hand me down Pumas and the tie dyes
Well You go upstate and get your head together
Thunderbird is the word and you're light as a feather
Detox at the flop house no booze allowed
Remember the good old days with the rockabilly crowd
Memphis is where he's from um in Tennessee
He lives in the street but he's no bum no
He's a rockabilly star from the days of old
He used to have teeth all filled with gold
He got a platinum voice but only gold records
On the bass was boots and on the drums was checkers
Luis Vuitton with the Gucci guitar Johnny Ryall
""Who do you think you are""
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
Takin' the night train Takin' the O.E.
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
""One two three four""
""One two three four""
""One two three four""
""One two three..""
Donald Trump and Donald Tramp living in the Men's Shelter
Wonder Bread bag shoes and singing Helter Skelter
He asks for a dollar you know what it's for
Man bottle after bottle he always needs more
He's no less important than you working class stiffs
He drinks a lot of liquor but he don't drink piss
He paid his dues playing the blues
He claims that he wrote the Blue Suede Shoes
Elvis shaved his head when he went into the army
""That's right y'all his name is""
Johnny - Kick it
Johnny Ryall Johnny Ryall
Johnny Ryall Johnny Rya..

Used over and over till they were tired and torn
Well like a broken clock that can't tell time
Ah like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes
Just like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
Ah like a band that planned and planned and planned
And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And snatched up the worm helpless to fight
And brought it back to the nest singing microphone check

You act like a diamond waiting to be set
In a gold ring as if I bet
As time goes by in this give and take
As long as I learn I will make mistakes
Now what do I want What do I need
Why do I want it What's in it for me
It's the imagery of technology

He had more cuts than my man Chuck Chillout
24 is my age and 22 is my gauge
I'm writing rhymes on a page I'm goin' off in a rage
Cause I'm out on a mission a stolen car mission
Had a small problem with the transmission
3 on the train in the middle of the night
I have this steak on my head cause I got into a fist fight
Life comes in phases take the good with the bad
You bought the coins on the street holmes... and you know you got had
Because it's all high spirit you know you gotta' hear it
Don't touch the mic baby don't come near it
It's gonna get you it's gonna get you
It's gonna get you girl it's gonna get you

You got your finger on the trigger like the Son of Sam I am
Like Clockwork Orange goin' off on the town
I've got homeboys bonanza to beat your ass down
Well I'm mad at my desk and I'd be writing all curse words
Expressing my aggressions through my schizophrenic verse words

A butterfly floats on the breeze of a sun lit day
As I feel this reality gently fade away
Riding on a thought to see where it's from
Gliding through a memory of a time yet to come
Smoke paints the air
Swirling images through my mind
Like a whirlpool spin beginning to unwind
And I stand at the edge cautiously awaiting
As time slips by
Carefully navigating by the stars in the sky
And I sit
And I think to myself
And on the horizon the sun light begins to climb
And it seems like it's been so long since he shined
But I'm sure it was only yesterday
A cold chill of fear cut through me
I felt my heart contract
To my mind I brought the image of light
And I expanded out of it
My fear was just a shadow
And then avoice spoke in my head
And she said dark is not the opposite of light
It's the absence of light
And I thought to myself
She knows what she's talking about
And for a moment I know
What it was all about.

Not walking around looking to get you cake
The D is for Diamonds not for Drakes
This not a fantasy and I'm not Mr. O'Rourke
The name's Mike D made in New York
Oh word?

think I'll make it, but I do hope that
they do not turn me down
I'm driving to the hill with auntie pat
and uncle bill and I hope I will get a
big huge role
I'm sittin here in polka dots
waitin for my little spot
where I will get one chance to shine
It happened after World War II
when people played a litte game
called soccer
St. Louis beat the English in an
unexpected shock and so they went
on to play Brazil but they lost
I waited for some three hours and
then I heard my name so I rushed
up to the front
They asked me a few questions like
what's your age and backround so I told
them everything that was true
I told them I liked ribbons and pink's my
favorite color and all they had to say was
this: Thank you for time we will call you in a
week or so, but only if you have done good
So I waited patiently for five days
and then I got a little mad but I
did not care that much
A few days later the phone rang
""Your in my movie"" said the guy.
""Yes I said, ""I love you lots I hope
you do the same to me""
So I went on and filmed the movie
and became very famous

About three bad brothers - you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, MCA and me Mike D.
Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl I ran into a guy
His name is MCA I said Howdy he said Hi
He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry he asked me for a sip
He said, Can I get some
I said, You can't get none
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said
Now my name is MCA I've got a license to kill yeah
I think you know what time it is it's time to get ill yeah
Now what do we have here an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand I make myself clear
We stepped into the wind he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin
Now I got the gun you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this I did it like that
I did it with a whiffleball bat
So I'm on the run the cop's got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for six hours then we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, Yippy Yo, you know this kid
I said, I didn't but I know he did
The kid said, Get ready cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money
Pulled out the jammy and aimed it at the sky
He yelled, Stick 'em up and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
I'm Mike D. and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect
MCA was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out the music stopped
His boy had beef and he got dropped
Mike D. grabbed the money MCA snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.

Something on the windowsill
Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Nowhere left to hide
Picture this now crystal clear
Nothing left to hold her here
And creeping up meanwhile
Traces of a smile

Caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
If I could fly
Open wide to see if I could fly
Something on the windowsill

Pay attention my intention is to bust a move what
I drink quarts and cans and bottles and sixes what up
Between the turntables keep the vodka and the mixes
Well I'm Mike D. I got the deuces wild yea that's right
A list of girlies numbers that I've dialed
I do the Smurf, the Popeye, and the Jerry Lewis
I like Bullwinkle but I don't like Moose
Well I'm schoolin' in the boys' room coolin' by the locker well
All the girls in class know that I'm the cool rocker agh yea
Punk in the hall man I should of ought to hit him
Had the fresh rhymes and the kid cold bite 'em
Smokin' in the boys room is what I do best
While you were at a party your girlfriend fessed
I keep a pistol in my pocket so you better be cautious
Fly around the world but it makes me nauseous
Mike D.'s day off everyday of the week ah D. keep it on
I got to the party and I did the freak
I got a girl in the Castle and one in the pagoda
You know I got rhymes like Abe Vigoda
I'm a Def Manhattan killer a rhyme driller
A mic in my hand (bust it) and a mouth full of Miller
I got a hat not a visor I drink Budweiser
The turntables up on the drum riser
The needle's in the groove and the vinyl's on the platter
I know that I'm fly man there's no need to flatter
I travel around the globe it's keeping girlies dizzy
My name's Mike D. now watch me get busy y'all
""g-g-get busy y'all""
""g-g-get busy y'all""
You're a fake wearin' sucker whose gold got rusted
Rusted rusted rusted rust..
Cheaper than a hot dog with no mustard
Mustard mustard mustard
You tried to steal my fresh and you got cold busted
Busted busted busted
Because your crew's all soft and I'm disgusted
Disgusted disgusted
I'm from downtown from the city of Manhattan
I got a lot of girlies and not one's cattin'
My posse's in effect and we're doin' the do
And we got more rhymes than your whole damn crew
Caught you poppin' that weak and you must of been dusted
Dusted dusted dusted
Stuck you head in the toilet and stone cold flushed it
Flushed it flushed it flushed it

So light a match to my ass 'cause I'm blowin' up
I'd like to thank the people for just showin' up

Put your point on the floor and just prove it
And I'm smurfin' not rehearsin' gettin' live y'all

You've got the boomin' system but it's sloshing out doo-doo
You think it's chocolate milk but it's watered down yoo-hoo
I've been through many times in which I thought I might lose it
The only thing that saved me has always been music
We've got our own studio the son of the G
It's no question life's been good to me
'Cause life ain't nothing but a good groove
A good mix tape to put you in the right mood
This one goes out to my man the Groove Merchant
Coming through with beats for which I've been searching
Like two sealed copies of expansions
I'm like Tom Vu with yachts and mansions
The logo I sport is the face of the monkey
Union made Ben Davis quality it's no junk see
My chrome is shining just like an icicle
I ride around town on my low-rider bicycle
Do you know but you're telling me to do it
""Booty"" ""booty"" ""booty""
""Ohh baby that's the way it is""
So many wack MC's you get the TV bozack
Ain't even gonna call out your names 'cause you're so wack
But one big oaf whose faker than plastic
A dictionary definition of the word spastic
You should have never started something that you couldn't finish
'Cause writin' rhymes to me is like Popeye to spinach
I'm bad ass move your fat ass 'cause you're wack son
Dancin' around like you think you're Janet Jackson
Thought you could walk on me to get some ground to walk on
I'll put the rug out under your ass as I talk on
I'll take you out like a sniper on a roof
Like an MC at the fever in the DJ booth
With your headphones strapped you're rockin' rewind pause
Tryin' to figure out what you can do to go for yours
But like the pencil to the paper I got more to come
One after another you can all get some
So you better take your time and meditate on your rhyme
'Cause your shit'll be stinkin' when I go for mine
And that's right y'all don't get uptight y'all
You can't say shit because you're biting what I write y'all
And that's wrong y'all over the long haul
You can't cut the mustard when you're fronting it all

Now this song is dedicated,
To all the hard workin' pioneers of this country
Setting out discovering the West
Bringin' a railroad to where no man has ever been before.
Johnny he worked on a railroad
A poundin' on iron and steel
Workin' his way out West now
The only sure things his next meal
America was young
But she was a growin'
Layin' tracks across the prairie
Not knowing where they're going
His mother didn't wanna' leave him
But now he's in the West
She said please don't go
But he said if I don't I'll never rest
It wasn't always easy
Some of the boys died
Johnny wrote her letters
But received no replies
Johnny he worked on a railroad
A poundin' on iron and steel
Workin' his way out West now
The only sure things his next meal
Johhny reached San Francisco
Tired and broke without a dime
Started panning for gold
Just a hopin' he would find
The gold wasn't a rushin'
But Johnny kept on minin'
Trying to send his mama something
With the letters he was signing
Then one day Johnny finally got a reply
When he opened mama's letter
He began to cry
She's a writin' from her deathbed
And this is what she said
Please don't be mad at me son,
'Ccause tomorrow I'll be dead
Johnny he worked on a railroad
A poundin' on iron and steel
Workin' his way out West now
The only sure things his next meal

Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control

People mislead by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction

Like a rainy day's Earth it won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life it seems to stall
But never be ungrateful y'all
So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King I've got the crazy hair do
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote control

Only a few hundred years since Columbus landed

As the windows who knows show the knowledge with us
'Cause it's the one that we prayed for, from on the earth
I give the wisdom to folks, you know whole worth
In these great times we still neglect
When they invent this land, don't give the due respect
'Cause the FBI and the CIA
The whole federal government, the FDA

We come a long way with the peace in the East
But on the home front, they're wild in the streets
As it gets got hear a changing in same
And this is the Millennium still felt today
I hear the same stories time after time
The stories of fear, through violent crimes
Committed by hatred by satient beings
Who shall loose by kindness and it's plain to see
Now we don't have to stand for this oppression any longer
If we stand together, there's nothing stronger
We must interconnect it as though we sure have won
If we want to avoid planetary destruction

Has assumed the truth and I know I'll find
And I visualize resolution
See it all as a state of constant evolution

The world leaders were terrified of loosing their pride
Their spoiled children tellin' little wack lies
Vanishing numbers of unimaginable destruction
Sure as we boast they're at their last production
Threatening and challenging nature against nation
Walkin' down the road of total annihilation
Sprouting threats is insecure
Guns are for the fighting and they're immature
And it all stems from self-important police
Thinking that we're better than our fellow human beings
So I wanna empower the limit I can
And pass it along so we can do pass the pan
Some times I sit and I watch my mind
Watchin' my thoughts as they reel and wind
And stop and visualize resolution
For everyday is in a state of evolution
Evolution time

Bringin' the beat back and keepin' it lastin'
Keepin' it top notch, beyond passing
Simmer in the pan 'cause, I ain't flashin'
I'm party crashin' so you better batten
Down those hatches stop procrastin-
Well I'm Mike D with a story to tell
And when I rock the crowd the crowd we all yell
And when I get the feeling I feel the feel swell
'Cause when I start to rhyme well I rhyme the rhyme well
Went to the top and never went pop and
Came back down but still not stopping
I'm not even asking, ""Yo what's cracking?""
Serving MC's on a platter like baked Alaskan
So start packing because I'm back in
The game of hiphop reprenting Manhattan
Now push the pause button then start ducking
Shhhhh you heard me like I'm E.F. Hutton,
Hutton shhhhhhhh, Hutton shhh, Hutton shhhhhhh,
Hutton SHHHHHHHHH!!!!

MC's be really workin' on what they write
With the sound delight we rock all night
And yes we're gonna party for the right to fight
We're international like Matt Takei
Rock the mic from Munich out to Taipei
Still around the way is where we'll stay
Say what we mean, mean what we say
Trajectories from the past are taking their toll and
What we do now is future moulding
Columbine bowling, childhood stolen
We need a bit more gun controlling
Right, Right, Now, Now
What is goin' on?
We, We, Gotta, Gotta
Get it goin' on
Be, Be, Fore, Fore
It's Too Far Gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long
When I get on you scream ""Hoo Tight!""
Rockin' this flow I could go all night
I'm not here to fight, or incite
I'm like the beach in the Bahamas make you feel alright
I'm getting kind of tired of the situation
The US attacking other nations
And narration, on every station
False election's got me losing my patience
I'm a funky-ass Jew and I'm on my way
And yes I got to say fuck the KKK
And oh yeah hey, how about today?
If you want to set it off then let me hear you say
Right, Right, Now, Now
What is goin' on?
We, We, Gotta, Gotta
Get it goin' on
Be, Be, Fore, Fore
It's Too Far Gone
We gotta work together, it's been too long
I went to get a loan and they asked my race
I wrote down human inside the space
It's a disgrace how they try to debase
It ain't the bank's damn business how my lineage trace
Now let me drop a verse that's terse and concise
I'm an iron chef when I slice and dice
With the rhyme precise, the word is nice
So please pass me the Reunite on ice
Well let's go to work and not beserk
'Cause when the time comes the body goes to dirt
Try to smooth it out like Levert
Keep the mind alert and not revert
Right, Right, Now, Now
What is goin' on?

Get it goin' on
Be, Be, Fore, Fore
It's Too Far Gone

We're the b-boys, we don't regret
There's nothing wrong with your TV set
We're a gettin loose
We couldn't be harder
Our beats are bigger and better and longer
Got real rock shit
You must admit
Not fake, not false, not counterfit
I can play the drums, I can play gituar
Not just b-boys, but real rock stars
Rock, rock rock...
When we borrow your shit, you better hit the deck
You'll walk the plank for your dis
Respect, respect, respect...
If you front on the Rock, best run and hide
If you got static, we'll take it outside
And you start to get dulled by the Beastie Boys
Use real rock beats, show off big toys
Like claps of thunder from the cumulus clouds
So we'll pump up the beat and make it real loud
Loud...
A, then scrach it...
Heavy metal tension running through your blood
Too much rock step off the pud
Too much treble mid-range and bass
The beat's so hard it'll dick your face
You'll crush out hard rock hard beats hard
Rock cold rythms for fanitic freaks
Some people say this has been done
We're hear we're now
And the battles won
Fists...
Fists of fury in an MC bout
Rock so hard it'll knock you out
The very first blow is a kick in the snout
The beat's so def that you better beware
When you're talkin' bass right in your face
The walls crumble down, destroying the place
The finishing touch is the bokasat-slam
The final blow in the five finger jam
Some...
Sometimes I write rythms rather write rhymes
He writes his and I write mine
Rock 'n roll rythms are raunchy and ronkis
We're from Manhatten, you're from Secaucus
Mike D AdRock and MCA
Not before long I can hear you say
In a way these boys got juice
They're goin' off you know they love to get loose
Get loose get loose...
Poose
Gettin' the Ad Ad AdRock
MCA Mike D. in the place to be
The Beastie Boys showin' up in toy
That's right
Uh, Uh
In the place to be
You know it, you know it
AdRock, uh uh
When the party gets loose
Slop one, slop one
And your goin' the boots
Everybody gettin' trouble
LOV on the New York C.
Double R double R
Better off the by
Just takin' off the jile
Like I lost my style
Gonna' grab my rhyme
All the nigros the got style

Your style to my style you can't hold a candle to it
Equinox symmetry and the balance is right
Smokin' and drinkin' on a Tuesday night
Not how you play the game but it's
how you win it
I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic
For those about to rock we salute you
The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to
I once was lost but now I'm found
The music washes over and you're one with the sound
Well who shall inherit the earth the meek shall
And yo I think I'm starting to peak now Al

Music for all for not just one people
And now we're gonna bust with the Putney Swope sequel
More Adidas sneakers that a plumber got pliers
Got more suites that Jacoby & Meyers well..
If not for my vices and my bugged out desires
My year would be good just like Goodyear's tires
Cause I'm out pickin' pockets at the Atlantic Antic
And nobody wants to hear you cause your rhymes are so frantic
I mix business and pleasure way too much

I've Got the girlies in the Couple like the Colonel's got the chickens
And I always go out dapper like Harry S. Truman

My noggin is hoggin all kinds of thoughts
And Adam Yoggin is Yauch and he's rockin of course
Well smoke the holy chalice got my own religion
Rally round the stage and check the funky dope musicians
Just like Jerry Lee Swaggert or Jerry Lee Falwell
You love Mario Andretti cause he always drives his car well
Vicious circle of reality since the day you were born
And we love the hot butter ""say what"" the popcorn
Sippin on wine and mackin
Rockin' on the stage with all the hands clappin' Yea...
Ride the wave of fate it don't ride me holmes
""Being very proud to be an M.C.""
And then the man upstairs well I hope that he cares

In the back of the ride and bust with the whippet

Running from the law the press and the parents
""Is your name Michael Diamond?""

But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right but I didn't wanna' know
The girlie was Def and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy but they all call her Loose
I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce
The next think she said, My place or yours?
Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!
We got into the cab the cab driver said
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it
Something's going on and I'll probably never get it
She was crying like a baby stupid dumb
It's just too bad that girl's a bum
She's crafty she gets around
She's crafty she's always down
She's crafty she's got a gripe
She's crafty and she's just my type
She's crafty
I spent my last dollar to by a Sabrett
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile
And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me she said she loved the show
I asked her to come home and she couldn't say No
We got to the crib and there was Adam and D.
We didn't say a word they just stared at me
I said, I don't know her I just met her tonight
And Adrock started hiding everything in sight
D. pulled me over said hide your gold,
The girl is crafty like ice is cold
The girl is crafty she knows all the moves
I started playing records she knew all the grooves
He thought she was a thief and D. was right
But I just figured she'd spend the night
When I woke up late in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself sleeping in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
The mirror the TV the new guitar cord
My remote control and my old skateboard
She robbed us blind she took all we owned
And the boys blamed me for bringing her home

She wants to waste my time and that's no delusion
Her final decision is perfection and precision
She's grade A class number one in her division
'Cause she's on it
And she's on it
She acts like a nag I don't know how it started
Even when I'm chillin' she acts retarded
It's gets annoying so high on the tip
If a pirate had a Def Jam shirt she'd be hard on his ship
'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it
Cold chillin' in the spot and she won't stop
She'll do what's best just to reach the top
She studies real hard all night she'll cram
In school she majors in advanced Def Jam
'Cause she's on it
And she's on it
'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it
'Cuase she's on it
She's cold in the winter and cool like ice
Sometimes she gets loose sometimes she gets nice
Hear heart starts beatin' her hands get clammy
'Cause she used to be stucked up now she's on my jammy
'Cause she's on it
And she's on it
Her bedroom eyes they start to twitch
But she won't front 'cause she's got that itch
She'd drop to her knees if I'd only say please
Instead of counting sheep cold counting Beasties
'Cause she's on it
'Cause she's on it
And she's on it

Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
It's never old school all brand new
So everybody catch the bugaloo flu
Not like a fever not like a cold
But the beats are clear the rhymes are bold
So don't see a doctor or see a nurse
Just listen to the music first things first
First of all get off the wall
It's time to party so have a ball
We slowed it on down so get the hell up
Like a volcano I'll erupt
We got determination bass and highs
White Castle fries only come in one size
What you see is what you get
And you ain't seen nothing yet
So let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
I do not sing but I make a Def song
You could live your whole life - and I hope you live long
On the Gong Show we won't get gonged
We're the Beastie Boys not Cheech and Chong
Strong as an ox fresh out the box
The crowd is so live they're coming in flocks
And when we go on the crowd goes off
It's all hard rock there's nothing soft
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
COD
So Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
And Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
We don't only rock the house but we'll house we rock
We don't stroll but we roll straight to the top
MCA Adrock Mike D. makes three
And we can do it like this in the place to be
When I'm recorded you'll be rewarded
I know my song is Def 'cause you all applauded
Not PCP or LSD just me Mike D. in the place to be
This is not free you must pay a fee
Cash on delivery like a COD
So Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
The beat is slow in order to dance
I wanna' hear I do's and no I can't
First you move your legs and then your arms
It's not fast and nervous this dance is calm
It's truly stable and you ought to be able
To dance to the record when it's on the turntable
So Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo
Let it flow let yourself go
Slow and low that is the tempo

I got the jammy with the ammo inside my sock
I shot homeboy but the bullet was a dud
So I reached in the Miller cooler grabbed a cool Bud
Slow riding gun hidin' on the go
I'm fly like an eagle and I drink Old Crow
I'm the king of the classroom coolin' in the back
My teacher had beef so I gave her a smack
She chased me out of class 0 she was strapped with a ruler
Went to the bathroom rolled myself a wooler
With bottle in hand at the microphone stand
Ay yo homeboy what you drinkin' man
I got money I got juice
I got to the party and I got loose
I got rhythms I got rhymes
I got the girlies with the Def behinds
I got ill I got busted
I got dust and I got dusted
I got gold I got funky
I got the new dance they call the Brass Monkey
Because I'm hard hittin' always biten cool as hell
I got the trees on my mirror so my car won't smell
Sittin' around the house gettin' high and watchin' tube
I'm eating Colonel's chicken drinkin' Heineken brew
And I'm a gangster I'm a prankster I'm the king of the Ave.

Rock well to tell dispel all of the old fables

Riding between the cars pissing smoking
Also finger popping
Two bums fucking I seen them rocking
Head for the last car fluorescent light blackout
Policeman told my homeboy put that crack out
You know you light up when the lights go down
Read the New York Post Fulton St. downtown
Same faces every day but you don't know their names
Party people going placed on the D-Train
French trench coat wing tip going to work
Pulling a train like Captain Kirk
Pick pocket gangsters paying their debts
Caught a bullet in the lung from Bernie Goetz
Overworked and underpaid staring at the floor
Prostitutes spandex caught in the ding dong doors
Stuck between the stations it seems like an eternity
Sweating like sardines in a flophouse fraternity
$50.00 fine for disturbing the peace
The neck tortoise the Lees creased
Hot cup of coffee and the donuts are Dunkin
Friday night and Jamaica Queens funkin
Elevated platform never gonna conform
Riding over the diner where I always get my toast warm
Bust into the conductor's booth and busted out rhymes
Over the loud speaker about the hard times
Sat across from a man readin El Diario
Riding the train down from El Barrio
Went from the station straight to Orange Julius
Bought a hot dog from my man George Drakoulias

50 cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
Can't rock the house without the party people
'Cause when we're gettin' down we are all equal
There's no better or worse between you and me
But I rock the mic so viciously
Ah Like pins and needles and words that sting
At the blink of an eye I will do my thing
It's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
Ah Like diggin' down deep in the record bins
Well everybody gettin' down make no mistake
Nothing sounds quite like an 8 0 8

You can kiss my ass you funky boss
Now that you got what you want, you want more
Well I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door
Well with these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'
Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel somethin'
'Cause I can give you all you need
A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read
Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit

You want peace for the people then ya say alright
'Cause George W's got nothing on me
We got to take the power from he
When I'm on the mic I feel good to go
Like a snow day for school with hot cocoa
So don't speak what I heard, just say what I know
And my zodiac sign is Scorpio
Look what the cat dragged in
The creme de la creme without the skin
So take a rest and mind your own biz
And that's it that's all that's all there is
Fresh... fresh... fresh... for you... for you... for you
That's fresh... fresh... fresh... for you... for you... for you
One for Brooklyn, two for Manhattan
Let's go to work, get those hands clappin'
Make you bounce, rock, roll and skate
Don't underrate how I operate
It ain't what you say, it's what you mean
Intention leads to action, that is my theme
So pay attention now as I begin to recap
Puttin' words and ideas stacked back to back
Some rhymes go flat, well mine go fizz
I got no time for the drama 'cause stress is for kids
'Cause when you're dead and buried well you got no biz
And that's it that's all that's all there is
Fresh... fresh... fresh... for you... for you... for you
That's fresh... fresh... fresh... for you... for you... for you
Brand new
The time and place for the mind is here and now
Keep the mind present less to worry about
But like the hammer to the nail hit the nail on the head
Well I don't shoot blanks and I don't shoot lead
Well I'm a freaky streaker like Winnie the Pooh
T-shirt and no pants and I dance the bugaloo
Like George Whipple on New York One
Got a hairy ass and that's no fun
I'm in the rhyme zone a different time zone
And on the microphone you know that I'm at home
It's time we looked past all our differences
An' that's it that's all that's all there is
Come on
Fresh... fresh... fresh... for you... for you... for you
That's fresh... fresh... fresh... for you... for you... for you

So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
Who be rockin y'all in stere-ereo
in stere-ereo in stere-ereo in stereo

A No time like the present to work shit out
That's what we're going on and on and on about
I'm not fakin' just makin' beats in the dungeon
Keep that shit funky 'cause the odor is pungent
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hands the task

Center stage on the mic
And we're puttin' it on wax
It's the new style
Four and three and two and one (What up!)
And when I'm on the mic - the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Adrock and Mike D. and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick
B-E-A-S-T-I-E, what up Mike D.
Ah yeah, that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it - I got it, I know it's good
The rhymes I write - you wish you would I'm never in training - my voice is not straining
People always biting and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Bust into your locker and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secausus - I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'
(bridge) There it is - kick it!!!
Father to many - married to none
And in case you're unaware I carry a gun
Stepped into the party - the place was over packed
Saw the kid that dissed my homey and shot him in the back
I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank - I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice - twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlie's I like are underage (Check it!)
Girls with boyfriends are the kind I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
Your father - he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green
I've got the girlie's numbers from the places I been
(repeat bridge)
You wanna know why - because I'm
October 31st - that is my date of birth
I got to the party and I did the Smurf
Taxing all females from coast to coast
And when I get my fill I'm chilly most
We rag-tag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fat Burger when I way out west
K-I-N-G-A-D whammy
All the fly ladies are on my jammy
Went to the prom - wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
Met this girl at the party and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes and she pulled up her skirt
Spent some bank - I got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly and I watched Colombo
Let me clear my throat - Kick it over here baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies, feel the beat...drop
Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer day
Just me, my posse and M.C.A.
A lot of beer - a lot of girls - and a lot of cursing
Twenty-two automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big - and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble - some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face
Like the bun to the burger - like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry to the apple - to the peach to the plum
I'm the king of the Ave. - and I'm the king of the block
I'm M.C.A. - and I'm the King Adrock
I'm Mike D. - I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the forty deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads

I Do My Best To Figure It Out And Work It Out In The Long
I Try To Do A Lot More Than I Can Chew
Balance Out My Ambition's What I've Got To Do
Because You Hide In Broad Day Light, A Parasite
A Hypocrite, You Take A Peek Quick
You Turn Your Nose Up, You Think You're High Up
You Play It Real Safe And Now Your Shit's Fake
I Seen You Hawking And Then You Clock My Style
And Then You Try To Play It Off Like You Think You're Wild
D.I.Y. That Means Do It Yourself
Don't Sit Around Waiting For Someone's Help
Don't Sit Back And Say Good Enough
Keep On Striving, Reinventing But Keeping It Off
The Cuff
So Kick The Level Up Cuhootnified
Mackadocius Vibes Positively Fortified
I'm Throwing Rhymes Kicking Them Downtown
Traveling High Speed Through The Underground
I Kick It Free Style, Make It Worth Your While
I've Got Shelves Of Rhymes That I Keep On File
I'm Feeling Good Now Back Home Again
New York City Is The City That I Feel At Home In
A Blast From The Grasshoff Awhile It's Been
Stepping Into The Future Again
I'm Straight From The 88 To 93 To 94, I'm Out The Door
Step Into The Party With The Fila Fresh Gear
People Looking At Me Like I Was David Koresh Here
Kicking Rhymes From The Heart 'Cause That's Where I'm At
Fuck The Bullshit, Be It Far From Me To Pop That
In The Search For Truth, I Go A Lot Of Ways
There's Not A Lot Of Peace, That I Find These Days
I Try To Stay Cool, I Try To Stay Calm
But My Life Is Getting Hectic Like A Smoke Bomb
So I'll Say It Like The Group Huggy Bear
There's A Boy-Grrrl Revolution Of Wich You Should Be Aware
You Can't Dis Me, It Ain't Worth It, B
You Put Yourself Down And You Don't Even See
Cause I Don't Play That, I Know Who I Am
For A Minute, I Did But Now I'm Back Again
I'm Feeling Strong See, Trust Myself G
Well I Stopped Smoking Cheeba
And That Was Part Of The Key
We've Got Fire, We Need Water, So I Guess I Ought To
Leave You Broke In A Comatose State Of Mind
And I'm Blind And I'm Working Overtime, So Check It
I Keep My Rhymes In A Little Black Book
And I Know You Want To Take Another Look

Look Around And Listen And You'll See Every Sign
The Waters Are Polluted As The Forests Are Cut Down
Bombing And Drilling Deep Below Ground
Check The Prophecies From Around The World
And Look Around Now As It All Unfurls
Look Into Yourself And See What Goes On
Get A Feeling In Your Heart Of The Right From Wrong
Because The Mother Earth Needs To Be Respected
Been Far From Too Long That She's Been Neglected
Race Against Race, Such A Foolish Waste
It's Like Cutting Off Your Nose To Spit Your Face
And At The End Of The Wars, What Was The Cost
It's Clear That The Earth Was The One Who Lost
We Are One With Her As She Is One With Us
It's Unreal How She Is Treated So Unjust
As Our Planet Grows Smaller Each And Every Day
Everyone Affecting Everyone In Every Way
We're All Citizens Of The Worl Community
All Here Together And We're Searching For Unity
Over The Years, I've Grown And Changed So Much
Things I Know Now Years Ago, I Couldn't Touch
There Are Things I've Done That I Wouldn't Do Again
But I'm Glad That I Did 'Cause I've Learned From Them
I Just Try To Stay Present Right Here, Right Now
No Worries, No Fears And Without Any Doubts
It's About Time
'Cause In These Times, These Changing Times
A Transition Is Occuring And I Am Not Blind
As The Pendlum Swings A New Age We Enter
And With Every Swing, It Draws Closer To The Center
Yes The Storm Before The Calm And The Wars That Lead To Love
Things Must Run Their Course So We Push And We Shove
But We're Here To Work It Out In One Way Or Another
To Find A Mutual Respect For Ourselves And One Another
And The True Key Is A Trust In Self
For When I Trust Myself, I Fear No One Else
I Took Control Of My Life, Just As Anyone Can
I Want Everyone To See It's In The Palm Of Your Hand
The Past Is Gone, The Future Yet Unborn
But Right Here And Now Is Where It All Goes On
I Know We Can Fix It And It's Not Too Late
I Give Respect To King And His Nonviolent Ways
I Dream And I Hope And I Won't Forget
Someday I'm Going To Visit On A Free Tibet
Someday I'm Going To See Us All Joined As One
And It Would Be Too Bad To Blow It Up Before We're Done
'Cause We Long Behind The Rage Learning From The Pain
The Love Behind The Tension Like The Sun Behind The Rain
I'm Sending Loving Light To All That Is
To All Creation And The Life We Live
I'm Not Preaching Bull Shit, Just Speaking My Mind
'Cause I'm Here Now And It's About Time

You've got the elephant feet like Les McCan
Up the crack of dawn I'm on my way
We're talking two foot dump and there'll be no delay
'Cause I'm gone, the shit's getting out of hand
I'm changing my middle name to first Trem
Because I'm walking on the rhythm like Philippe Petite
I've got holes in my mouth where my teeth should be
You ask whatever happenened to the rappin' duke
I heard the Captain's gonna sign him to Jive and that's the truth
Taking care of my functions still smokin, up the shrubery
I stopped eating chicken 'cause the shit was too rubbery
My produce, organic, it's from my own yard
Only the freshest herbs and growing's not too hard
Vibes, vibrations
Vibes, vibrations
Dreaming on it, screaming on it, ready to get dumb
Waxing up my long joint, ready to get some
Looking at my board and my old boots
Seeing a waist deep champagne moment of truth
And on the court I've got game like my brother Matt
I give a shout out so where you at
But don't get souped Mathew 'cause I'm a take ya
Horatio Park right now and I'm a shake ya
Give me the fresh count you know that I'm stressed out
I need some inspiration so get the best out
Like Rock Master Scott, I'm on the request line
Writing the fresh rhyme, having the best time
Good vibes flowing all around
Not a worry in mind as the friends around
A shout out to Linda riding pow forever
Well the ""Bird is the word and you're as light as a feather""
Vibes, vibrations
Vibes, vibrations
And Then I smoke a bag of rat weed 'cause I don't care
And I'm waxing old ladies out their underwears
I like the boomin' grannies in big old panties
I'm ""giving, it to grandma making her crazy""
Well I might be a white boy but I'm no goofy
Got beats like Bobalou on ""I Love Lucy""
I'm not like the Skipper on ""Fantasy Island""
I'm more like Captain Shtupping when I go ""back whylin'""
The Cire Traverse out to the Death shoot
Or S.T.H. when they let me back at the Deuce
'Cause I ""can't get enough"" of that funky stuff
When the going gets rough ain't going out in the sluff
Down with Bubble Gum and Ninth Creation
You Get on down we've got the sound sensation
Kid Fresh is back from the 80's
And we're doing it for the ladies
Vibes, vibrations
Vibes, vibrations
We got Vibes, vibrations
We got Vibes, vibrations

I'm not the type of person who likes to waste my time
And when I'm on the mic I just say my rhymes
And I'm out on bail the check is in the mail
They can sentence me to life but I won't go to jail
I'm cool calm collected from class I was ejected
Just me, Mike D and MCA we're rarely disrespected
I got all the time that I need to kill
What's that time It's time to get ill

Fully captivated by that funky ass bass
Your girlfriend screams when MCA's in the place
He stumbles in the room with the Chivas in his hand
Cold chillin' on the spot at the microphone stand
I'd have the pedal to the metal if I had a car
But I'm chiller with the Miller cold coolin' at the bar
I can drink a quart of Monkey and still stand still

I spent my last dime to refill my fat belly

""I'm Mr. Ed""
"" The famous Mr. Ed""
Riding down the block... Uh-huh...
Riding down the block with my box in my hand
Today I feel like chillin' just as chill as I can
Coolin' on the corner with a forty of O.E.
'Cause me and MCA we're down with Mike D.
When I run a jam I don't give a damn
When I'm throwing bass I say Thank you ma'am
Fuel injected, rhyme connected running things
Well I'm the King Adrock and I'm the king of all kings
I'm looking for a spot things are gettin' hot
I'm MCA I'm here to stay and you sir, you are not
Oh no, it could not be it's such a sight to see
It's such a trip you're on my tip so listen to Mike D.
My work is my play cause I'm playing when I work
My name's Mike D as you can see and I can dot the jerk

Ignorance or pass the blame

the A is for Adam and the lyrics; true
so as pray and hope and the message is sent
and I AM living in the dreams that I have dreamt
because I'm down with the three the unstoppable three
me and Adam and D. were born to M.C.
and my body and soul and mind are pure
not polluted or diluted or damaged beyond cure
just lyrics from I to you recited
arrested, bailed but cuffed and indicted
enter the arena as I take center stage
the lights set low and the night has come of age
take the microphone in hand as that I am a professional
speak my knowledge to the crowd and the ed. is special
for I AM a bard but not the last one
I'm my own king and this is my castle
dwell in realms of now but vidi those of the past
seen a glimpse from ahead and I don't think it's gonna last

I drop the L. when I'm skiing
I'm smoking and peaking
I put the skis on the roof almost every single weekend
can't stop the mindfuck when it's rolling along
can't stop the smooth runnin's when the shit's running strong
broke my bindings the lion with wings
preaching his word in the B. Boy sing
I AM one with myself as I turn to The
I prefer the dreams to reality
I prefer my life don't need no other man's wife
don't need no crazy lifestyle with stress and strife
but it's good to have turn to be a king for a day
or for a week or for a year or for a year in a day
come what may
I'm fishing with my boat and I'm fishing for trout
mix the Bass Ale with the Guiness Stout
fishing for a line inside my brain
and looking out at the world through my window pane
every day has many colors cuz the glass is stained
everything has changed but remains the same
so once again the mirror raised and I see myself as clear as day
and I AM going to the limits of my ultimate destiny
feeling as though Somebody were testing me
He who sees the end from the beginning of time
looking forward through all the ages is, was and always shall be
check the prophetic sections of the pages
He goes by the name of Disco Dave

Years and years you try to keep her a secret
Said she's your cousin that came for a visit
Your puttin' me on, is this true, now who is it
Called your crib, got a clickin dial tone
You said it was the maid that hung up the phone
Caught her on the streets, so we took the risk
Guess what, we found out she was your sis
Now we're not Tom, Dick, Harry, or Roy
Let us crack the freak, because we're your boys
Tonight we're dropin by cause your parents left
The Beastie Boy gonna' let you know
Your sister's def
Your sister's def
She's so hook, is she, how can it be
Don't lie, she's not in your family
Cause if you didn't know, people spread the word
Your a square sucker whipped, yes your a nerd
To be down, there's one thing you'll discover
Your sister must be a plash Beastie lover
So don't get sick, she was our pick
I hope her tongue is long, we like to be licked
You'll see it's not hard, it's naughty nice
You gotta pay us dues, and she's the price
Don't start to think about the worlds discuss
Your sisters gotta hang, and that's a must
It's plain and simple, it ain't no thing
She's real def, let us give her a ring
So we conclude, this is your best move
Welcome, the Beastie Boys approve
Your sister's def
This week we all will meet
Right now the party season will reach its peek
Juice all around town, we're on the guest lists
We'll bring three tricks, you bring your sis
Pay attention real close, we just begun
Trick number one is to grab her buns
We'll loose control, but we'll keep it clean
She better not wear a dress, wear the blue jeans
New or faded, we want 'em tight
Take the pockets off so we can grip it right
Stand in front, we wanna see what we like
If the room's too dark, you bring a flashlight
Two is do the do, for the whole crew
A dead give away cause we're givin her clues
She better be ready to play the wall
Cause it's all for one, and one for all
No matter who's first, lets start the show
There are no rules, go for what you know
We won't slack up, won't let her rest
Our pride is on the line, to see who's best
Now that you've heard thoughts quite absurd
Convince your sis, put in a good word
Your sister's def
At last a neurotic feast
We're slaying your sister like a horny beast
So don't get mad, don't be upset
It's now her time to be a Beastie pet
As you can see most definitely
Is trick number three, pure fantasy
Now we're your friend, and your her brother
But your sisters so def we might scheme on your mother
We can't ignore now that we saw
She's def so we wanna be your in-law
We're havin fun, yo we ain't done
The Beastie Boys has just begun
Because your sister's def
Your sister's def
Took a walk around the crack of dawn
I noticed her bedroom light was on
Her shadow moved over as the lights went lower
I crept to the window to see a little closer
Said to myself, I got it made
The window was open, so was the shade
Came in real neat, she was in heat
Your sister gave a class A peach-o treat
Her clothes got thinner, I showed her my winner
Beastie beef is now served for dinner
Your sister's def
Later on I came around the way
But sis MCA said he got some play
There had to be a reason for the news I learned
Time to get on it cause it's Mike D.'s turn
Nobody was home, I didn't see the car
She took me downstairs and we crashed the bar
We was chillin in the basement, drinkin' Red Wipple
After a while my head between pink nipples
Grabbin at your sis cause I can't resist
I start to dive, pummel her rumble fish
When I got through, next thing she knew
On her thighs was a beastie tattoo
Your sister's def
That's it, AdRock is pissed
If you leave me in the room with your sister, I'm takin her clit
You can bet if she gets wet
The King AdRock will make her sweat
I throw her down, then take her underwear
Then search 'em so I can eat the pubic hairs
Even in her dream scene, she starts to scream
It's the AdRock inches, and you know what I mean
We had her in the week, your sisters cheap
The Beastie Boys just made a clean sweep

If you don't repeat the actions of your own success
you won't be successful
You gotta know your own formula, your own ingredients
What made you, YOU..
1987 I was at the Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughter
He said, ""Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!""
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
there was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was ""Stop the Violence""
and unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin, ""Huh, what about him?""
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
but his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
but with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
""You like it cause you choose it""
1991, we opened our eyes
with Human Education Against Lies, we tried
to talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me ""Captain Human"", another message was sent
""Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent""
Remember that?  Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at?  All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, ""Yo Kris, what you wanna do?""
I said, ""Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory.
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe.
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?""
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
""Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry""
Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, ""Return of the Boom Bap""
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
""Step Into a World,"" that's what I did
1997 I was raisin my kid
or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
to clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
and took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz
they so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but
big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
""Yo you need help?  I should call them""
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride
with the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G, that was the crew
Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, ""Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters.
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya.""
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!..
{interviewer}
Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live.
{KRS} Yes!
{interviewer}
Explain that to us please.
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not,
just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
to view the world.  So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP,
is something we live.  And we look at hip-hop, in it's 9 elements;
which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing,
street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
entrepenurialism - trade and business.  And uhh, that's where y'know
that's the hip-hop that that that we're about.  We come from the uhh
the root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
and then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
and added conciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash
with the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself.
And uhh, we created the ""Stop the Violence"" movement, you may recall
a song, ""Self Destruction"" and and and so on.  All of this, goes to
uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
for how it looks and and acts in society.

If you want a woman to treat you right
[KRS talking through Chorus]
That's right, that's right
I think y'all need to listen to this, stop what'cha doin
[Verse One]
Women will treat you right
But you can't be one of them lookin a freak you lookin a beat you type
You gotta seek the light in the dark
I used to free this mic in the park
Now I speak direct to your heart
Women want men to show respect for they art
Women don't be checkin for the chart
They go straight to sister to sister and pick it apart
Begin with the heart, our sisters is a living art
Always givin, always deliverin, always making something bigger from just a little part
Big up to the sisters that start up businesses
With nothing but muffins, still liftin kids
Strong women ,work long women
Not them dump-ass dizzy stupid thong women
King-Kong women, bring it all women, independent women with thoughts & opinions
Women like G.Simone, See, I maybe the Pharaoh
But believe she is the crown Let me leave it alone
Cause a lot of ya still wanna rome, they got houses but still want home
Sittin on chrome but forever alone
Cause intelligent courageous women they were never shown
They say they don't love them hoes
But Jesus allowed hoes to wash in all his toes
I don't mean to impose, but if you want a woman to treat you right
I don't think you need to start with the clothes
I think you need to start with what she knows
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
That's what you got to know from the start
Whats in the heart & the mind
Without that you startin out blind
You're going into a direction of what a trap ???? behind
Its like you sittin in a cell with the doors opened
and you decide to sit and do the time
Free your mind, don't pattern your life after some freestyle rhyme
See me, I'm...

C'mon, gather round now, gather round now, look now
How many times did you pre-meditate
what you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait
You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind
But in the end, everything came in time
But before the time, you was losin your mind
You was racin and rushin and fallin behind
But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
to the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout
[Chorus]
Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust
C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look
[KRS-One]
After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what?  Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin and begin to, live it up
Everytime you think it's one way it's not
Everytime you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma
[Chorus]
{*singers*}
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
[KRS-One]
Uh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look
So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Everytime you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on

We are the ones prophesized to return
My main concern is for all of you to learn
How to live, yes through the lyrics I give and send my friend
This age is coming to an end
Not the world, but the age is ending
Ending, listen to the astrological message I'm sending
I'm sending, tell em
Truth is truth, whether or not you like me
We are living now in the age of Pisces
When Pisces is over, at the year two thousand
When the Sun of God, changes his house and
enters the Age of Aquarius
The Sun of God as man is hilarious (okay)
When you think of Jesus, think of the Sun
The flaming Sun, that's where they stole this concept from
Stop believing and read your bible logically
The new testament is really old astrology
Jesus is the son of God no lie
But they might be talking about the Sun up in the sky
The Sun, that hangs on the cross of the zodiac
The zodiac with twelve signs to be exact
Each sign is a house, and you should keep in mind
Each house equals, a period of time
The time, two thousand years and that's a fact
It's called an age or a house in the zodiac
The twelve disciples, are twelve months of reason
The four gospels signify the four seasons
When Jesus fed the multitude with two fishes
It signified the Age of Pisces, not fish or dishes
If you read the bible astrologically it's clearer (no doubt)
The next age will be the age of the water-bearer
It's called the Age of Aquarius (word)
When logic and truth will take care of us
So in this age, of spiritual dignity
You'll see a rise in femininity
and creativity, meshed with masculinity
You got to get with me, this is your true her-story (rrryyy!)
Do you wanna go higher...

Well it deserves to get beaten and robbed by black
Give me my frame of mind back
Give me my culture
But you dont understand that cause you a sucker
Chorus
I see Beauval in the house, Collinet in the house
Sarcelles in the house, Cercle Rouge in the house
KRS-One rocks the mike without a doubt
Turning parties out
You know what I am about
Cause we will be here forever I told you
Soldier floods your mind like Noah
As you get older you've got to pay attention
At how you livin hardcore
You aint a kid anymore grow up, to blow up the spot you're at
Learn the skill and go to the top of that
Cercle Rouge definitely rockin in rap
KRS-One I got your back
Chorus
KRS-One with the freestyle rhyme
Representing Cercle Rouge in France
All the graffiti artists
we like to breakdance to the MC yes you know that's me
KRS-One down with the BDP
From way back you know we take it like that
Kenny P and Zizwe, Will-Dee, gods of rap
We do it like this, do it like that

Well my ladies and gentlemen
This is a rapsession and my name is ""KRS-One!""
And when I talk about ""Hip-Hop Music!"", I know
[Kris]
One  : Breaking or breakdancing
Rally b-boying, freestyle or streetdancin'
Two  : MC'ing or rap
Divine speech what I'm doing right now no act
Three: Grafitti art or burning bombin'
Taggin', writin', now you're learning! uh!
Four : DJ'ing, we ain't playing!
{*scratch*} You know what I'm saying!
Five : Beatboxing
Give me a {*beatboxin*} Yes and we rockin'!
Six  : Street fashion, lookin' fly
Catchin' the eye while them cats walk on by
Seven: Street language, our verbal communication
Our codes throughout the nation
Eight: Street knowledge, common sense
The wisdom of the elders from way back whence
Nine : Street entrepreneur realism
No job, just get up call 'em and get 'em
Here's how I'm tellin' it, all 9 Elements
We stand in love, no we're never failing it
Intelligent? No doubt
Hip-Hop? We're not selling it out, we're just lettin' it out
If you're checkin' us out this hour, we teatchin' hip-hop
Holy integrated people have it, I'm the present power!
[Chorus]
Rap is something you do!
3x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
Rap is something you do!
Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
[Kris]
Skaters, BMX-bike riders rock
Don't you ever stop! You are hip-hop
You doing the same things we did on our block in the suburbs
You know you be packing that black block
Selling that crackrock and ecstacy
Gettin' pissydrunk, fallin' out next to me
But like I told those in the ghettoes
Here's the facts! True hip-hop is so much more than that
Some much more than rap, so much more than beats
Hip-hop is all about victory over the streets
What you see on TV is a lie
That's not something you wanna live or pattern your life by
But, huh that's too much preachin' ain't it?
You don't want the ?education?, you wanna be dead on the pavement
Well, so be it, some of ya'll ain't gonna see it
Others wanna enslave your mind! Kris wanna free it!
[Chorus]
Rap is something you do!
5x Hip-Hop is something you live! *scratched*
""Oh yea"" *scratched* --- From ""P is dead""
""I have spent my whole life livin'"", ""talk to the fullest"", ""no doubt""
[Kris]
You know that's why these rappers can't hang
Cause the essence of hip-hop is not a material thang
They so careless, hip-hop is in a {?} we give
Rap we do, hip-hop we live
How many times I gotta say it? How the radio ain't gonna play it
And you hip-hoppers sit back and okay it
Think about it! (think about it)
The present course of action, we have got to reroute it!
[Chorus: repeat 3X]
Hip-Hop is something you live!

Intro: Redman
Hey baby bring me something to drink in here
Sit down and watch a little TV.
[KRS One]
(static) Yo they comin'. It's crazy but I know it they comin'. Maybe not
lately I feel it coming. I knew it  they comin'. (static) This just in.
President (static) I guarentee (static) Jim...Jimmy  Jimmy wake up. Jimmy!
(static) Only the Lord can save (static) 5.99 no obligation (static) Let me
start to rock this mic (static) Now the polar bear hybernates (static) And
and what was going through your mind right now.
KRS-1:
Look aat these weak MC's getting G's
Never wore BVD's or even bellbottom Lees
Please, with these fantisies about you selliing keys
When you know you bees in front of the TV eatin' grilled cheese
On your knees you know my steez
Kris is nice with theses M-I-Cs
I'm Poison like BBD the plot thickens while I be hitten
And lyric lickin', flippin' any mix and over the skippin'
And cable clippin', still sickenin'
Even though some people ain't admitting
Through they system I keeps it kickin'
And tippin' the scale I pay tuiton not bail
Drink water not ale, MC Hammer hits it right on the nail
I can't fail with my 7 stripes
Strike one pierces the lung over the drum MC's become dumb
Like ""um?"" They numb, bite the tongue over the bass drum
I am D the MC like Run, spittin' lyrics for fun
And for a sum of the bread crumb
You missed when you swung, I connected whole hum
Another one done underestimated KRS-1, yeah so...
Hook:
Redman: Say blowe
KRS-1: If you really want true skill
Redman: Say blowe
KRS-1: If you want the hip hop to build
Redman:Say blowe
KRS-1: We rock it all year round
Redman: You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth
KRS-1:
It's just beguuuun, to bubble
KRS-Onnnne spells trouble
On the mic soooon there is no double
I emerge from under the rumble
Count the truth poetic construction, audio abduction
Showbiz production for wack lyric reduction
And fly rhyme instruction keep the party hoppin'
Keep the DJs buggin' for the orthodox
Non Xerox hip hop chatter box
It was dope first crack out the box with Scott LaRock
How MC's are washed up like sweat socks
KRS-1 makes the heads nod
Hook
Redman: KRS-1
KRS-!: Yes my son
Redman: Tweet tweet (x2)
KRS-1: You know they can't compete, ain't that right
Redman:
No doubt. You better cool the F out before we go up in your mouth
KRS-1:
When it's my turn kid, look at what you done did
Like my head is dreadable you edible
I kick incredible shit, for my poeple
I'm jackin' these like me so sue and Stretch like Bobbito overloops
While you sittin' on stoops I'm rockin' mics for U.S. troops in group
You screwed up, oops, I can read a true crook
Like I can read a good book
I'm hooked on hip hop culture
Look at the tip top lyrical structure
Floatin' like a soap bubble that you don't wann puncture
Or rupture, I write what I udder, mother mother mother
There's too many of us dying still trying and not doin'
Not suceeding still pursueing what you doing?
What you doing? What you doing?
The session is started departed on schedule
I beg you please lookover my lyrical menu
What other can't do I can do
Enhancing 7 levels of your mental
I dismantel stress, you're listening to the advanced lyrical best
Worldwide qualified to administer any MC test
Stop guessin' class is in full session
Now Showbiz show 'em how

Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you see a devil down
Ah yeah, that's whatcha say when you take the devil's crown
Ah yeah, stay alive all things will change around
Ah yeah, what?  Ah yeah!
Verse One: KRS-One
So here I go kickin science in ninety-five
I be illin, parental discretion is advised still
dont call me nigga, this MC goes for his
Call me God, cause that's what the black man is
Roamin through the forest as the hardest lyrical artist
Black women you are not a bitch you're a Goddess
Let it be known, you can lean on KRS-One
Like a wall cause I'm hard, I represent GOD
Wack MC's have only one style: gun buck
But when you say, ""Let's buck for revolution""
They shut the fuck up, kid, get with it
Down to start a riot in a minute
You'll hear so many Bowe-Bowe-Bowe, you think I'm Riddick
While other MC's are talkin bout up with hope down with dope
I'll have a devil in my infrared scope, WOY!
That's for calling my father a boy and, KLAK KLAK KLAK!
That's for putting scars on my mother's back, BO!
That's for calling my sister a hoe, and for you
BUCK BUCK BUCK, cause I don't give a motherfuck
Remember the whip, remember the chant, remember about rope and
you black people still thinkin about vot-ing
Every president we ever had lied
You know I'm kinda glad Nixon died!
Chorus
Verse Two: KRS
This is not the first time I came to the planet
But everytime I come, only a few could understand it
I came as Isis, my words they tried to ban it
I came as Moses, they couldn't follow my commandments
I came as Solomon, to a people that was lost
I came as Jesus, but they nailed me to a cross
I came as Harriet Tubman, I put the truth to Sojourner
Other times, I had to come as Nat Turner
They tried to burn me, lynch me and starve me
So I had to come back as Marcus Garvey, Bob Marley
They tried to harm me, I used to be Malcolm X
Now I'm on the planet as the one called KRS
Kickin the metaphysical, spiritual, tryin to like
get wit you, showin you, you are invincible
The Black Panther is the black answer for real
In my spiritual form,  I turn into Bobby Seale
On the wheels of steel, my spirit flies away
and enters into Kwame Ture
Chorus
Verse Three: KRS-One
In the streets there is no EQ, no di-do-di-do-di-do
So I grab the air and speak through the code
the devil cannot see through as I unload
into another cerebellum
Then I can tell em, because my vibes go through denim
and leather whatever, however, I'm still rockin
We used to pick cotton, now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
Have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
Yo hear me kid, government is building in a pyramid
The son of God is brighter than the son of man
The spirit is, check your dollar bill G, here it is
We got no time for fancy mathematics
Your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
Makin you a naked body, attic and it's democratic
They press auto, and you kill it with an automatic

Uhh!  They don't wanna battle
They ain't ready for the battle, uh-uh, uh-uh (Temple of Hip-Hop)
Listen, listen, listen
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Your spirit AIN'T READY
Your church AIN'T READY
Your bishop AIN'T READY
Your deacons AIN'T READY
Your choir AIN'T READY
Your ushers AIN'T READY
At the Temple of Hip-Hop
WE TEACH MANY!
[KRS-One]
Look!  To all my people hurtin, all my people searchin
What we know for sure, God is always workin
Workin while you flirtin, workin while you jerkin
Workin while the world is turnin and these cities burnin
God is always workin, workin while you learnin
Workin while you ignorant and when you're not concernin
Christ consciousness, get that, got that
Spit that, rock that, hip that, hop that
You sniff that?  Stop that, I give back and got back
Greedy?  I'm not that, you needy for that shock rap
Slangin on the block rap, duckin where the cops at
I don't know that, but Jesus done copped that
Not that man on the cross, it ain't like that
You must act like the son of God, that's where the lights at
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
One thing's for sure and believe it hurt
It's when the pastor ain't sure, and deceives the church
They don't know God's law, and can't see God at work
So when they see hip-hop, they push it to the back of the church
Like fig trees or figures they don't bear fruit
They gospel artists, still tryin to chase that loot
Hear the truth now, I come to enhance the light
They women of God, singin while they pants is tight?
They not hot!  Really they, regular
They clothes they flows, all that, secular
What's the difference I could stay in the world and wild
if these church girls wear more makeup than Destiny's Child
Keep it real Christian, some of y'all liftin ain't likin
But this is the difference between a Christian and a Christ-ian
Stop readin only and start bein show me
Like the resurrection I'll be back, they can't hold me
.. listen, listen, listen
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
Look!  Spiritual minded, you must find it
Find your spirit and go deep inside it
This goes out to the Christ-ians listenin
This is the flow that, gospel's missin it's
urban inspirational rap
We got our own section in the record stores, in our own rack
We respect tradition, from the start
But we now know, the true word of God is written in our heart
We gotta say somethin to the streets kid!
All these churches surroundin the devil still ain't defeat it?
They the type to get down, I'm the type to get up
From ""Criminal"" to ""Spiritual Minded"", now raise your head up
Let me start, these rappers ain't got God in they heart
All they want is quick money, and a movie part
Let me begin - what, where, why or when
What's the use of double platinum if you're livin in sin
Hear the truth - how long you think you gonna last
rockin the mic, without havin to go back to class?
Now you're forced, to listen to the teacher outrap them
Yes there's life after platinum

It ain't the same now (it ain't the same)
They switched the game now (they switched up on us)
They talk 'bout chains now (bling bling)
Rims on the Range now
It's sounding plain now
Y'all rock the same style (sound of the mic)
I know the way how (I know)
Bring it back to one
It's supposed to be...
[KRS]
This is the way it's supposed to be
It's supposed to be like you more close to me
It's supposed to be about our families
It's supposed to be about avoiding catastrophe
But it's all about salary and flattery
Distrust, lust, hate and tragedy
It's supposed to be about you and me on the same route
Were you there in eighty-six when I first came out?
And you know about how they runnin' this game out
It's supposed to be about fun and getting' the pain out
But it's all about clout and poppin' them chains out
Instead of forgiveness, we poppin' they brains out
It's supposed to be about seekin' in the seek out
You witnessin' injustice, you got to speak out
If you claimin' you love this, you got to release doubt
Knowledge is what I'm all about
[Chorus]
[KRS]
Well it's supposed to be sunlight over me
Light over you, not you runnin' over me
It's supposed to be a two dollar royalty minimum
A Hiphop guild—we got to begin buildin' 'em
It's supposed to be NO police brutality
And the fact that we tolerate that crap is insanity
It's supposed to be museums and archives
Where people can see the importance of OUR lives
But it ain't about any of this
Cats are trying to get that diamond-studded Rolex on they wrist
You hear a voice in the wilderness—you know it's Kris
Higher consciousness lyrics, they will persist
But it's supposed to be about makin' it better
You see, Hiphop's not a product like pants or sweater
Go ahead—be a hero, get your cheddar
Even y'all gonna see when you look back you remember that
[Chorus]
[KRS]
You can see in your heart how it's supposed to be
You doin' your part, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Pursuin' your art, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
Today you will start, THAT'S how it's supposed to be
It shouldn't be about you movin' slowly
Then talkin' junk when you don't even know me
And you cats be pussy like Josie
I +Touch+ ""50 MC's"" like +Tony+

Four out of nine talk about drugs and crime
Three out of four say they wit it but they not
Two out of five spit fire plus the underground
One out of three spit righteous but they never shine
One out of two claim they ballin all the time
And only one make it to prime
Do that math, only one Biggie, one Pac, one Jay-Z

well..(open up its the D.E.A.)
ah man, just when I went for more led
my door opens up wit the beam to my forehead
wit nowhere to escape, I thought I was dead
but I woke up instead in a cell on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard a crack sound
2 D.T.'s came in and layed they glocks down
one was whistlin a love song, he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn somethings wrong
boom bap, boom bap against my head
I fell back on my bed, down to his feet
the pain was insane but the hit was sweet
cuz these dumb ass cops punched me right by the heat
the glock, 2 shots, 3 shots they screamin
then someone said..(ay wake up kid your dreamin)
I said what dreamin, that nightmare was hell
but as I look around, I was still in my cell
damn I got myself caught up in a jam
the D.T. that woke me up was like WHAT
I wiped the saliva off my mouth
then the D.T. said..(lets make a deal)
no doubt no question, now started up the session
no need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think theres anyone higher
he said..(dont be a god damned lier)
you killed 3 D.T.'s yesterday you heard me
but still the cops you knocked off, yesterday was dirty
now the whole investigation is federal
we want you to point out the rest of the cops that are criminal
he continued to say you cant think it thru
this whole drug game is bigger than you
follow our plan man and you'll be free
let me explain one thing so you can see
we....
Chorus
Now Im back in the herb gate all wired up
constantly thinkin about being tied up
snap out of it, Im thinkin damn we like l's
the federal and local cops got laws wit themselves
and Im in the middle and cant solve the riddle
my nose is runny {knock of door}..(let me get a 20)
a 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown
give me the whole brown clown or duck down {gunshots}
god damn, god damn, here we go again
but this time Im set up by my federal friends
suddenly I hear (yo move from the door) {gunshot}
followed by the shots sounded like a 4-4 {gunshot}
after the violence, then there was silence
then I heard (ah yo its us, open up the door)
but rule number one, in this game is self reliance
so I pickd up the mini Mac incase they wanted more
the door opened up, the feds said what up
they was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
suddenly a sense of trust came over me
thought to myself.. .well soon I'll be free
but as I turned around I heard the gun go click
I said wait...but it was too late {gunshot}

Brown skin woman, you a queen, not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Brown skin woman you a queen and not a HOE
Any man that drop the lyric what we give them the BO
Verse One:
We don't come with disrespect, we come with intellect
If you come with disrespect you get a rope around your neck
Some people don't expect me, to be so violent
But me NAH violent, just myself I protect
Too many time I see, young gwal pickadee
Pay five ten twenty thirty dollar to see
some rapper some singer some .. celebrity
Talk bout they wan fi sex up and fill up you body
But them NAH talk about peelin off some money
for the pumpin onna bed, when you haf the baby
Whattaya think can happen next? After you're done havin sex?
Too much of ignorance, not enough intellence
Mahn me NOT against sex, but too many DJ

Cause the next day them gone, and you sit alone
Got em soup up your mic, pon de micraphone
Chorus (w/ minor variations)
Verse Two:

So dem whip up your bod', and dem whippin not stop
But dem NAH can't stop us wit de whip and de chain
So dem take away your history, erase your name

Uhh, unh, uhh!  Unh, uh, uhh, uh, uhh, uhh
(Yeah bring somethin in a little like that yo!)
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*
(repeat 4X)
Yo, get with your culture it'll catapult ya
Ignorance is like a vulture and it will insult ya
My name is Krash, Joe Krash, Big Joe Krash
Built to last, education for mass
Never take a dive yo, strive for the livin
Today is a beginning, for you to start winning
You cannot walk around town like you a idiot
Livin it with some Boyz N Tha Hood is your affiliate
That's simply ignorant, really that's the enemy
Train your brain to attain your identity
Self construction not Self Destruction
if you're tryin to be a gangster, you're buggin
If you're not movin ahead yo, you're buggin
You gotta look at yourself, and try to change somethin, huh
So check the animation for the nation of the -- money
My name is Krash, I'm way live and I'm also funny
This is the underground way to put knowledge in your brain
But first we gotta break the chain, c'mon
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*

Word! *echoes*
Break the Chain, Break the Chain! *clink*

Yo, I don't wanna be a dummy walkin round smellin funny
lookin bummy or crummy with no money (Go!!!)
But when I go to school the teacher ain't teachin
And when I go to church the preacher ain't preachin
Who they think they reachin, the old style is dead
Instead wake up the knowledge in your own head
With new ideas you got fewer fears
and with fewer fears, you can get paid in it for years
Yo, take a look around where you at
If you think it's wack, educate yourself and change that (wack!)
I'm fallin down and I can't get up I ain't buyin it
Change the way you think, you'll change your environment
We weren't always slaves or livin in caves
This is what we learned, so this is how we now behave
You can get new ideas by lookin ALL around
Read lips, and ask questions on what is goin down (yeah)
Break the chain that used to be on your foot
Now it's on your mind, behind your eyes
You can't vote, you can't see it, you can't believe it
I'm breakin the chain of ignorance, anything you can achieve it (yeah)
Open your eyes, realize I'm bein God
Enough of the lies, let's rise and

Friday....
You you can't can't be be ripping the mic the mic
like do re me me measels are contagious like my lyrical pages
ripping and flipping the mic
from back in the back in the days the days its kinda hectic hectic
when these suckas don't respect it  check it. Flame on.
I know the light is bright but keep on watching me
I'm stolen property, kicking the flavor to society.
Police be clocking me, but logically they got to be
cause they were taught that serious poetry would come from Socrates.
But that ain't it, in 94 I'll kick the hit
and if I was in front of Shakespear, battle a punk and take his shit.
I'm not having it,
bust a narrative and come to get with it.
Rap is something you do, hip hop is something you live.
The difference is kids nowadays, they got the videos.
Rappers don't need skills to build so they don't really know.
Hear me yo, I'm four times on Arsenio,
got ten videos, but does that help me flow? No.
That's why when I come to the show MC's act like they don't know
cause they were too young to rock up in the disco
Frisco disco the disc is like a Nabisco
chocolate chip cookie, don't fuck with me rookie.
I'm rocking beats and
with death defying feats and
I'm never sneaking
always peeping when I'm speaking
inside I'm keeping a statement for police and
I'm down for peace and but not turn the other cheek and
so this DJ, he gets down
mixing records while they go
round and round round we go
two years ago a friend of mine
and Flash is gonna rock your mind
welcome to the Terrordome, the Terrordome
I wonder if I take you home
E-F-F-E-C-T a cool operator operating correctly
but back in the day I knew rap would never die
too late baby bwai
bai in a body boy head head
head insane in the membrane
take the train, take the train
M-E-T-H-O-D Man
'Hattan keeps on making it
Brooklyn keeps on taking it
We keep coming back with more and more hits
party people, I came through the door, I said it before
Two years ago, super hoe
If my train goes off the track,
pick it up, pick it up, pick it up back back
back to the grill again, the grill again
friends
how many MC's must get dissed?
Before somebody says don't fuck with Chris
Hey! Ho! Keep on moving don't stop no
body beats the Biz
Let's do the dance called the Pee Wee Herman
Hey, Erick Sermon, Hey
you you get off my cloud,
go down baby, go down baby, the gods must be crazy

Every once in a while
You got to put aside childish things
And get with the teachers and the kings
K-R-S... Truck Turner...
Bring It To The Cypher
Like this, like this y'all
[Verse One: Truck Turner]
I'm at the end of my rope, I'm bout to snap
Cut a nigga throat, put a bullet through his hat
With his head attached
What's the deal new jack? Who dat? Got his chest blew back
Clak! Clak! Bullet through his teeth, nigga true that
You in my way, move that, Truck coming through that
Run up in your spot, come out, raising two gats
Move back, give a nigga room, let me hit this
Way back, since up in the womb, I was with this
Every sentence, we doom with consistence
Be the witness, let me spit this, Kris hit this
[KRS-One]
Yo... if it's all about the hundreds, let's try to get two 50s
Don't stop and switch a temple, let's work and build a city
You see the equation, to this whole situation?
If I'm the God of rap and you battling me, you Satan
And that's why you hating, creating debates
When you know damn well that your title will be taken
[Hook: 2X]
You think you all that son?
BRING IT TO THE CYPHER!
You only got platinum?
BRING IT TO THE CYPHER!
You think you got props son?
BRING IT TO THE CYPHER!
You living Hip Hop son?
BRING IT TO THE CYPHER!
[Verse Two: KRS-One]
Yo... daytime, nighttime, anytime, I got plenty time
To kick many rhymes, big time, all time
Taking it to you over time, so when I'm flowing rhymes
Bright I shine, simply cuz I'm
Lyrically be kicking out the tighter rhyme, till I climb
Bring in the chime, in your mind, you fall behind
Picking up your rhyming skill, I am fulfilled, when I kill at will
Still number one for fun, kill another one
Battle your bugging son
Look I cut your tongue, KRS-One is never done
I am the proper one, this ass-whipping will make you better son
Go and tell your mum I took a bite out of your bum
Anytime you want it, doggone it, yo put me on it
Never running up on it, you never disappointed, get on it
I simply jam, not that I give a damn
Let me tell you who I am, just ask your buddy
Put your cash on Kris, I bet you double up your money
You can call me Chris Rock, ain't nothing funny
[Truck Turner]
Nigga what, let me change my style up, in a rough
Nigga duck, dropped your face, pick it up, shook 'em up
Automatic fire ? Brrrrrrrruh! Brrrrrrrruh!
All up in the party, clip it out, give it up
[KRS-One]
Where's the money for this single, get it out, give it up
Blastmaster's coming through Truck, what
[Hook: 2X]
[Verse Three: Truck Turner]
That night I let the fo'-fo' bark, spark right off the dark
Body parts chalked, where we live, how we get down
Come up on my block making noise, keep the shit down
I cripple you, pull up a wheelchair, permanent sit-down
Perfect fit now, now clown, who the shit now?
Fo'-fo' aimed at your dome, bout to spit rounds
Me and you, getting it on? Don't even go there
Once I bring it to you, you won't be save nowhere
Oh yeah, your mom's funeral don't even show there
It'll be a double burial dukes, when the smoke clears
Love you like a brother, but I'll kill you if you rally
Stay on my good side, my bad side, I annihilate
Don't hold me back, get off me, told these kats never cross me
But they crossed the line, I gotta show 'em
My fo'-fo' snub is what I owe 'em, Kris you know him? (Nah)
Ice pick, adequate style, I'm bout to blow him
Dudes get trifle, catch the barrel of the rifle
Fuck you, until more niggaz looking just like you
Don't toot, when you hear me squeeze off the cycles
I squeeze you load (I squeeze you reload)
I squeeze you reload till this whole shit can roll
Where I'm from, that's the code, BDP got your shit sold
Like bad heads that fold at war, anything goes
Made us, broke the mold, another Bronx episode nigga what

After seven years of rockin'
How do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly?
Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's  funny to me  you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be
In the Army
Not knowin' your history
You either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politican can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be
Because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave
You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our opressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God, the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level...
Verse Two:
Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and
Kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicans would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame
We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture
Same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha
Religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measels
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Belivers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' with them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michaelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
Let me take you to a higher level...

You don't understand, why you're publically banned

What kind of party is this, it's that political kind
Where America's best, most hypocritical minds
Try they hands at keepin y'all deaf dumb and blind

Because my schools is graves and jobs is plantations --

You marryin the dirt and I'ma throw in the tux for free
I tell the people what they wanna hear
I make em laugh and cheer, and then they re-elect me every year
So when the coast is clear, I stop duckin
and start back doin dope, cussin and fuckin
I kiss the babies, shake hands, wave and smile for flicks

But I'm not havin it, I load the SLR
Pack the ganja BOOM!  They break down the door

Out of three Babylon, me hit one in the brain
Pop-pop!  Two shots hit da window pane
I exchanged four shots, I drop and feel pain
but I'm not hit, into the bathroom I crawl
I look out the window, it's a one story fall

I'm in another herb gate like a superstar
Eleven A.M., things are safe so far
I used to worry 'bout the competition on the block
But now the competition on the block is the cops
And even block watch doesn't know where we lay
Well.. (""Open up!  It's the D.E.A.!"")
Aww man, just when I went for more lead
The door opens up, I got a glock to my forehead
(""Get down! Get on the floor!"") I felt the stick, I thought I was dead
But I woke up instead in a cell layin on my bed
I lay back down, then I heard the crack sound
Two D.T.'s came in and laid they glocks down
One was whistlin a love song, as he put some gloves on
I thought to myself, damn something's wrong
Boom bap!  Boom ba,p against my head
I fell back on the bed, down to his feet
The pain was insane but the hit was sweet
Cause these dumb-ass cops punched me right by the heat
The glock, two shots, three shots they screamin
Then someone said... (""Hey wake up kid, you're dreamin!"")
I said, ""Yo dreamin?!  That nightmare was hell""
But as I look around, I was still in my cell
Damn, I got myself caught up in a jam
The D.T. that woke me up was like, WHAT?!
I wiped the saliva, off my mouth
The D.T. said.. (""Let's make a deal"") No doubt!
No question, now we started up the session
No need for guessin, yes they want my supplier
I said, what makes you think there's anyone higher?
He said.. (""Don't be a God damned liar!"")
You killed three D.T.'s yesterday, you heard me
But still the cops you knocked off yea was dirty
Now the whole investigation is federal
We want you to point out, the rest of the cops that are criminal

[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
Now I'm back in the herb gate, all wired up
Constantly thinkin about bein tied up
Snap out of it - I'm thinkin, ""Damn we like elves!
The federal and local cops got wars with themselves;
and I'm in the middle, and can't solve the riddle.
My nose is runny.."" {*knock at door*} (""Let me get a 20!"")
A 20 of the green or a 20 of the brown?
(""Gimme the whole pound, clown, or duck down!"") {*gunfire*}
God damn, God damn, here we go again
But this time I'm set up by my federal friend
Suddenly I hear.. (""Yo, move from the door!"") {*two shots*}
Followed by the shot sounded like a four-four {*two shots*}
After the violence, then there was silence
Then I heard.. (""Hey yo it's us, open up the door!"")
But rule number one in this game is self-reliance
So I pickd up the mini-mac in case they wanted more
The door opened up, the feds said WHATTUP?
They was stickin you up, so they had to get bucked
Suddenly a sense of trust came over me
I thought to myself, ""Well soon I'll be free!""
But as I turned around, I heard the gun go click {*clik-clak*}
I said wait, but it was too late - {*GUNSHOT*}

I am the incarnation of what you do
When you try to forget KRS, I try to forget you
You tired of me saying what's real hip hop
Well I'm tired of you biting my shit to go pop
This is why we need hip hop history
'Cause if we had it, you knew you shouldn't get with me
I'm free, I don't need MTV
I could smash your click like 1-2-3
You think I care if you plat-in-um
Where I come from, we be slappin' em' uh
Sales dont make you the authority
It only means you sold out to the white majority
What you know about seniority you ain't major
Ya whole album appeals to little second graders
Grow up already, before I slap that hiny
And put you out of work like Tavis Smiley
I got that razor tounge, you be on the ground with paramedics saying ""We
can't save this one""
I stay alert like red, you keep sucking me uh 'cause you think I'm ahead
But you ain't street soldier, I'll take one of ya members
Cut off his head and send it to Lisa Evers
We will be here for ever and ever and ever
While you'll be over by next September

We got a million DMX's, a thousand Jay-Z's
A hundred Eminem's and two million Master P's
But I think for drastically, 'cause Tone Def always flow with originality,
that's the way it has to be
And if you patchin' me for the first or the third time
And even if you search wide for new styles
You still ain't never heard mine
With the thrust of a turbine, I blur by
Most of y'all niggas can't really get with me
But I know your girl sure try
But that's alright, 'cause you probably prefer guys to fur pie
That's why your shorty turned bi, she like that silky stir fry
With her skirt hiked to an absurd height
She by the curb like, ""Don't swerve alright""
If you got the wood she got the termites
It's Tone Def, the vocalism more tread than a dirt bike
Cats be like ram ya tounge is rough, ""Yo that hurts right?""
I blurt my explanation on my worst night, last heard that twelve mics
thought I was siamese 'cause you got served twice
I don't want to hear about your perp life
Forced to record CBS just to remember what it's like to survive
You hypocritical types a pitiful willin' to serve lies
To reserve ice, but need to work for Adidas to earn stripes
My first strike, leave you with burned eyes all for the turn-pike
And man be looking for you surfside armored the search light
Most cats that use the term nice never been in a word fight
Don't think you just observe for return price
Well your church might

See I could care less if you carry a gat
You a liar brothers getting locked for that
All that olympic size pool you could drown in that
I'm a true school cat and I'm proud of that
You could see me decked out in a gown and cap
While you killin' our people with a pound of crack
What you think player, you ain't going down for that
Your lyrics prove you ain't looking out in fact
You a traitor and the worst kind at that
In the future your kids gonna account for that
We will never stop spittin' the facts no trouble
He forgot about the struggle, I'm bringing it back
I ain't mad or angry or any of that
All I know is my people died so I could rap
And what we do when we spit nigga, bitch, ho, dick
We need to switch that to my brother, my sister quick

[KRS] Yeah that's the one    yo Thor El just just check your mic
Verse One: Thor El
So you wanna be the million dollar man  kid what's your plan
Make a deal with the devil settle for a hundred grand
Not enough I call your bluff  hit you with the stuff
Deal with this and think you're tough  gimme a call when things get rough
You get no Vette and  if I could stay leaded
I'm leavin rappers one-legged from fakin like the prosthetic
you're artificial by cripple, rap is like your pistol
Grim Reaper, I got the whistle, death I pull no tissue
Hit you, like the Mac-11, MC's subtract by seven
Callin callin for the reverand, lookin at hell like heaven
I'm on the map, makin it like the crazy on the track
Oh what the hell I get my mail while I raid you til it crack
Chorus: KRS and Thor-El
H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
H, I, P, H, O, P, we are
Verse Two: KRS-One
C'mon, uhh
Dead two in the head before some A&R tell me
I must give up the streets you lift the company can sell me
What's the sense in being large if you can't take a risk?
Thinkin a risk upon a disc means you're written off the list
I'm not sayin you can't have your fame and glory just don't bore me
when I come to see you live, and I paid twenty-five
That's, crazy loot Kris is saying I don't play those games
Killing Rhyme Sessions is the meaning of my name
But don't call my name in vain, cause I will appear
And your livest MC will get slain right here
See I do the homework, and I do the extra credit
You could sell a million records, and still can't set it
Cause the Lex or Beem is probably just the matches and a Jeep so
I'm sure your rap career now if they come before your people
Ohh Lord!! You can't be thinkin about Billboard
With the mic cord, and several thousand people just bored
Being dope live is like being insured for life
You always get called back twice, you are
Chorus 2X
Verse Three: Thor-El, KRS-One
I burn like hy-dra-cho-loric and my city got itty
He's terrible, Thor-El's incredible and terrific
Is it, that you're under the influence of local obvious
Rappers that die, but why, explain the obvious
No stoppin this lyrics from the esophagus
rockin strictly the hip-hop populace

Knowledge  where the people at?
Free Mumia!
Channel Live! (KRS One  come and represent)
(The wisdom)
Hah hah hah hah hah hahaha!
Free Mumia!
Everywhere I look there's another house negro
Talkin about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin but the conversation ain't goin nowhere
You can't diss hip hop  so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker  you wanna quote the scripture
Everytime you hear nigga, listen up sista
Verse One: Hakim, KRS, Tuffy
I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a b-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
in the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, ""You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria""
Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love
She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said, ""You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets""
Got em drivin Benzes Jeeps and Rolls Royces
Attackin me will leave youth with no voices
The choice is yours not mine hang with me
I'll have you freestyle and bombin graffiti
We can cut it up like like wax
Claimin I cause violence but America was violent before rap, FACT
Chorus: KRS-One
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia
(repeat 2X)
Verse Two: Tuffy, KRS, Hakim
Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like the _Final
Call_ as I watch, Babylon fall
I had to Rush Limbaugh, get that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin cannons that's phat
Because he censors the uses of the metaphor
You can get the dick bum up
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin, gut from the poor
Why sure! Back before we were born they sold us out
Yeah Dade Jackson we know what you about
Youse a Slave Mason, not a Free Mason
Before long the Goddess Tiamat through hip-hop you'll be facin
Don't start me, cause I be the, lyricist
At the nineteen ninety-nine millenium party held at Giza
Sayin he's a, fraud, oh my Goddess
Never in your life should you disrespect an artist
Instead, focus your attention on astronomy
And the up and coming, shift in the economy
If you can't do that, then heed the final call
To free Mumia, Abu-Jamal
Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggaz are full of crap, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension (revolution)
You paint the pictures, the black man on the corner
But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim that voice from the East
Chorus
Verse Three: KRS, Hakim, Tuffy
Buck buck! Buck buck buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the plot
of a chicken, definition, is what you're missin and
listen to your children instead of dissin em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the young people
Like they be sayin want to, but we be sayin wanna
They gettin dumber every summer as they walk the rope
Maybe because they cannot understand the quotes
Word, in actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
For degrees full circle, dead from the purple
rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revalations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm audi hundred forty four thousand with my people
From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwartzeneggar
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
the rock cock back the glock, cause I don't trust
the Devil I rebel until Babylon is dust

Thou knowest not what thou sayeth in speech?

So evil has hold of thy lyric
Whomsoever shall hear it shall adapt it
And walk the talk of evil just as ye rapped it
But I cometh forth today to say thus
Evil is an illusion, in GOD we trust
In Satan we lust
Coveting thy brother's vehicle while riding the bus

Okay now, listen to this..
{*sound effect: seagulls*}
A mystical teacher sat by the seaside
It was about five o'clock cause we heard the free ride
Anyway; the teacher was talking in stride
sitting upon a rock that was wide
and warning against false pride
""Come to where I reside!"" a woman cried
and the teacher replied, ""Do you serve your fish fried?""
""Yes,"" she replied, ""with potato salad on the side.""
And the teacher replied, ""Well where do you reside?""
She said, ""Up on the hillside, it's not a far ride.
If you came to have dinner, I would be so gratified.""
The teacher replied, ""It's six o'clock, seven o'clock, you decide.""
She replied, ""Seven o'clock, do you like stir-fried?""
She was mystified and felt so dignified
The teacher was coming to the house where she resides
So she purified with pesticides
{*sound effect: chemicals sprayed*}
Called her friends up nationwide
{*sound effect: phone being dialed*}
Some of her friends were tongue-tied they felt so glorified
She made steamed fish, baked fish, fish that was fried
Soup, steamed vegetables, potato salad on the side
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
You could smell the bread in the oven far and wide
Natural juices and water purified
Organic fruits brought from the countryside
with silver forks and knives placed side by side
{*sound effect: silverware clinks*}
You could not be dissatisfied;
looking out the window staring at the mountainside,
you would have died
6:59 she's swollen with pride
As the moment intensified, there's a knock from outside
{*sound effect: door knocking*}
She opens the door, for the teacher has arrived
{*sound effect: door creaks open*}
But to her surprise, it was a bum who cried
""Please, I smelt the bread from outside!
One piece,"" and then she replied
""The teacher is coming, he's soon to have arrived.
You're making me look bad, come on now, step aside!""
The bum then replied,
""When I say I'm hungry I haven't lied.
Give me some of that chicken that you just fried.""
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
She replied, ""Chicken - fried?
No that's for the teacher, you're not purified""
Then she slammed the door and went back inside
{*sound effect: door closes*}
Sat on the couch with the TV Guide
She looked at the clock, it was 7:09, then 7:30;
he still hasn't arrived
Eight o'clock, she's on the downside
Nine o'clock, by now she's teary-eyed
She's pissed off and her anger multiplied
She cried, then fell asleep dissatisfied
Next day she woke up, and was preoccupied
with meeting the mystical teacher who lied
Where could he hide?
She ran down by the seaside
{*sound effect: seagulls*}
He was there teaching about - false pride
""You lied!"" she replied, ""You lied!
You said you'd be there at seven o'clock, you lied!""
He replied, ""No I have not lied.
I came at 6:59, and you told me to move aside.
I asked for bread and the chicken that was fried.
{*sound effect: food cooking*}
And you said, that I wasn't purified.""
She replied, ""I wasn't notified!
I had no idea that you was the bum that cried!""
And the teacher sighed, then replied,
""This concludes our lesson on false pride.""

All they want is your cash, ass, glass, gas and a flick
When you ask for that autograph, they ass dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we BUST OFF the gatler
He's more of an actor, someone, into theater
Not an upright MC with styles who speaks clearer!
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
MC's have no time for the bar
Unless we politickin a tape to some drunk A&R
We grab the mic and say who we are, KRS
And start takin it to the chest of the best
This is not a test or a demo
This is when you let go of the limo, like many can't do
They may wanna amp you and chant new, record sellin
But movin the crowd is somethin that they can't do!
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
C'mon!
You got to be mistaken, I am not your boy
You fake what you creatin, playin wit'cha toys
G'wan with all that bullshit bout you bringin noise
Time for somethin more than PO-PO-POI-POI
All of hip-hop ain't seventeen
Some of us still go back to ""Microphone Fiend""
Back when it was just MC's and DJ's
No video that come on and just replay
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
Uhhh... uh-huh, uh-huh uh-huh
We can never stop, forever we rock, take a listen
The t'cha is back, cause rap's whack when I'm missin
Me, I would never want the future to believe
that when they trust to look back on us there was no dope MC's
There was, all these rappers grabbin more and more money
And now that I'm A&R they look more and more funny
They rap for platinum plaques without buildin
a cultural strategy worthy of our children!

Free Mumia!
Channel Live! (KRS-One, come and represent)
(The wisdom)
Hah hah hah hah hah hahaha!
Free Mumia!
Everywhere I look there's another house negro
Talkin about they people and how they should be equal
They talkin but the conversation ain't goin nowhere
You can't diss hip-hop, so don't you even go there
C. Delores Tucker, you wanna quote the scripture
Everytime you hear nigga, listen up sista
Verse One: Hakim, KRS, Tuffy
I met up with this girl named Delores, a prankster
I said I MC, she said, ""You're a gangster""
But she was caught up, she hit the floor like a breakdance
Wrapped her up like the arms in a b-boy stance
Recognize moms I'm one of your sons I'm hip-hop
in the form of Channel Live and KRS-One
Representin MC's across America
She said, ""You're the one who be causin all that mass hysteria""
Wisdom shall come out of the mouths of babes and sucklings
But you blinded by cultural ignorance and steady judging
But judge not, lest ye may be judged
For the judgment ye judge ye shall surely be judged, you gets no love
She said, ""I like it, that's why I jock it""
Then I said, ""You only on my back because I fill brother's pockets""
Got em drivin Benzes Jeeps and Rolls Royces
Attackin me will leave youth with no voices
The choice is yours not mine hang with me
I'll have you freestyle and bombin graffiti
We can cut it up like like wax
Claimin I cause violence but America was violent before rap, FACT
Chorus: KRS-One
Warner, Elektra, Atlantic equals WEA
Instead of fighting them why don't you go free Mumia
(repeat 2X)
Verse Two: Tuffy, KRS, Hakim
Wild recital, I kicks the vital, like the _Final
Call_ as I watch, Babylon fall
I had to Rush Limbaugh, get that pig with an axe
Tuffy dips to the side, buckin cannons that's phat
Because he censors the uses of the metaphor
You can get the dick bum up
Because it's you that brings the, real horrorcore
Expenditures forgettin, gut from the poor
Why sure!  Back before we were born they sold us out
Yeah Dade Jackson we know what you about
Youse a Slave Mason, not a Free Mason
Before long the Goddess Tiamat through hip-hop you'll be facin
Don't start me, cause I be the, lyricist
At the nineteen ninety-nine millenium party held at Giza
Sayin he's a, fraud, oh my Goddess
Never in your life should you disrespect an artist
Instead, focus your attention on astronomy
And the up and coming, shift in the economy
If you can't do that, then heed the final call
To free Mumia, Abu-Jamal
Hate to be so rough, it could be the White Owls
House niggaz are full of crap, like my Colin Powell
Kickin vowels, is how we relieve the tension
Until we start to bounce white people like suspension (revolution)
You paint the pictures, the black man on the corner
But tell me, who blew up Oklahoma?
The City, ain't no pity, for the beast
It's Hakim that voice from the East
Chorus
Verse Three: KRS, Hakim, Tuffy
Buck buck!  Buck buck buck!
It sound like gunshots but it could be the plot
of a chicken, definition, is what you're missin and
listen to your children instead of dissin em
Senator Dole doesn't understand the young people
Like they be sayin want to, but we be sayin wanna
They gettin dumber every summer as they walk the rope
Maybe because they cannot understand the quotes
Word, in actuality, this Norman Bates mentality
always seems to represent, minus three-sixty percent
For degrees full circle, dead from the purple
rays of the sun I gots melanin so check it
Bag your nuts quick or get sick from being naked
Suspect it, was it a means for the end
For just a few to drive the Benz while you eat the pigskins
Turned you into mannequins, cause the trick of technology
A revelation, revalations
Sensation gives me inspiration of revolution
That's my solution, there will be no sequels
I'm audi hundred forty four thousand with my people
From Caligula to Hitler, now it's Schwartzeneggar
A lust for the violence is the science of their behavior
Who enslaved ya (it's the Devil) but the God of virtuosity
And of the world created, could it be mental sodomy
Got my mind twisted like the blades of fonta leaf
I sit in disbelief as he crawls underneath
the rock cock back the glock, cause I don't trust
the Devil I rebel until Babylon is dust

Yeah... KRS-One bout to wreck the joint
I was seen openin up at the edge of Detroit
where the cops go beyond the laws
where enemies work together by putting they shit on pause
So what does it mean, Assault on Precinct 13?
You are bout to see just what the dirt bring
It's working, that force, I have been searching
Like Lawrence Fishburne when it's time to hurt things
Ethan Hawke, man he face all that
I hold the mic like Ja held the baseball bat
I stay ahead, like a baseball cap
The ways of the world, Kris don't chase all that
[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
[Verse 2]
Well as I walk through the street, my spirit will speak
to those I meet and great from week to week
I am not my handsome beat. I command the speak
As the observer inside the physique
Many rappers try to compete, of course
But they got smashed and trashed in the streets and tossed
Sometimes I think we all just lost
We just flashin and flossin the disasterous cause
We don't even know the one-ness of the only force
Instead of a golden calf, we got a platinum horse
But what did Moses do with the golden calf?
Threw the log at it and it ended in a blast
Master, get on them quick, get on them faster
In the background you frontin, cuz there's nothing but laughter
I tag church like the shirt king
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13
[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up
So crooked cops you backin me up?
[Verse 3]
Wow, what an ending. What a conclusion
They thought they was winning, but they really was losin
He though he was sinnin, but he really was provin
that leadership keeps it moving, steady cruising
Guns up, funds up, from sun up to sun up to sun up
Buck buck buck! Yo, duck duck
We run up, two down, one up
Dope MCs see me and get butterflies in they stomach
Others can't speak, they just shut up
KRS on the come up, liftin Big Pun up. Let me sum up
Dope MCs, wack MCs, thin MCs, fat MCs, commercial MCs, they can't all
get done up
Raise the drum up, breath for breath, I'll rip your lung up
On my trophy wall, I'm nailing your tongue up
KRS-One, you know what it means
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13
[Chorus]
We gettin up outta here, that's what's up. That's what's up
Watch me back up the truck
You livin wit a lot of fear. That's what's up, my gats stay up

[Verse 4]
We gotta start trusting each other right now if we gonna make it
through this night
From Criminal Minded to Spiritual Minded, and even beyond and behind
it, never be afraid to fight
or be the lazy type. Me, I'm the crazy type
I get them clubs so crazy hype
I throw them glasses on that them ladies like
And years later, rock what they babies like
I blaze the light, there me be 8,000,000 ways to die
but there's 16,000,000 ways to fight
So wherever you are... in the crib or your car, in your tank too
KRS-One would like to thank you, right
That's why KRS on the mic
Wishin you peace for the rest of the night
Cuz at the end of the film, you'll see what it mean
Turn up the track for Assault on Precinct 13!

What is a real hip-hop MC?
Is it MTV, is it BET?
Is it five m-i-c's
So the people can see
I mean, how you think you're free
When you act like property?
Tell me, how do you judge an MC when he's rockin
I mean rockin it live, not pickin his cotton
I mean adjustin his clothes, I mean how do you know
Before you come to the show that you're not gettin heated
That you're not gettin cheated
That you ain't come to the club thinkin 'I must've been weeded!'
(Word)
You got to be a educated consumer
Spend your money on MC's cause these rappers'll do ya
Ass they want is your cash, ass, grass, gas in a flick
When you ask for that autograph they ass-dash quick
Beware of the rapper, he talks like it don't matter
He pulls his gat while we bust off the gatler
[ CHORUS ]
This is the ""Sneak Attack""
The ""Edutainment"" style returns like that
Take it off your shelf
Cause all we deal with is knowledge of self, health and wealth
Not Stealth bombers, leather goose bombers
Original hip-hop armor on cd-rom - eh
You got to get with a
21st century philosopher
Representin the religion of hip-hop, sir
Those that oppose are foes and will get rocked - eh
Stopped, eh - I rise like a helicopter
Like Zulu I'll Shaka, crowd
With a beat that's loud
Huh, I'm black and I'm proud - irrelevant
I'm black and intelligent
I teach my kids to watch the education they give em
Cause it's really all about street wisdom
[ CHORUS ]
True hip-hoppers don't bleed
True hip-hoppers don't need
True hip-hoppers don't speed
No time for greed
True hip-hoppers do read
And will lead, not plead
Will sow seeds that breed
Ah-ha that's safer than weed, indeed
True hip-hoppers don't slave
True hip-hoppers don't crave
Silver and gold, we're not amazed
We live f-r-e-e
If you not into lyrics you can't really hear it nor see me
My philosophy keeps it plain and simple
Here it is: the kingdom of hip-hop is within you
Or is it the kingdom of hell that sends you?
I'm ringin a bell within you
You only seek in a cell, that's what sin do
It tells you to put your craft on a menu, a chart
So they can sell you and your art

Yeah I say was cause today I'm above
All the guns, illegal funds, the crews and the drugs
ANY HOOD I walk in, they show me love
They say 'Knowledge Reigns Supreme, WHATTUP CUZ?'
Cops wanna get sit down and get all bud
They wanna think as they drink drink down to the suds
I respect it, but I don't get down with the fuzz
I don't drink with DT's I don't hang with the judge
But truth be truth and I got the proof
Most ministers were straight thugged out in they youth
See if you're over 25 and you never got live
when it was time to ride, you ain't got no heart
But if you're over 26 and you're still in the mix
and your life you ain't fixed, you ain't doin your part
You see them cats on TV, playin the role?
Gassin y'all, them cats be over thirty years old!
Actin all dirty and cold
NONE OF MY CLASSIC ALBUMS they was worthy to hold
I'm concerned with the soul, overstand?
When we was slappin up rappers they was doin the running man
You don't know my style, we be straight gunnin man

From eighty-six, ain't no rapper realer than me

Don't let me have to pull out the Jamaican in me

They don't wanna pay dues - well start gunnin 'em down!

I get busy with La Pluma, detonate the bomb
to make you hibernate sooner, certified luna-tic
My click run deeper than Charlie Tuna
Kahunas, raw for the able key movers
all over the hood like them Crooked I coolers
Bang maneuvers, from Jerz to Vancouver
Back to the Bronx with heartbeats ample looped up
I Blastmast like Kris, funk abyss
like a phone chauvenist with a Roley on the wrist
Sike! I can afford it, less I slaughtered
three platinum niggaz and none of em prerecorded
KRS-One need to be runnin for office
So Butter Pecan Rican -- tell them to get off his

You know what?  I was just downstairs
and I was on my way up here to the studio and
a guy bumped into me and
and he said.. he said, ""Yo Kris!
How is it that you stay in this music?
You know, this rap music ex-specially for SO.. LONG.. SO.. LONG""
I said, ""Well you know years ago I made a deal with the Goddess""
He said, ""The Goddess?""
I said, ""Well yeah, you might know her as God
but I know her as the Goddess""
The universal mother
The mother of everything you see in existance
I ax-ked her for assistance
in lyrical persistance
and she gave it to me, under one condition
She said, ""I'll give you the gift
but use the gift to uplift""
I said, ""Okay mom!""
So I tell you the truth, really
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
but health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
but health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
In the beginning was the word, the word was made flesh
Knowledge K. Reigns R. Supreme S.
Some of us guess while others of us are blessed
Take heed to the word, that I manifest
I manifest the future, the present, followed by the past
Everything in nature, rules by kickin ass
What they tellin me, but yo, you a friend to me
so I'ma tell you the secrets of MC longevity
Secret one: if it ain't fun, you're done
And about your career, huh, well choose another one
If you don't like what you do, you're through
Lesson two: make sure you got a dope crew
Not some crew, that's like an anchor on a shoe
A MAD CREW, that's of some benefit to you
Lesson three, might be contradictory or funny
but MC's should have OTHER WAYS of gettin money
That's to say learn other things beside music
Make money elsewhere, Hip-Hop you won't abuse it
Too many MC's, just emcee
so their longevity, is based on an Uncle Tom
at the record company
Lesson four: sell your image, never sell a record
Image is respected, records come and go
and get collected
Even the records of platinum artists, that used to rip shop
can be bought, for a quarter at the thrift shop
Which brings me to lesson number five, the illusion
has me thinkin, the minute they drop a record
they'll be cruisin, in the Acura
Slow down!  You're still a amateur
What seperates the pro from the amateur is stamina
Not how long you can rhyme, but how long you've been rhymin
changin with the times, and findin yourself
still CLIIIIIIIIIIIIMbin for wealth
Blow for blow, you're still growin, still showin
(all knowin) now that's a pro at it
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
but health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Me nah gon' need nuttin else
but health, wealth, and knowledge of myself
Thank you Mother, I'm out

When I rock so eloquently
Put the beat on and let me
Kill another wack emcee
Can't trust them  never test me
I practice and study
But I'm not in it for the money
But to me they look so funny
You can't test the teacher
The teacher won't reach intact
Through the speaker you're weaker  now sit your ass in the back
My lyrical you hear it  you fear it  you can't get near it
Cause the spirit eat Eric
And Eric your rhymes is wack
Like that, that, right back
Check it out!
Check it like this
Just skills You know you gots to build just skills
*A phone is dialed a man says hello and a woman starts speaking in
Spanish*
You know you gots to build just skills, uh come on get down
Just skills You know we got to build just skills, come on get down
Yeah, uh come on
I got that rip track, flip that, underground rap
When I kick back
Most of what I'm hearin be weak
So I speak through beats and the streets as I teach
I impeach, through speech, each lyric leech I reach
Have a seat in the lecture
Nothin can protect you
Hard is the texture
Of the mic wreckin rock in your sector
Better than ever remember I am no beginner
I like to shout out Eric Skinner
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Yo, we livin in a world of private jets and limousine
The fruit we eatin as we prepare tangerine to nectarine
See everybody livin in the same routine
We need the telephone, and yes, we need the fax machine
You listen to the sound, well I think you know it's me
Now, let me educate you with my concious poetry
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me love, me love, me love, me love, me love it when it's bad
See if you wack rap you ought be steppin out the back
See emcees on the microphone forgettin that they black
See hear them kick the lyrics that are holdin people back
But when you hear the teacher, KRS will find the track
You bound to see the light, and you don't want return back
So listen very closely to the secret scientist
I'm sending this one out to all my inner city kids
Now you supposed to be apostle what you have inside your head
Can make you more reliable, it can make you feel dead
Now listen very closely to the way I say this rhyme
It's the thing called the brain, and the thing called the mind
But I'm outta time
Chorus (scratching on the word ""can""):
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
On the block you just yap a whole lot
About the clothes that you got
Yo, or the gold that you got
Everybody sees all the friends in your Benz, yo, it's fat
But they ain't gettin money like that
Word to my brother Kenny, jealous one envy
The rich are few, while the poor, many
But you got gold cuffs and cars and stuff
You eatin well, but still in the ghetto you dwell
You know it's hot, so you make it known about your glock
To any perpetrator tryin to blow up your spot
You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble
You the hardcore outlaw, criminal, vandal
Burnin emcees like a candle, but you frontin
You ain't got nothin, with your life you gamble
One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives
Nobody on the block tries, cause you claim you got powerful ties
So at the red light you arrive
And to your surprise you get heffed up with just two steak knives
You're terrified, they take your Benz, and what makes things worse
You ain't got gun the first
Chorus

After seven years of rockin'
How do you rate me?
Poorly or greatly?
Everybody seems to be goin' for their's lately
Yo mad heads be needin' money
So listen very close as I conduct this little study
See it's, funny to me, you can watch TV
And give up your life trying to be all you can be
In the Army
Not knowin' your history
You either fight and die or come back home in misery
Yo get with me, I deal with reality
Loosen your mind to the truth, and don't get mad at me
No politican can give you peace
If you trust Jesus, why do you vote for a beast?
Emancipation is long over due
So overcome procrastination
Because freedom is within you
For some reason we think we're free
So we'll never be
Because we haven't recognized slavery
You're still a slave, look at how you behave
Debatin' on where and when and how and what Massa gave
You wanna know how we screwed up from the beginning?
We accepted our opressor's religion
So in the case of slavery it ain't hard
Because it's right in the eyes of THEIR God
Where is our God, the God that represents us?
The God that looks like me, the God that I can trust?
A God of peace and love, not mass hysteria
I don't want a God that blesses America
I could never really vote for the devil
Let me take you to a higher level...
Verse Two:
Title, take the title from the Bible we can get there
Rip the title from off the front of the Bible, God don't live there
Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries
Picture the Pope and the Vatican, laughing and drinking and singing and
Kissing me
I stand with God whether I'm paid or whether I'm cryin' broke
I like to ask these politicans would Jesus vote?
The way we view God is a freakin' shame
Church is to blame
We trust God, but bomb Hussein
We simply lovin' the scripture
Same scripture that whipped 'cha
Sooner it'll hit 'cha
Religion's gettin' richer
With that European version of Christ made into a picture
Our society's gettin' sicker, and sicker, and sicker...
Like liquor, we are God-Intoxicated
Not to the true God, but the one the government created
The same governments tellin' people to vote
I pray to God because the people have lost hope
You either vote for the mumps or the measels
Whether you vote for the lesser of two evils, you vote for evil
Politics and God are not equal
But the education if you don't guard, is really lethal
People have more respect for a holy book
Than they do for a cow on a meat hook
Belivers of Jesus be denouncing Satan on every level
But every Halloween they're dressin' like devils
I pray to you for the light you might give them
Mother make them know that you're livin' with them
You begin them and end them in silence
Frankly, if they knew you, they would understand violence
I pray to you for the Pope and the Vatican
Have mercy Mother, cause I know that you're mad at them
The White Jesus deceived us awhile ago
And Pope Julius the Second paid Michaelangelo
I know this happened in 1519 yet
This is the image we can't seem to forget
Vote for God, don't vote for the Devil
Let me take you to a higher level...

If you don't repeat the actions of your own success
you won't be successful
You gotta know your own formula, your own ingredients
What made you, YOU..
1987 I was at the Latin Quarters
Listenin to Afrika Bambaata give the order
The call of the order was to avoid the slaughter
He said, ""Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya!""
Without a lawyer, he taught The Infinity Lessons
In how hip-hop could be a, many a blessing
And that was great, so in 1988
there was no debate, we had to end the hate
The name of the game was ""Stop the Violence""
and unity, knowledge, and self-reliance
We - started talkin bout Martin and Malcolm
Had these ghetto kids goin, ""Huh, what about him?""
1989, Professor Griff speaks his mind
but his freedom of speech is declined
1990 came with the West coast
East coast, West coast, who is the best coast?
Lookin back now, of COURSE it was bogus
The whole argument was where we lost focus
We got hopeless; not with the lyrics and music
but with hip-hop, and how we used it
Or abused it, you know how the crew get
""You like it cause you choose it""
1991, we opened our eyes
with Human Education Against Lies, we tried
to talk about the state of humanity
But all these others rappers got mad at me
They called me ""Captain Human"", another message was sent
""Self Destruction don't pay the {fuckin} rent""
Remember that?  Nobody wanted conscious rap
It was like - where these ballers at?
Where can they call us at?  All was wack
Hip-Hop culture was fallin flat and that was that
So in 1992, I found my crew
They said, ""Yo Kris, what you wanna do?""
I said, ""Damn - why they wanna get with me?
If I bust they {shit} I'm contradictory.
If I play the bitch role, they take my shoe.
Tell me what the {fuck} am I supposed to do?""
So I did it, don't stop get it get it get it
All of a sudden these critics they wanna spit it
""Kay Are Ess One is con-tra-dic-to-ry""
Just cause I wouldn't let these rappers get with me
{Fuck} that, {fuck} you and {fuck} your pen
If a rapper wanna diss, yo I'd do it again
But I'm makin these ends, and I got my friends
And I really don't wanna have to sit in the pen
So I go back to the philosopher
1993 hip-hop is uhh.. wack
Go back, check the facts
1994, ""Return of the Boom Bap""
It wasn't all about the loot
It was all about Harry Allen Rhythm Cultural Institute
Blowin up, 1995
Conscious rap is still alive
But nobody wanna play it, nobody wanna say it
Nobody okayed it, they'd all rather hate it
1996 it really don't stop
We put together somethin called the Temple of Hip-Hop
Not just DJin, breakin, graf and lyrics
But how hip-hop affects the spirit
""Step Into a World,"" that's what I did
1997 I was raisin my kid
or kids, but I, had to go
Cause New York DJ's changed the flows
to clothes and hoes, but that wasn't me
I'll be damned if I dance for the MTV
So in 1998 I began to debate
Should I go now, or should I really wait?
'99, I moved to L.A. you see
and took a gig with the WB
Started studyin philosophy full-time
To have a full heart, full body, full mind
But you know what the problem is or was?
DJ's don't raise our kids, cuz
they so caught up in the cash and jewels
How they gonna really see a hip-hop school?
How they gonna really see a hip-hop temple?
They don't even wanna play my instrumentals, but
big up Dr. Dre, Snoop, Xzibit
Especially Xzibit, he was there in a minute
Mic Conception, all of them, said
""Yo you need help?  I should call them""
When I was in L.A., I held the crown
Bloods, Crips, they held me down
I could never forget Mad Lion, killer pride
with the gat in the lap in the low-ride
Oh I can't forget, Icy Ice, Lucky Lou
Julio G, that was the crew
Davey D, Ingrid, David Connor
The list goes on and on, let me tell ya
FredWreck, and my man Protest
Much respect, no less
To my spiritual and mental defenders
Big up to L.A., temple members
But in 2000, I seen how I wanted to live
I wasn't no executive
So I picked up the mic and I quit my job
Said to Simone I gotta get with God
She said, ""Don't worry bout these dollars and quarters.
Record companies ain't got nuttin for ya.""
Damn, she took me back to Bam!
Took me back to who I am!
Brought me back to the New York land!
Now I overstand!..
{interviewer}
Now KRS-One, now you've been quoted as saying that
rap is something we do, hip-hop is something you live.
{KRS} Yes!
{interviewer}
Explain that to us please.
{KRS-One}
Well, well, today hip-hop, we are advocating that hip-hop is not,
just a music, it is an attitude, it is an awareness, it is a way
to view the world.  So rap music, is something we do, but HIP-HOP,
is something we live.  And we look at hip-hop, in it's 9 elements;
which is breaking, emceeing, graffiti art, deejaying, beatboxing,
street fashion, street language, street knowledge, and street
entrepenurialism - trade and business.  And uhh, that's where y'know
that's the hip-hop that that that we're about.  We come from the uhh
the root of, of Kool DJ Herc, who originated hip-hop in the early 70's
and then Afrika Bambaata and Zulu Nation (mmhmm)
who instigated something called The Infinity Lessons
and added conciousness to hip-hop, and then Grandmaster Flash
with the invention of the mixer, on to Run-D.M.C. and then myself.
And uhh, we created the ""Stop the Violence"" movement, you may recall
a song, ""Self Destruction"" and and and so on.  All of this, goes to
uhh uhh, the idea of LIVING this culture out and taking responsibility
for how it looks and and acts in society.

Clap your hands everybody  if you got what it takes
Cos I'm KRS and I'm on the mic  and Premier's on The Breaks
Verse 1
If you don't know me by now I doubt you'll ever know me
I never won a Grammy  I won't win a Tony
But I'm not the only MC keepin' it real
When I grab the mic to smash a rapper  girls go ""Illlll!""
Check the time as I rhyme  it's 1995
Whenever I arrive the party gets liver
Flow with the master rhymer, that's to leave behind
The video rapper, you know, the chart climber
Clapper, down goes another rapper
Onto another matter, punch up the data, Blastmaster
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everybody
Call up KRS, I'm guaranteed to rip a party
Flat top, braids, bald heads or natty dread
There once was a story about a man named Jed
But now Jed is dead, all his kids instead
Want to kick rhymes off the top of they head
Word, what go around come around I figure
Now we got white kids callin' themselves niggas
The tables turned as the crosses burned
Remember You Must Learn
About the styles I flip and how wild I get
I go on like a space age rocket ship
You could be a mack, a pimp, hustler or player
But make sure live you is a dope rhyme sayer
Verse 2
This is what you waited all year for
The hardcore, that's what KRS is here for
Big up Grand Wizard Theodore, gettin' ill
If you see then ya saw I'm in your grill with mad skill
MC's can only battle with rhymes that got punchlines
Let's battle to see who headlines
Instead of flow for flow let's go show for show
Toe for toe, yo, you better act like you know
Too many MC's take that word 'emcee' lightly
They can't Move a Crowd, not even slightly
It might be the fact that they express wackness
Let me show ya whose ass is the blackest
I flip a script a little bit, you ride the tip and shit
Too sick to get with it, admit you bit, your style is counterfeit
Now tone it down a bit
My title you will never get, I'm too intelligent
I'll send your family my sentiments, my style is toxic
When I rock and shock and hip hop it unlock your head, I knock it
It split quick from the lyric
Direct hit, perfect fit, you can't get with it
Verse 3
Some MC's don't like the KRS but they must respect him
Cos they know this kid gets all up in they rectum
Slappin' and selectin' em, checkin' em, disrespectin' em
Just deckin' em, deckin' em, deck-in' em
Who in their right mind can mimic a style like mine?
I design rhyme and get mine all the time
MC's standin' on the sidelines, always dissin'
When I roll up and rush their crew they start bitchin'
I don't burn, I don't freeze, yet some MC's
Believe they could tangle with the likes of these
Cross your t's and dot your i's whenever I arrive
Wide, magnified, live like the ocean tide
You dope, you lied, I reside like artefacts
On the wrong side of the tracks, electrified
Comin' around the mountain, you run and hide
Hopin' your defence mechanism can divert my heat-seeking lyricism
As I spark mad iszm
The 1996 lyrical style's what I give 'em

And now that you're on top, they can't borrow from you
That's not hot, tell em how you love bein pop
Cause you was so broke before, sleepin cold on a cot
You don't rock, you grab money
Your crocks rock the spot and you grab them honeys
It's about to get ugly
I don't even go to these bullshit kiddie-ass clubs
You wanna be a thug? Let's thug
First of all, soldiers speak to soldiers
Captains speak to captains
Lieutenant/lieutenant, cool?
But your first mistake is: he's steppin to me, rookie
Like you a O.G. and you just a run-up, fool
Who really got these streets on lock?
Whose name really holds high respect on the block?
Who opened up these clubs and taught you how to mix?
Who opened up these thugs from Compton to the Bricks?
I don't even sound like the rest of you kiddies
I study the ways of God, you studyin titties
And ass, I pity your class
Cause you come out with a blast
But you're trash, so you really don't last
They not HOT, all they do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
They not HOT, all they do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
This is hotter than heat, too deep, I'm on top of the streets
You weak, you ain't really rockin these beats
You ?????, you dress straight, eat straight
But you're a slave, and yo, you can't come up in a heat tank
G-o-d we thank, we watch what we sell
You better hope these Christians are wrong cause you goin to hell
Think about that when you're spittin your raps
And you call out KRS, I'll put you flat on your back
You're not HOT, all you do is talk a lot
That's not HOT, where's your respect on the block?
That's HOT, not cause you're friends with the cops
That's not HOT, a real MC you're not
What's HOT?
(KRS-One)
That's HOT!
What's HOT?
(KRS-One)
That's HOT!
Who's HOT?
(KRS-One)
That's HOT!
Where's your respect on the block?

Yo, my man, how bad do you want it?
You know how many cats I threw the pitch, and they never caught it?
I told them to bring they lyric, but they never brought it
Scared to get ripped off, cheated, deleted, rejected and shorted?
Yo, how bad do you want it?
Fear—I ain't got no time for it
If you want it, yo there's the track—put your rhyme on it!
[Peedo]
This hunger inside of me's unexplainable, Kris
The struggle we put in this box will be put into disc
Birth and ever, these family problems is hurtin'
Both of my sisters is pregnant, fuckin' feel like murkin'
All I have is my word and my balls
And my fam and my music speaks for them all
It's the Dominican animal ready to damage, you puttin'
Pressure to rappers that think they can challenge you, Kris (uh huh)
We been through it all, the grimiest days, this earth ain't
Ready for my brain, comin' to face (word)
Everyone plus everyone
Do you hear me, KRS-One?
[KRS]
Well listen
You grimy and hungry?
But how long you gonn' trust me?
You really down for this cause or just chasin' the money?
I be up in them spots to be hot, so dusty and ugly
Nothin' be funny, it's all dark, nothin' sunny
Can you walk with me? Talk with me? Pop the cork with me?
When we in other cities, will you rep New York with me? (yeah!)
I need respect and honor
Discipline and no drama
How bad you want it, poppa? (with all my…)
[Peedo]
Loyalty is the key to it all (remember)
Get used to my face, we the winners of all
By mi gente, yo I go low to say-ah
Real like them Washington Heights
Niggaz there (say yeah!)
[KRS]
After you rap, will you stab my back? (never)
You gimme a track, will you take that back? (never)
I give the word, yo you bustin' your Gatt? (whatever)
Respect from your crew? They livin' like that? (they better)
This is no game! Why should I make you popular?
You know I'm the philosopha
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you need it?
If you see it, you can believe it, perceive it, retrieve it and flaunt it
How bad do you want, doggone it, there's the track, if you want it
You got to put your rhyme on it!
[Peedo]
How bad do I want it? I'm ready to die like Big
A serious man with blood in my eyes for this
Success doesn't come overnight
It's gonna be dark a while until I see light (that's right!)
What is it?
[KRS]
This is no game, why should I do it?
KRS-One, me and Peedo runnin' through it
I saw you down the street in FedEx
You said you had the beats was comin', like ""I Got Next""
So we went upstairs, my man Choco hooked it up
This is KRS-One—turn my voice up! Wha— (wha-,wha-)
How bad do you want it?
How bad do you see it?
How bad do you hear it?
How bad do you BELIEVE you can be it?
If you doubt, then you're out
If you believe, you can achieve
I got the city on lock, but I'm gonna hand you the Keys like Alicia
You know my style, you know I'm the teacha
Philosopha, minister, emcee, Hiphop's spiritual leader
With the heater
You comin' with me? You runnin' with me?
In the spirit Scott LaRock, JMJ and Pun is with me
Yo, cats be steppin' to me ALL the time
With the rawest rhyme
But two weeks later, they fall to crime
If you listenin' to this song, and you want to be put on
You must be loyal to the cats that made you strong
It could be your friend, your father, you sister, your mother, your brother
or some other
Just remember the days when YOU was under!
Before the Hummer, before the Benz
Before the hundreds, before the fifties, the twenties and tens
When you was thirsty, remember the living water, and who poured it
Now ask yourself, how bad do you want it?

A North Face and skully hat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A army suit, a pair of Timbs don't MAKE YOU A THUG
An ill mug and a gat don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A real thug is a thug that's HUSH!
[KRS-One]
Yo, yo, yo, check it, check it
Let us begin, KRS, winnin again, KRS-One did it again
KRS bigger than them, look at them they bit it again
I think my gun just gonna start clickin again
Click-clack, I always spit back
Anybody call my name I go get that
In fact we draggin 'em out, to a deserted route
The teacher returns, you must learn, the word is out
No doubt highly respected, Front Page Records
Off the hook, yet still connected
Are you teachin yourself, teachin yourself?
I'm like history repeatin itself
""Criminal Minded"", you've been blinded again
Lookin for my style you can't find it again
You can find these others that may sound like Kris
but when it comes to the hands they don't get down like Kris!
They never ran up in the clubs with a hundred thugs
Never had the respect of Crips and Bloods
Never knew B.O., they never knew Big Pun
They never battled MC's, they never bust they gun
They don't know that, all they know is that show DAT
That's Digital Audio Tape if you don't know that
Now go back and get my name correct
'fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck
[Chorus 2X: Nyce]
A doo rag a platinum chain don't MAKE YOU A THUG
A fat ride with chrome don't MAKE YOU A THUG
That tough guy talk don't MAKE YOU A THUG

Yo, yo, yo (hit 'em Kris!)
What mean the world to me?  H-I-P, H-O-P
And S-I-M, O-N-E
And G-O-D, I stay low key
I go down to hell, and slap up Satan
Then return to heaven, where Scott LaRock is waitin
Resurrection, just like my brown complexion
when I speak, I don't need protection from the heat
I walk these streets and I'm quick to hit first
Throw on any beat I'll be quick to spit first
and rip town, I take one look around
And all you hear is, ""Get down, get down, get down!""
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I stay on blast
That's why these rappers want me to go on last
That's the truth, that's the fact, that's the deal
Forget sex appeal, my tech is real
And my rep is real, K-R-S
Woo-woop-woop!  That's the sound of E-M-S
The rag on your head, it best stay white
Cause I can turn that red in a mintue a-ight?
Now go back and get my name correct
'fore I snatch them diamonds from 'round your neck
Once again, get my name correct
'fore I snatch that platinum from 'round your neck

Yeah.. yeah.. yo, yo, yo
To all my heads who wanna see an improvement
in hip-hop culture, join this movement
We need more glocks than my man Freddie Foxxx
The knowledge I spit to the click it don't stop
That hardcore God-core, ready to start war
Rock more shock more top your pop tour
I'm sure I'll drop the grade to zero
When the teacher return, I don't chase DeNiro
Like where yo?  Where yo?  They livin in fear yo

I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
I'm a blunt gettin smoked and I can't wake up
Verse
I'm dreaming about being a blunt
I'm running around and I just can't wake up, Hah!
I'm dreaming about being a blunt. Ho!
I'm walking around and I just cant wake up.
I'm tryin to wake up, I cant wake up
So I run and jump
someone yelled get that blunt.
Get that blunt, now Im thinking this is major
I've got a bunch of people chasing me with a razor
I dont like this dream as a blunt
But I can't get out of it
And I cant seem to wake up
So Im running and racing
Blunt smokers are chasing
This is insane, I'm caught by House Of Pain
I'm picked up
they said they gonna put my head out
They slit my back and all the tobacco fell out
Now I'm hollowed wet thin and yes ready
They poured the shumpang gently and rewet me
Check it out now, in the same attire
here comes the fire
Now they lit it, now Im burning by the minute
But check it out
more heads came to chill
Everlast took a pull and passed me to Cypress Hill
Cypress Hill took a pull
lungs are full, who's next?
I'm being passed to Das Efx
As they took a mad pull, smoke blows in heaps
It's really smokey but I can still see Black Sheep
Woe! Black Sheep gets me, relights me
Room is proper, Im passed off to Shabba
Shabba's voice gets low like a tuba
he said, ""Me no folllow no rumor""
and passed me to Grand Puba
I wasnt burnin right so Puba got mad at me
And said who rolled this
and passed me to Kid Capri
Kid Capri said ""I wont front
pass it to Redman, he knows how to roll a blunt""
Redman said no need to re-roll
and passed me to De La Soul
De La Soul took a hit and kept hittin
now they're buggin cause they passed me to Bill Clinton
Bill Clinton said I'll smoke but I won't inhale
I'll only hit it twice
he got slapped by Greg Nice
Now I fell on the floor, Greg Nice picked me up
I'm a blunt being smoked and I can't wake up
Chorus
Verse
Get me out of this, somebody wake me up
I'm still on fire and Im still being smoked up
half my body is gone, now they're coming to my head
now my head is being pinched by Ted-D-Ted
A crazy nightmare i got to go
I got to wake up and Im passed off to Yo-Yo
Yo-Yo gets respect as a lady
She didnt smoke
She passed me off to Showbiz and A.G.
A.G. said respect due see
he got one big pull and passed me to Smooth B.
Smooth B. although he's talking to Ted-D
took a hit and passed me to Fab 5 Freddy
Freddy said Yo! There's nothing left Pop
Looked at me in my face and passed me to Chubb Rock
Chubb Rock said ""Yo Freddy chill!
If you ever catch me smoking, just kick me in the grill""
Im in the mouth yo! I cant wake up
Yo! Im a blunt getting smoked and I can't wake up

When I rock so eloquently
Put the beat on and let me
Kill another wack emcee
Can't trust them, never test me
I practice and study
But I'm not in it for the money
But to me they look so funny
You can't test the teacher
The teacher won't reach intact
Through the speaker you're weaker, now sit your ass in the back
My lyrical you hear it, you fear it, you can't get near it
Cause the spirit eat Eric
And Eric your rhymes is wack
Like that, that, right back
Check it out!
Check it like this
Just skills  You know you gots to build just skills
*A phone is dialed a man says hello and a woman starts speaking in
Spanish*
You know you gots to build just skills, uh come on get down
Just skills  You know we got to build just skills, come on get down
Yeah, uh come on
I got that rip track, flip that, underground rap
When I kick back
Most of what I'm hearin be weak
So I speak through beats and the streets as I teach
I impeach, through speech, each lyric leech I reach
Have a seat in the lecture
Nothin can protect you
Hard is the texture
Of the mic wreckin rock in your sector
Better than ever remember I am no beginner
I like to shout out Eric Skinner
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Yo, we livin in a world of private jets and limousine
The fruit we eatin as we prepare tangerine to nectarine
See everybody livin in the same routine
We need the telephone, and yes, we need the fax machine
You listen to the sound, well I think you know it's me
Now, let me educate you with my concious poetry
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me love, me love, me love, me love, me love it when it's bad
See if you wack rap you ought be steppin out the back
See emcees on the microphone forgettin that they black
See hear them kick the lyrics that are holdin people back
But when you hear the teacher, KRS will find the track
You bound to see the light, and you don't want return back
So listen very closely to the secret scientist
I'm sending this one out to all my inner city kids
Now you supposed to be apostle what you have inside your head
Can make you more reliable, it can make you feel dead
Now listen very closely to the way I say this rhyme
It's the thing called the brain, and the thing called the mind
But I'm outta time
Chorus (scratching on the word ""can""):
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
On the block you just yap a whole lot
About the clothes that you got
Yo, or the gold that you got
Everybody sees all the friends in your Benz, yo, it's fat
But they ain't gettin money like that
Word to my brother Kenny, jealous one envy
The rich are few, while the poor, many
But you got gold cuffs and cars and stuff
You eatin well, but still in the ghetto you dwell
You know it's hot, so you make it known about your glock
To any perpetrator tryin to blow up your spot
You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble
You the hardcore outlaw, criminal, vandal
Burnin emcees like a candle, but you frontin
You ain't got nothin, with your life you gamble
One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives
Nobody on the block tries, cause you claim you got powerful ties
So at the red light you arrive
And to your surprise you get heffed up with just two steak knives
You're terrified, they take your Benz, and what makes things worse
You ain't got gun the first

It's all a struggle (tryin to make it day to day)
It's all a struggle (from my hood to around your way)
It's all a struggle (single parents all by theyself)
It's all a struggle (diseases decreasin your health)
It's all a struggle (fiends swearin that's they last puff)

(No matter what you do, who you are or where you from)
(Rich poor black white, at the end of the day)
[Verse One: KRS-One]
It's all a struggle - and most people's struggles are doubled
You ain't the only one with a challenge facin some trouble
Look at the woman chewed up by the dog with no muzzle
Or the workers that got trapped underground in that tunnel
Some kids are playin in pools, others in puddles
When they listen to the news the propoganda is subtle
But it's time for you to know that the cryin got to go
Release the guilt that you built and let it flow
Slow and low, that is the tempo
Move slow and on the low, this you gotta know
You don't get the muscles without the hard struggles
You ain't the only one out here tryin to get dough
From the hustler to the preacher to the government leaders
From the airline pilot to the chef to the teachers
We linked in the same huddle, in the same tussle'n'bustle
Cause at the end of the day, it's all a struggle
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: KRS-One]
It's all a struggle - but don't let the challenges bug you
Or the government drug you, or the thieves in the street
beat and mug you - build your tunnel under the rubble
Come up on the other side eye to eye with the trouble
Look at the Twin Towers crumble
Look at the religious leadership stumble, everybody struggles
But not everybody comes through nifty, it's fifty/fifty
The city itself will outrun you quickly
Whether you be healthy or sickly
Whether you be wealthy or thrifty, ugly or pretty
Everybody's tryin to get 50's and 100's
I taught this at UCLA just off Sunset
Now run get ""Ruminations""
It's a book that I published for the healing of this nation
In just a few chapters we run through, some possible solutions
Cause at the end of the day

You see seven acres of land where we can all spaz out
To all my fathers that fathered, hold your head up for starters
Teach your toddlers, not to be thieves and robbers
This that other kind of rap, that leads to true hip-hop
There's other kinds of raps, but they lead you to get shot
The choice is yours, you gettin older now
You got a kid comin, how you gonna hold it down?
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
What's the point if you're gettin locked up?
[repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
It's really time we seperate the young men from the big men
The young girls from the women, whatever the title that fit them
My style designed to open a child's mind when I spit them
I only got a little bit of time to really rhyme and uplift them
You see them brothers talkin about that crime?  Forgive them
It won't be long before they words manifest and they live them
Sometimes you gotta go back to the beginnin to learn
After fifteen years I'm just BEGINNIN to burn
To all my true hip-hoppers, that pay bills and live proper
Never allow a negative thought to stop ya
Correct ya posture, stand upright not uptight
Don't be scared of the light, just prepare for the fight
We say ""Criminal Minded"", cause our thoughts are illegal
We represent the very thinkin of, inner-city people
Real people, people that take care of theyself
They need health, love, awareness and wealth
Not to mention, knowledge of God
Not college, the job then dead - if you agree nod your head
It's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin locked up?
[repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?
C'mon c'mon yo, tonight is it
We gonna steal away together, through these rhymes I spit
When the student is ready, the teacher, shall appear
So I'm here, but are you really ready to face your fears?
Mo' money, mo' money, is that your credo?
You've been livin in a dream world Neo, power to the people!
Nobody's equal, everybody's diversed and different
My lyric'll never cheat you, my verse is gifted
So manifest what you believe is God almighty
It could be Allah Jesus Krishna Buddha Aphrodite
It could be Nefretire come hear me and never fear me
It's like at some point in your life you gonna have to hear me
I represent them teachers preachers comin through your speaker
Manifestin another lesson to them true believers
Instead of pickin up our women ready to mistreat 'em
You better get yourself a wife and kid and never leave 'em
You better teach 'em you better read 'em you better feed 'em
The system will defeat 'em if you don't teach 'em the cops'll beat 'em
The style that I be kickin quick is ""Edutainment""
Hip-Hop culture needed a teacher quick so I became it
Instead of rhymin about my history and what I been through
I'd rather rhyme about awakening the God within you
Yo, it's one thing to be iced out and rocked up
But what's the point if you're gettin locked up?
[repeat 3X]
Know thy self, and thou shalt know
The universe and God (whoa-ohh-ohh)
God is the mother, the father, the friend
Know ye not that ye must be born again?

The word I bring to you today
is Knowledge Reigns Supreme
You got no time to joke and play
cause Knowledge Reigns Supreme
While others play that game for fame
their concepts bring you stress and strain
But blessed are those that know my name
is Knowledge Reigns Supreme
[ VERSE 1 ]
Why do I call myself God when I'm speakin?
People always ask me this question when I'm teachin
What you gotta understand is that Kris don't exist
The only existence is God conciousness
And God consciousness is what exists as Kris
Your ego tells you that you're doin all this
You amidst a mister professional lyricist
I get rid of this forever, it only gets better
Kris from the universe you could never sever
Cause there is no Kris, only the universe, remember
Goin a little deeper you can check me
My whole campaign is about livin life correctly
But don't respect me, respect the universe
Iit's her verse that I disperse
And free you from the curse of the Spaniards
The French, Portuguese and English
Check me as I sing this
Science of mind, I bring this
[ CHORUS ]
[ VERSE 2 ]
I bring you out the cave and change how you behave
Everything you see is really particles and waves
Not to mention your visual extension
Is ruled by perception, guiding your every direction
If you really want money your mentality must switch
If you really wanna be rich you gotta act like you're rich
You can't act like a bitch if you wanna be a lady
You can't get the gravy if you're sittin around lazy
You can't be in the hustle if you ain't lookin for trouble
You can't be single if you know you're really double
You can do it (yeah) we can do it (yes)
You can do it (yeah) we can do it (yes)
We the best, don't worry 'bout the card they dealt ya
It's real, I proceed myself out the shelter
Every day and night seein myself rock the mic
Lyrics tight, gettin paid right for my mental sight
Richer not poorer, expanding my aura
To attract more of positive energy
(What you dealin with? What you tellin me?)
[ CHORUS ]
(Uh
1-2
My man Kris
Flip the style, you do it like this)
[ VERSE 3 ]
How'd you forget it?
The culture that's embedded
Check it, it's energetic
My people really won't be deaded
But Kris won't let it
The same thing that you read I read it
My hair is dreaded
But hip-hop, yes, you must respect it
We must direct it
And use it positively so these sceptics
Can learn our mathematics like metrics
I said it
I'm 'bout to shed it
Why don't you check me like your credit
You still don't get it
You twisted like that ????? Keith Sweat ????
Rappers nowadays sound so pathetic
Yo, let me set it
Although my presentation is ??????
And hypothetic
My genetics is highly poetic
And athletic
But still some don't get it
The paparazzi life is all synthetic
The balancing of the mind is what's authentic
The total body is ultramagnetic
Like that (like that)
We did it like that
Like that (like that)
And we did it like that
Like that (like that)
And we did it like that
Like that (like that)
And we did it like that..
There is no need to be afraid
Open your mind
Do your knowledge
+Do+ your knowledge
Stop studying your knowledge
And +do+ your knowledge
..did it like that
Like that (like that)
We did it like that
We did it like that
We did it like that

whose mouths and things are covered with herpes sores
he brags to the public about how he scores
with 12 year old girls behind convinience stores
his brain is gone from smoking crack
he lost his hair, it won't grow back

Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to do
While they floss with the chi-ching and all the rings
You stay focused, keep doin your thing
You cannot get the diamond ring, if you can't really sing
Or if you haven't got a skill, that you ready to fling
What you bringin to the table if you not really able
Tryin to get to the top, like the Tower of Babel
Back in the days, remember all the old gold cables
Where they at now?  Sold, when they dropped from the label
All the money they gave you made you very unstable
They really enslaved but you wasn't able with the coke in your nasal
to see, you up in the crib but they rockin your cradle
You a joke and you fatal, they made you an M.C.
Meaning: Most Confused
Not E-M-C-E-E, that's what I use
Many people really wanna know from me
when I'ma drop and they can go cop, the next LP
Or CD, or T-A-P-E you see
It's about word of mouth, for me
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
We CRUSH, THEM, and they rap
Yo, they don't really know where the money is at
And what's funny is that, is if you'd just stay focused
they'd be the one to be the brokest!
I'm from the inner city, that's right
Flashy asses and titties that's right
No pity mad graffiti that's right
Broken gang treaties, that's real
I speak complete broken slang freely at will
I spit what I'm about to spit, get what I'm about to get
Never no counterfeit, movin about a bit
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, only a few like the sound of it
Others can't get down with it (ONE.. TWO.. THREE.. BREAK!)
So why did I have to come off my sabbatical?
Battle you?  My metachromatical will splatter you
I got another track to do, I can't mack witchu
Your rhymes are fictional, mine are factual
I'll embarass you, I'm glad to do
I'm the teacher but in the streets it can be bad for you
I feel sad for you, cause you frontin like you gettin ahead
but you really on E instead
I've come to show these people you're not my equal
All you want is the cash and a hoe in a see-through
Yeah; KRS-One comin through with the breeze team
You know how we do
We crush, them, and they click
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to get
You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant
Yo we crush them, and they squad
Let me tell you right now that it's all about God
You can walk around the streets like you livin it hard
But a real teacher know when you scarred
I refuse to be bought, I refuse to snooze
I refuse to come up short, I refuse to lose
I refuse to be caught in the court
I refuse to refuse bein taught, I refuse evil thoughts
Cause they whole {shit's} wack, trap's wack
You're wack, you're pack's wack, in fact I jab-slap that
Cap at that, now, retract that crap, wherever I'm in or at
You better go back and sip that crap
Bring your gat, I'm lovin that
Like football, you'll be, runnin-back
Blazin 'em, merely dazin 'em, barely playin 'em out
These are God's lyrics, I'm just sayin 'em out

You supposed to get free and intelligent
Not a platinum plaque, that's irrelevant

You supposed to be buttoned up right to your neck
If you a woman, you'll get respect
Let me tell you we crush the, and they crew
Let me tell you right now what you supposed to be
You supposed to be a man of integrity
Above the law, you effect destiny

Pick it up, pick it up
You know what time it is when KRS-One comes through
Representing all true hip hop culture
You know how we do
How can they throw you in prison now for long years
If in reality the black man doesn't belong here
Have you forgotten how we got to this place
Why then are all the jails predominantly the black race
If you dont teach me my culture I dont know who I am
I dont know the difference between my enemy and my friend
So I'm robbin and killin I got nothing to live for
You turn my father into a boy my mother into a whore
Now I'm hardcore on the Ave
Watching while people that got me to walk fast
After beatin us, rapin us and robbin us
400 years of that's what's inside of us
Take a look at me now I'm really your creation
A technological anti-human mutation
A mutation of a better way of life
You first pulled the knife but to heal it will take my whole life
I fought no force on this level
I listen to bass and treble
Thinking that the white man is the devil
Cause who could be so cruel like this
So heartless, so senseless
But I'm taught by the devil
To grow up and be a Devil
To do the same devilish things on another level
However when I act out the mission
You turn around and throw me in prison
You a sucker

And putting him in a land he really doesnt understand
Then teach him to respect Greek mythology like
Pythagorus, Ptolomies, Socrates
These people are thieves
They stole us astronomy, mathematics, all tactics of biology
Even the concept of democracy stolen from the king Akhanoton
Put down the book, use your brain
If you dont know who you are you are clinically insane
The board of education cant see that
Well it deserves to get beaten and robbed by black
Give me my frame of mind back
Give me my culture
But you dont understand that cause you a sucker

Soldier floods your mind like Noah
As you get older you've got to pay attention
At how you livin hardcore
You aint a kid anymore grow up, to blow up the spot you're at
Learn the skill and go to the top of that

Masta Ase in the place, you know we know
my man Rican, my man Zorro, taught me how to draw
in the yards of the 5 train and the 4
So when I'm on tour I represent the hardcore
I'm taggin up your blackbook sure, I'm out for the fame
""I'm writin my name, in graffiti on the wall"" (repeat 4X)
* first time, minus ""I'm"" *
Yeah, check it out check it out check it out one time
Hip-hop music in effect one time
[KRS-One]
When I was growin up, I had no butcher baker candlestick maker
I had rubbing alcohol and carbon paper
Yeah, carbon paper and a blackboard eraser
got me chased in the bus yards, with Rican and Nazer
Historically speakin, cause people be dissin
The first graffiti artists in the world were the Egyptians
Writing on the walls, mixing characters with letters
to tell the graphic story about their life, however
today we do the same thing, with how we rap and draw
We call it hardcore, they call it breakin the law
There used to be a time when rap music was illegal
The cops would come and break up every party when they see you
But now the rap music's making money for the corporate
It's acceptable to flaunt it, now everybody's on it
Graffiti isn't corporate so it gets no respect
Hasn't made a billion dollars for some corporation yet, so
in the name of Phase2, Stay High, Pre-streets
Grab your cans and hit the streets, I'm out for fame
""I'm writin my name, in graffiti on the wall"" (repeat 6X)
Yeah, hip-hop culture in the house one time
All graffiti artists in the house one time
Yeah..
Biggin up the other side things here y'all
The visual, not your video (check it out)
[KRS-One]
I'm livin in the city, inner city not a farm
Steady bombin til I get fatigue in my arm
Watchin for the beast cause many artists they shot em
And beat em in the yards, while doin a top to bottom
So pass me a can, not of Old Gold
but full blue, sky blue, watch me unfold
with the cold burner, of names you mighta heard of
like Fab 5 Freddy, Sam Sever
Word to the wise, Futura 2000 recognize
Nation of creation, G Man come alive
Checkin out Revolt and Zephyr
My man Easy, and Rembrandt, Mitch 77
Oh no with the paint we can never dilly-dally
Big up and respect to Con Art in Cali
The Soul Artists, The Rebels, The Rascals, 3YB
United Artists, TAT and Dondi
Yes the other side of hip-hop is representin the visual
Toys we be DISSIN you, I'm out for fame
""I'm writin my name, in graffiti on the wall"" (repeat 10X)
Hip-hop in the house one time

All graffiti artists in the house dig the rhyme

Fresh.. for nineteen-ninety-five

""Boogie Down was performin  hey they ain't no joke""  > Slick Rick
""Down with the sound called B D P""  > KRS *
Verse One:
Back in the days I knew rap would never die
I used to listen to Awesome 2 on WHBI
I used to hear all kind of rap groups before sampling loops
Rappers wore bell bottom Lee suits
Me and Kenny couldn't afford that
So we would go to the park when they was jammin' to hear rap
I used to listen till the cops broke it up
I always thought to myself ""Damn, why they fucked it up?""
But never the less I was in love with the microphone
And it stayed that way until I left home
On the streets of New York, now I'm free
But with freedom comes big responsibility
I used to walk around driven by the force
I remember how large Super Rhymes was when he fell off
I used to wonder about crews that used to rock
They were large, but none of them could manage to stay on top
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Record deal and video outta here?
Mercedes Benz and Range Rover outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!
Verse Two:
After livin' on the streets alone
Some years went by, I signed myself into a group home
I used to watch the show ""I Dream of Jeannie""
And dreamt about ""When will I be large like Whodini?""
But I was messin' with graffiti on the subway
And gettin' chased by the cops almost everyday
I knew it had to bea better way see
So I would go to my room, blast RUN DMC
Around 1984 I left the group home, again alone
Still dreamin' about the microphone
Gimme a chance man, I know I can rock it
But I had to worry about puttin' money in my pocket
So when I reached the shelter I met my helper DJ Scott La Rock
And we both loved hip-hop
I was takin' suckas out in the shelter system
Yeah there was rappers in the shelter but I had to diss 'em
But all along, my vision was never lost
I kept seeing all these rap groups fallin' off
Do you ever think about when you're outta here?
Fly girl and fresh gear outta here?
Five-thousand dollar love seat outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, but we ain't goin' out!
Verse Three:
While I'm battling these rival crews
Yes, BDP would stay in the street news
Some said all they wanna do is battle
They can't write a song, so their careers won't last long
Around this time I used to hang with Ced Gee
And DJ Scott La Rock used to buy gold with Eric B
I didn't meet Rakim till later with Scott
I remember we were jammin' at the rooftop
It used to irk me when these critics had opinions
Scott would say ""Just keep rappin', I'll keep spinnin'""
We had a fucked up contract, but we signed it
And dropped the hip-hop album Criminal Minded
We told the critics your opinions are bull
Same time Eric B and Rakim dropped Paid in Full
Hip-hop pioneers we didn't ask to be
But right then hip-hop changed drastically
People didn't wanna hear the old rap sound
We started samplin' beats by James Brown
In the middle of doin' My Philosophy
Scott was killed and that shit got to me
But knowin' the laws of life and death
I knew his breath, was one with my breath
I had nothin' left and it was scary
So I dropped By All Means Necessary
Another hip-hop group that was a friend of me
Was a revolution crew called Public Enemy
It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
These two albums set off consciousness in rap
But all along, I'm still lookin' around
And all I can see are these rap groups fallin' down
Do you ever think about when you outta here?
Condominium and beach house outta here?
Credit cards and bank accounts outta here?
No doubt BDP is old school, be we ain't goin' out!

Just who got knocked?
Very little givin'
Everybody's heart is locked

Where I can't even find work, with proper employment qualifications

Where everyday is Saturday and 12 months is vacation
Peace, love, unity, havin' fun

When I rock so eloquently
Put the beat on and let me
Kill another wack emcee
Can't trust them, never test me

But to me they look so funny
You can't test the teacher
The teacher won't reach intact
Through the speaker you're weaker, now sit your ass in the back

Cause the spirit eat Eric
And Eric your rhymes is wack

Check it out!
Check it like this

*A phone is dialed a man says hello and a woman starts speaking in
Spanish*
You know you gots to build just skills, uh come on get down
Just skills  You know we got to build just skills, come on get down
Yeah, uh come on
I got that rip track, flip that, underground rap
When I kick back
Most of what I'm hearin be weak
So I speak through beats and the streets as I teach
I impeach, through speech, each lyric leech I reach
Have a seat in the lecture
Nothin can protect you
Hard is the texture
Of the mic wreckin rock in your sector
Better than ever remember I am no beginner
I like to shout out Eric Skinner
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Just skills, you know we gots to build just skills, come on a get down
Yo, we livin in a world of private jets and limousine
The fruit we eatin as we prepare tangerine to nectarine
See everybody livin in the same routine
We need the telephone, and yes, we need the fax machine
You listen to the sound, well I think you know it's me
Now, let me educate you with my concious poetry
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me want, me want, me want, me want, me want no wack rap
Me love, me love, me love, me love, me love it when it's bad
See if you wack rap you ought be steppin out the back
See emcees on the microphone forgettin that they black
See hear them kick the lyrics that are holdin people back
But when you hear the teacher, KRS will find the track
You bound to see the light, and you don't want return back
So listen very closely to the secret scientist
I'm sending this one out to all my inner city kids
Now you supposed to be apostle what you have inside your head
Can make you more reliable, it can make you feel dead
Now listen very closely to the way I say this rhyme
It's the thing called the brain, and the thing called the mind
But I'm outta time
Chorus (scratching on the word ""can""):
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun?
No, you can't cause now you bouts to get done!
Can I tell them that I really never had a gun
Never had a gun, never had a gun?
On the block you just yap a whole lot
About the clothes that you got
Yo, or the gold that you got
Everybody sees all the friends in your Benz, yo, it's fat
But they ain't gettin money like that
Word to my brother Kenny, jealous one envy
The rich are few, while the poor, many
But you got gold cuffs and cars and stuff
You eatin well, but still in the ghetto you dwell
You know it's hot, so you make it known about your glock
To any perpetrator tryin to blow up your spot
You grab the microphone and talk a good ramble
You the hardcore outlaw, criminal, vandal
Burnin emcees like a candle, but you frontin
You ain't got nothin, with your life you gamble
One day you gamble up snake eyes
Talkin all that junk about you don't take dives, you take lives
Nobody on the block tries, cause you claim you got powerful ties
So at the red light you arrive
And to your surprise you get heffed up with just two steak knives
You're terrified, they take your Benz, and what makes things worse
You ain't got gun the first

Yeah, yeah
Y'all don't really know about the KRS rap
Y'all don't really about why we stay trapped
Y'all don't really know hip-hop ain't rap
But let me tell you how we can get it all back
First realize givin up is wack
Say to yourself I can never be wack
Then realize that we must go back
And the reason you can't seem to get on track
is you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
And how I get down and move around
I've already been to the proving ground
In conscious rap, who rule the sound
The question is are you down?
[Chorus] w/ minor variations
[KRS-One]
Look - KRS-One, I've learned already
Everything they doin is temporary
No matter how big you live
You still the creation of a music executive
And when you get old no matter what you did
They throw you away and they pimp your kid
Yeah kids, on the TV whylin
You know why we got racial profilin?
Cause you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, all y'all know my name
So there in the future we'll look back
And then we will see we were under attack
But it'll be too late, the loss'll be too great
You'll see, just wait!
[Chorus] w/ minor variations
[KRS-One]
C'mon, c'mon, yeah c'mon
You see how they shuttin down KRS-One
Cause I'm not sexy, thuggin or dumb
Ask yourself -
- why they only promotin criminal activity and nothin else?
On the videos and on the radio
Teachin our kids which way to go
And the way that they tell our kids to go
If you listen, heads right straight to prison
While you, keep, buying, HOES, simple and plain
You, keep, buying, HOES, y'all better peep the game
You got to release that temptation
Get a brand new affirmation
Your life is what you make 'em
Peace, salaam alaikum

There is no ocean like the one, within
Look to the moon rise with the tides, and swim
(repeat 4X)

Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
KRS-One, coming through.. like this
Uh-huh, do it, do it like that, like that
Uh, uh-huh
[Saul Williams] * sings first two lines *
Saul the road to Damascus, come follow me
The serpent swallow the moon, but it won't, swallow me
(Yeah, speak the word!)
Intellect is like a major city
Laden with concrete, metal
Advanced modes of transportation
Shining buildings, and fenced in parks
Spirit is the mountain's forest wilderness
and vast countryside that surrounds it
Too many people live in the city
Struggling day to day for mere existance
Most have forgotten how to live off the land
They only experience nature on class trips
and short-term vacations
For those that live in the country
Cities are like amusement parks with high prices
and temporal satisfaction
At the end of the day, they are tired
and ready to go home, and relieve their ringing ears
[Saul Williams] * singing *
There is no ocean like the one, within
Look to the moon rise with the tides, and swim
(repeat 2X)
[KRS-One]
Uh-huh, speak the word
Hyper-accelerated meditations talk
The reversal of this word dispersal is thought
There is no difference between thought and talk
like the blackboard chalk and homicide chalk
they both give outlines
One is designed to outline the mind
The other outlines the body after a crime
Could it be that these two chalks are connected;
meaning the body gets outlined when the mind is neglected --
-- or poorly directed
Like the teacher with the chalk
Or is the teacher the beginning of the homicide we talk?
Be selective in your speech
Cause the chalk of the two technical teaching has taught each
Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone
Nearly every daughter, nearly every son
Ignorance reigns supreme for some
They chase the sum, inviting the I-R-S to come
Make the connection, choose your direction
Use your protection when sexin AND hexin
Things come back cause they really never left
If the secret to meditation is found in the breath
then speech is another form of meditativeness
Whattya say to this latest rhyme or poem?
Some have been known to quite the mind through

Every dollar that we get, we be earning it
Yo, you never have to worry about me taking a trip
Or leaving you at home so I can quickly forget
Yo, with me it's the opposite, you swerve the jeep
You the queen of your house, you earn your keep

A little boy trying to pay theirs cell phones and pagers
But with me you living with the savior
We be up in the temple of hip-hop, or chilling with the mayor
I thank the creator
We don't need what they handing out
This is what your man is about
It's like peace and much love
Trust and respect
Your friends may have diamonds but they aint get that yet
They may have the burghettes and cars and private jets
But all they're really good for is sex
{Chorus}
We be hanging out late night at denys
Having conversations about every and any
Many people want what we got
A relationship that just keeps getting hot like hip-hop
You know I'm not the regular guy
You know I can't be compared
You know when the drama comes I aint scared
My name rings bells in the street
You can say my name in any hood your protection is complete
Thugs be right on their feet
Saying ?What, your man is Kris??
You don't worry miss
{Chorus}
But most of the time you're with me and the kids
Mind at ease, chilling out at Chucky Cheese's
These are my kids, I know what their need is
I know what the doctor bill in school to which in fee is
My daughter, I know who she is
And all my sons know exactly what being free is
{Chorus}
No, you might not get the drop-top three
But all your kids want to be like me
Their father, and even when times is getting harder
There's only one name you could trust, Kris Parker

""These are the streets!
Shit is real out here!
This ain't no fuckin joke!""
I lived in a spot called Millbrooke Projects
The original Criminal Minded rap topic
With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young gifted and black  you got no rights
Your only true right  is a right to a fight
and not a fair fight  I wake up wonderin who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
and went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin at the party
Brothers lookin at me like they wanna kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
and wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin inside, yeah from the out
it seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Every single day I hear lie after lie
Like ""Black people don't die, we multiply""
So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
The sacred street art of keepin it real
Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
But all I really got is hip-hop and a glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
to meet other beasts, lookin for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
""Yo yo there he go, him,"" there's the dinner
White meat, carryin a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like Mother Africa, white meat is violated
We quickly dissapear, like Santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
We say, ""peace/piece"" cause that's what we really want
A piece of the pie that America flaunts
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
""Oh shit!""
The truth is that police must serve and protect
REALITY is black youth is shown no respect
The truth is government has a war against drugs
REALITY is government is ruled by thugs
With all this technology, above and under
Humanity still hunts down one another
Rappers display artistic cannibalism
through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
Through basic animal instincts, we think
So the battle for mental territory is glory, end of story

That'll send a message to all them sellouts
House nigga rapper, your bottom done fell out
You don't even know how
I told you I wasn't talkin about you then, but I'm talkin about you now!
Blaow! one to the kness, blaow one goes right through
Even St. Louis don't like you!!!!

First of all, I don't know WHO, y'all saw on this stage before me (aight)
I don't know WHO, y'all gonna see on this stage after me (true)
But THIS, is REAL.. HIP.. HOP!  Worrrrrd UP!
I'm gonna find out tonight, where the real hip-hop

{*scratching: ""KRS, come get up in they asses""*}
[Verse One]
You ain't Fo'Reel and you ain't Universal
Your whole style sounds like a infomercial
You ignoramus, I'm the baddest with the mic apparatus
Challengin the God of rap is madness, I'll snatch your status
With these elders lookin at Billboard you could stop them
But I got enough albums to make my OWN top ten!
You limited, like the spread of traffic
You bite my style off the radio
so when you speak in fact I hear the static
You better Chillout like Chuck, I kick like three Norrises
One of my sixteen bar rhymes is eight of your choruses
Of course it is, ridiculous
Watch out, I be in the club inconspicuous
Gotcha, on your, hands and knees
Ain't it about time for some real MC's?

Yo yo, Beatminerz, turn up the track a little bit
Gonna do this right now
[Verse Two]
Remix it, don't re-fix it
First brigade, second brigade - all swords lifted
Formation, classified information
Code red rhyme style accurate articulation
Don't test my foreign relation
The cats in Brixton, Birmingham and London just waitin
Got my cats in France like ill
Even Africa's laughin at'cha right along with Brazil
The West Indies?  Jus' wan fi kill
Got Canada mad at'cha, Germany heard of me, they seen the skill
Hip-Hop is more than a thrill to us
A dollar bill to us, believe you will trust in that
Cause if you bust at me, on TV, CD
Internet trust that, I WILL BUST BACK
I turn down heat real quick, when I spit
you need the medicine what I speak is so sick
Then again these veteran be better than many men
Forever we hit 'em again better than ANY trend they could ever say
In any season, hot warm cold or freezin
When it comes to MCin, we believe in rhymin for a different reason
No frontin, my rhyme style tells you somethin
They rhyme style tells you who they freakin
But you was already told - what does it profit a man
to gain the whole world and lose his soul?

On Technics sets, he wrecks, collects a fee next
While you rejects practice, suffix and prefix

Ridin one day in a '92 Beamer
After seven years I seen Denise she still a skeezer
But look what she did, she went and had a kid -- no dad
And just released her ass out the rehab
You think she'd act like she don't know
She's still a hoe, but umm check my man for the show
""Hiiiii, DJ K-R-S""
She tried to shake her butt, I rolled my window up!
She got pissed and said, ""You ain't all that!""
And went and got some other girl schemin for crack
In my car, I couldn't hear what they spoke about
I hit the ac-celerator and I was out!
I never check my man but I knew the plan
Come to the jam MC's in there be thinkin they Superman
Sure enough, the place is packed with no breeze
Crazy girls -- and wall to wall MC's
I'm like a cat these MC's are Fancy Feast
I'm thinkin of rhymes but I'm interrupted by Denise
She said, ""Kris I really need a favor honey
My girlfriend here really needs some quick money!""
I looked at her girlfriend and her girlfriend was fly
But I ain't stupid, she had that LOOK in her eye
I touched her back, she said, ""Denise has he got the crack?
Is he the one? I gotta run back and feed my son""
I said, ""How old is your son?"" She said, ""Three months""
I walked away but my man cold bust her fronts
So she pulled out a gun and shot him in the party
Except for the MC's, I knew EVERYBODY
She tried to let off a shot, one more time
But got stomped so bad, she turned to wine
No one could find Denise for several weeks
You know the time, on this '93 beat
The girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I knew a group that had a dope lead singer
Swinger, single guy, that knew his style was fly
After the show he was tired sweaty and kinda sloppy
But of course, a million girls are in the lobby!
He saw a group of girls hangin out and lookin good
So he took one to his room because he knew he could
Inside the room he said, ""Make love to me and never stop""
She said, ""Sure, but how's about a crack rock?""
I knew my man down the hall had it all
So he called, down the hall, but homeboy wasn't there at all
He turned to the girl and said, ""My man ain't there""
So she let down her hair, unzipped his pants down right there
Oral sex in effect, or rather deep throat
But just before he came she bit his dick and slit his throat
As he fell back dizzy, he began to choke
She took his wallet and said, ""You ain't broke!""
The girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
I said the girlies is FREEE-EEE, cause the crack cost money, oh yeah!
* DJ Premier cuts n scratches ""Oh yeahhh!"" *
Yes Premier you know you rule hip-hop, an'
yes Ced Gee you know you run hip-hop, an'
yes Kenny bwoy you run hip-hop, an'

When I'm Brooklyn, we rulin HIP-HOP!

Over in Brazil yes we rulin HIP-HOP!
Over in Germany we rulin hip-hop
But in New York, we rulin y'all tonight badda-bye-bye-bye
In New York, we rulin y'all to-NIGHT!
We come to rock you whether you black or you white

Superior people use superior skill
We can defeat any congressional bill at will
The hip hop nation will prevail
all problems in society with inner city philosophy
The hip hop in me must come out or die to lock in me  no doubt
Executed properly
I bigin to shout out  splat out approximately
three single syllable words per second
like I am God  you are God, we are God, forget it
Time to sell it in a lyrical battle, I'll never jet it
Like a shot to ya head I'm embedded in your mind
With constant conscience lyrical rhyme
At the end of time, I'll be in my prime
Read the sign, men, rhymin
like an oratorical shymin
I look still but I'm climbin
Newsflash here's the latest findin
Ya whole environment created in ya mind and in ya heart
Hip-hop displays art
The highest level of mental expression, play your part
Hook:
I'm the intelligent wise on the mic (x3)
Everybody knows
All these motherfuckers tryin to be large
with their two car garage just like El DeBarge
It's played out, fadin out, over
Talk to ya broker, time to give back that Range Rover, soldier!
I told ya woe onto the hip-hop perpetrator
Wholesome like a neighbour stealin all ya flavour
Danger danger ya better rearrange ya thinkin
Check what you eatin and drinkin, ya breath is stinkin
with the stench of a snitch with information, leakin
linkin up with the enemies of Kris speakin
But I'm already in 1999
feelin fine while most MCs will be out of sight and outta mind
Rewind cos I got a little bit of time
Negativity will be wiped out by pain after turpentine
I find my rhymes combines mobility, creativity
positivity, purger of sensibility
to a wide vicinity, engulfin your facility
O silly me, killin me I begin to see your stupidity
I rock way hard you can't get wit me
or go wit me or float wit me
Frankly, this is wrong, people, poetry
Forget ya little off-the-head rhyme
It's way past your bedtime, for the tenth time
forget tryin ta get mine
I went from the park with my arc in the dark
A simple spark, the little Park sparked now I'm in ya heart
Everytime you think I'm comin one way, I come another way
If you ain't got no fly rhymes, say today
Run away, run away, run away....little boy
Like the TAT crew I terrorise your toys
Noise is what I hear
when you shout your rhyme into the atmosphere
The blast master's here!
Hook (x2)
Now which motherfucker wants their title tooken, defended
I see my schedule it's open-ended
I can move somethin around like ya booty ass sound, beginner
What happened? You couldn't be an Apollo Amatuer Night winner?
Now the teacher you retrudge
Don't you know I am that lyrical gate keeper
You'll get railed like the sleeper
No peep tha, no peep mine, no peep this hard style
that keeps the party floatin like a foetus, meanwhile
you hold your head, you can't belive this godchild
This *?sins?* recommend ya and because you're not fertile
or fertile {pronounced ""fertil""}
Your reflex's slow like a turtle
Yeah my picture you circle from papers and journals
Without rehearsal, *?mic is first all?* is the worst

Into a million children

Willing and start illing, comin thru the ceiling
Enough of this reteric let's start building

Yo turn me up just a bit, so I can hear it and spit
Reverse spit, and get tips, rehearse a hit and take tricks
Research the art just a bit, don't let me start I won't quit
But if I start I'ma flip, just like I'm startin the whip
Puttin the key into it, mentally seein it
G.O.D. believin in it, I get a fee when I spit
C-L-U-B's I just rip, I'm lyrically well equipped
Over the beats and the mix, I keep the streets in a fit
When it comes to lyrical spit, I'm the t'cha of it
Higher consciousness, truth, I'll be reachin for it
Metaphysics, here's an example cause I'm speakin of it
Put your hands in the air, but you must be aware
That even if your hands are down, ain't they still in the air?
I be takin you all the way down the road, takin you there
I'm livin and givin just a smidgen of what I share
The style that I'm kickin, lyric lickings from over there
We rockin forever, we get better with every year
With letters and intercessors I sever every fear
Lookin here, like UPS KRS takes it there
Let's make it clear, thought waves go through the air
You can act like you busy or you dizzy or you don't care
But listen here, everybody got a fear
An insecurity, some type of thing they gotta clear
So that's when I, reappear, from the rear
Philsopher, follow the bright light to right here
I might wear, light gear
Appear when you least expect it, tellin you now how to fight fear
With faith, you hear the bass, well clear the waste
You gotta get the negative cats out your face
Get that irrelevant crap out your space
Conceive it believe it decree it achieve it with HASTE!
[Chorus]
Nuttin in the world is impossible
Listen to the shit that I drop on you
KRS-One, philosophical
Believe and achieve what you got to do
[Verse Two: KRS-One]
We rawwwwwwwwwk, we don't stop
Hip-Hooooooooop, we don't stop
Tick-tooooooock, we don't stop
We at the top we never drop cause true hip-hop is so hot
Some people thuggin, some be pimpin, I be teachin a lot
I be teachin about the meaning of a deeper hip-hop
That don't make me any better than a thief or a cop
All I know is when I flow, the people be shocked
You don't really want the teacher to come step on your block
With my whole glock takin everything that you've got
I'm a different type of deeper intellectual rock
For when you really wanna compete and get up off your block
You are not just doin hip-hop, you +ARE+ hip-hop
Like if you have a badge and a gun, you ARE the cop
Like if you practice medicine, you ARE the doc
You just forgot rappers rap about cars a lot
And the magazines worry about stars a lot
But I'm the sun and they avoid me BECAUSE I'm hot
The orthodox hip-hop is sure to rock
With or without a video, I'm leavin 'em all in shock, OHH!

We've been having these gatherings for over 12 years
Uhh, my first one, was ah at Latin Quarters in 1987
with Afrika Bambaataa - he threw the first one, that I attended
We kept the tradition going through the Stop the Violence Movement
Through Human Education Against Lies, Rhythm Cultural Institute
And now the Temple of Hip-Hop
This is Hip-Hop's spiritual base
And as a spiritual base, we look to guide the youth in that discipline
Uhh, no culture is a culture, unless it has principles
unless it has morals, unless - we are unified
in some sort of principle, something we are not going to step beyond
Something that defines us
What I'd like to do, is just for a moment as we.. deal with this
Think about your role in Hip-Hop
Think about what you do everyday in Hip-Hop
This is not about right now
It's about twenty years from now
It's about ten years from now
The tapes are rolling, the notes are being taken
This is the type of thinking we have to get into

Which means they new to the tracks
Which means they do hold us back

They can't see today how they effect tomorrow
Too afraid to follow, cause they trust is hollow
Because according to the laws they'll harp some sorrow

Why you preach so much?  Why you speak and such?
Why you so bent on reachin each of us?""

Have a seat then with us and start speakin with us
They'll be critiquin us to be sure they believe in us
We don't need a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix it
We live non-toxic, we teach that hip-hop is
the transformation of all subjects and objects
Retrain your optics, to reinterpret the topics
We gotta stop treatin hip-hop like a product
and more of a strategy; I got graphs, charts
sacred textbooks, these cats can't battle me
But they try, and why?  Cause that's a PROBLEM..
PROBLEM IN HIP-HOP TODAY!
We gotta fix that
These cats need history to get with me
But hip-hop's history's a mystery
So how they gonna find out, trial and error
We can make one the example for all to get better

""These are the streets!

I lived in a spot called Millbrooke Projects
The original Criminal Minded rap topic
With twenty cents in my pocket I saw the light
If you're young gifted and black, you got no rights
Your only true right, is a right to a fight
and not a fair fight, I wake up wonderin who died last night
Everyone and everything is at war
Makin my poetic expression hardcore
I ain't afraid to say it, and many can't get with it
At times in my life, I was a welfare recipient
I ate the free cheese, while the church said believe
and went to school everyday, like a god damn fool
Well anyway, here I am, chillin at the party
Brothers lookin at me like they wanna kill somebody
A cypher manifested in the center of the jam
I got to show these wack rappers really who I am
It's me against them, so I clear the phlegm
and wage the war, hardcore to the end
For someone lookin inside, yeah from the out
it seems like disrespect is what rap is all about
But hip-hop as a culture, is really what we give it
But sometimes the culture contradicts how we live it
Cause every black kid lives two and three lives
The city's a jungle, only the strong will survive
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Every single day I hear lie after lie
Like ""Black people don't die, we multiply""
So when I kick a rhyme I represent how I feel
The sacred street art of keepin it real
Why I gotta listen, to somebody else?
How they got wealth, let me talk about myself
But all I really got is hip-hop and a glock
The results are obvious, if I'm confined to my block
Occasionally, in the city I'm released
to meet other beasts, lookin for the feast
We grunt and growl, on the prowl, as the air gets thinner
""Yo yo there he go, him,"" there's the dinner
White meat, carryin a bag of some sort
Life is short, white meat is quickly caught
A scuffle a muffle yet none of us hesitated
Like Mother Africa, white meat is violated
We quickly dissapear, like Santa's little elves
And go into a area to fight amongst ourselves
We say, ""peace/piece"" cause that's what we really want
A piece of the pie that America flaunts
Reality, ain't always the truth
Rhymes Equal Actual Life, In The Youth
Reality, ain't always the truth

""Oh shit!""
The truth is that police must serve and protect
REALITY is black youth is shown no respect
The truth is government has a war against drugs
REALITY is government is ruled by thugs
With all this technology, above and under
Humanity still hunts down one another

through lyricism, we fight each other over rhythm
Through basic animal instincts, we think

Biggety buttah shit is how we comin kid we runnin shit
Now who you fuckin with is Diggey Das EFX'n
We flexin, cause kid we got this rhyme and took effect y'all
[Books]
Aiyyo I figgety flow I rocket blow a nigga out the socket
Keep in mind to keep the dread, now they like my pocket, watch it
It's the rhyme fiend about a second from the crime scene
The boogie banger twisted off the lime green
Fuck a dime we, strictly fifty, the BDP and Hit Squad committee
King of my city, ask my cousin Smitty, yo
Got to get the dough, got to blow the spot
Diggity Das KRS East coast on lock
Verse Two: Das-EFX, KRS
[Drayz]
To corny niggaz y'all get ate, my shit'll make you faint
So much platinum on my walls that I can hardly see the fuckin paint
You think it ain't before a year and stopped recordin
Now look we comin back and runnin shit like fuckin Michael Jordan
Accordin, to my niggaz in the sewer
Yo you a, corny nigga so we gots ta do ya
[Books]
This for my niggaz on the block, handlin rock like Kenny Anderson
I'm brandishin, stiggedy styles to keep MC's vanishing
Scattering, fuck it, styles don't be mattering
My pattern's amazing son Blazing like a Saddle and
Battling's a no-no, got more Fame than Coco
I'm paid and still drips ya with a blade from my logo
So take your, style and Go-Go like D.C. niggaz
Y'all know the haps we movin strapped on the East nigga
[Drayz]
Yo, yo, well miggedy mayday, mayday, it's Crazy Drayz's payday

But wait a, minute, cause we get in it for the masses
For classes, yo KRS come get up in they asses
[KRS]
What... I say, follow me follow me
with my syllable syllable lyrical criminal
MC threats are minimal to my phsyical they just
whittle and whittle away, with little and little to say
As they piddle and paddle away, they say OK
But I chop that ass up anyway
What's your handle I got mad MC heads upon a mantle
I got genuine MC skin sandals
I light the mic up like a candle, watch it melt
Cause when I felt lyrics you both are screamin for help
when you hear it, you can't bear it, you can't even wear it
You oughts to just cheer it, go get it spirit!!
As I fa-la-la-la-la, I'm comin with that rara
Rockin mics when you was googoo gaga to your momma
You wanted to battle KRS when you was young you told your poppa
He slapped you in your head and said UHH-UHH
But you didn't heed the warning
Now I'm in the place, now I'm your face
Lookin at your crew but they all broke out
because they nothin but lace
KRS is like mace, in your motherfuckin face
Yo DJ Dice, tear down the place!!

It's a demo, it's a demo, it's a demo, it's a demo
Steppin out the limo, KRS-One, gettin in you
From the get-go kiddo throw em out the window
flip em like a nickel
Peep the hottest single
He'll sink them like the S.S. Minnow
That same kid that rocks the Benz rocks the Pinto
Watch my signal, I rock the rap game like Nintendo
Hey diddle, diddle, get played now like a fiddle
I watch you wiggle, in front of the audience that was fickle
Now you can't make a nickle, the sour pickle you are
KRS-One, ninety-seven superstar
I got one thing to say and let me make this clear
Everywhere, now throw your hands in the air
The real hip-hop, is over here

Huff now that's the Blastmaster connects, the larynx
to a high-tech mic set, you get what you get
Tech and Sway, index of singles is complex
On Technics sets, he wrecks, collects a fee next
While you rejects practice, suffix and prefix
Hip-Hop I reads it, and mark your album incompleted
I seen it, saw it, back in eighty-five
Platinum rappers yo that can't rock live
Their mental facilities, lack the ability
for lyric agility -- battle?  You're killin me

The real hip-hop, is over there
The real hip-hop, is over here

Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Throw your hands in the air (get loose now)
Aiyyo I'm breakin, in this rap thing, I've been waitin
Ready for the world, rude like awakening
Homo sapien, ? ? rock every stadium
Scholars and players, here to Las Vegas
Embrace the papers, land of money makers
Brothers hate us cause the brothers ain't us
Yo yo, from coast to coast I'ma overdose you and BDP you
and Kris-Kross your mind, wouldn't wanna be you
A Uptown thing, world premier
Throw your hands in the air baby it's on
How many MC's wanna get they rep torn?
From Joe to Cage and mics in my juvenile days, I abuse
The mic get lifted, the crowd gets amused
I got next.. you lose!

Give me relief! Squash all beef!
Don't let these arguments destroy us!

All beef can be squashed if you want it
But instead of forgiveness  ego you flaunt it
Everybody gets into two or three quarrels
Leadin to a squabble, someone will die tomorrow
Life is not a thing you can borrow
All beefs don't have to lead to sorrow
will ya, go out tomorrow
I think, you should think about the beef you got
And confront your enemy before it gets too hot
Never feel ashamed, to say, ""Yo G I'm sorry
I apologize,"" the object is to stay alive

If I ruled the schools, from pole to pole
the entire judicial system would fold
I would get rid of the books cause they bogus
and in school, Knowledge of Self would be the focus
Kids would flock to the schools like locusts
Cause school now relates to them, and you would notice
violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields
Petty crimes times petty crimes
equals prison for lifetimes
The universe divided by two
equals me and you
Me and you, go into the universe once
or as one united front
But listen up, when I was growin up in hip-hoppin

Only a few hear my voice in they ears

But what if I told you I could read the future
and in the future, they the losers
We the winners, cause they the sinners
Well it's all mathematics, can I eat my dinner

Drop that bassline...
You want lyrics?  We give ya lyrics.  Check it out now, one time...
(Do it, do it, do it...)
When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!
Gal!  Will ya come slap dem up
When we come in all de dance 'nuff D.J.'s shut up, woy!
Ill Will, slap dem up
Verse
~~~~~
[Ill Will]
MC's get ate, get broken like a pretzel
and get dissed if they ever try to step to
They can't take a MC with loose lips
Talk a lotta shit [but sink no motherfuckin' ships]
Lyrics make bigger holes than hollow tips
Watch another rapper body get stiff
Just like in church, we pass the basket
as I preach over his casket
Fuck it, kick the body right over
and say ""See ya, hmm...nice to know ya""
Got another rapper to see
Yo Kris, bust that ass [certainly]
[KRS-One]
If you're shiverin' get off the pot
Let the original rapper rock the spot
You stand there and jock, goin' [mumbles]
This is absolutely ludicrous, what can you do to Kris
Chattin' foolishness, step along quick with that stupidness
It's me rippin' this for self, where else ya lookin'?
I got more rhymes than all the Jamaicans in Brooklyn
So beat it or be seated, Gee I'm mad undefeated
Young boy, you can't see me, run along and make pee-pee
I was rockin' rhymes when ""La-Di-Da-Di"" was a demo
Admit you been on my tip for years and just can't seem to let go
Go, go call your mother, tell her you wanna battle KRS quick
I bet the minute you get home you'll get your ass whipped
Crazy ill mad styles is what I give'em
Not a run-of-the-mill'em, I drill'em, I got ridiculous rhythm
None of my styles you can get with'em
Still um, will um, your crew come get some so I can kill'em
[Ill Will]
Well I roll by myself but don't let it fool ya
If I got beef my crew'll damn step to ya
We don't play no games, I'll come straight to your rest
Lift up your shirt and blast you in your chest
[Well that was fresh]
[KRS-One]
A fad doesn't fill the bill, but mad skills will
Don't let me have to kill you kid, god forbid still
Greed will lead your need to succeed
but your speed, your speech
Your outreach is a breach of what I teach
For lyrical styles you're a leech
If I was Spanish I'd say, [""You lie like a beech""]
Wow-wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow, wow-wow-wow...
Wow, for a amateur you really looked hard
But you're really a bitch, when you get it together
call me, here's my card
Check the list: you lack breath control, mental behaviour
Lyrical talent, imagination and flavour
I got no time for amateur rhyme, you could be hurt
Thinkin' you're hard because you wear a gangsta T-Shirt
I'll smash your wanna-be ass in the deep dirt
Black, you'll come up dizzy sayin' ""How da fuck he do dat?""
'cause you're yappin' like you can't be reached
If your name ain't Arrested Development, well save your speech
Time to ill, I got mad skills to fill
Not a fake, I got more styles than Drake's got Tasty Cakes
Gotta be the best Gee, don't try to test me
You'll get jacked son, even if your name is not Jesse
Let's be up front when I meet ya
Peace, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' teacher

The real killers, chillin in the Whi.. I mean the not RIGHT house
Want me to be they lab white mouse
The smile of seedy greedies, deprivin the needies, breakin treaties
Overseas wildin while they profilin on the TV's
Some of 'em cool though.. see I like that nigga Bill
Hittin everything in town, and he got that smile down
Now let's break down the meaning of a smile
Is it happiness and blissfulness, well let's go down the list
You got the real deal for real-real smile
You got the phony they don't know me let me hide my feel smile
The dumb embarassed smile
The ooh she look delicious, yo that girl is lavish smile (uh-huh)
Then you got the shake your head nah black, that shit was whack smile
The across the bar, yeah it's cool, we can hit the sack smile
The crack smile, the caught in the act smile
The over my shoulder caught you schemin on me delayed react smile
The smile you're really glad to see when it comes round
The spot's hot, they got you boxed in, it's bout to go down
You glance back, your man who packs that once in a while
gives you the - oh I'm strapped, do your thing, baby I got your back smile

Pretend, to be your friend
Smilin faces, show no traces
Of the evil, that lurks within

Whaddya think I joke? Whaddya think I sniff coke?
Me a wild t'ing like Tone Loc, you better be dope
When the soundclash erupt, rev up, step up to the cut
Whassup? I show up to blow up and leave the spot TO' UP
You know what? I'ma go nut, but you know what? Yeah, so what!
It's the regular, when you checkin the, one that perfected the
Smilin faced people posin as your equal
Knowin they wanna beat you defeat you and eat you, but they greet you
with peace and love, not with the piece but the dove
Not beneath but above, now the cheek give a hug
Snug, no grudge, 'til you turn your back and learn the facts
Called learnin truth, the tree is only KNOWN by its fruits
These smilin faces, in many places, sometime they racist
Sometime they sexist, sometime they want your Lexus
Sometime they be your family members remember
Oh no not my lady, oh no not my fella, with them you thought
you'd never ever sever, but they was two-faced - it happens
With a whole 'nother agenda but clever to say whatever forever
Let me make this relationship better, if you real stay real
Be real, the truth we got to treasure, not these
[Chorus]
[Shock G] And they be lurkin
[KRS] You know what's up, ha!
[KRS] KRS-One, Shock Gigga!
[Shock G] That's me baby
[KRS] HA HA.. word
[Shock G]
Yo, just let the beat breathe
Uhh.. yeah..
Cause they be lurkin
Never trust a big butt and a smile baby

People are blessed when I walk in the room
Snakes(?) don't stop me, and if they did

Doctors wanna talk music and whatever's topical
It's all logical, I perform the impossible
Through words I put hip-hop in you; listen

Defeat the flesh, defeat the beast in you and I
Win or lose I never shout, believe in yourself and never doubt
Discipline is simply a better route

Everybody can't be a queen, everybody can't be a ho and a bitch (Ha ha)
Everybody can't b e a philosopher
Some of y'all gotta load up the clip
Word up, watch this
It goes 1, 2, 3 we the best
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, as you can see, or KRS
You don't wanna test the team, why get a vest
You don't wanna be cursed in a verse, by the blessed
KRS with the sound for the eat and the west
Follow no, follow no, follow no, follow no beast on a quest
Somebody gotta be fresh
Somebody gotta be wack
Somebody gotta be the Mc
Somebody gotta do the rap
Somebody gotta be smart
Somebody gotta do that
Somebody gotta do art
Somebody gotta be black
Somebody gotta have heart
Somebody gotta be white
Somebody gotta do their part

Somebody gotta be having their sex in a lex for the hell of it
Somebody gotta be intelligent

Somebody gotta go all the way
Somebody gotta go a little bit
Somebody got to be an idiot
Somebody gotta be belligerent
Somebody gotta be hip hop
Cause somebody else is living it
Somebody gotta be spitting it
Somebody gotta be ignorant
Somebody gotta be holy
But somebody gotta have sin in it
Somebody gotta be losing it
Somebody gotta be winning it
Somebody gotta be flippin' the style I'm kicking just a little bit
Somebody gotta be into it
Somebody gotta be out of it
Somebody gotta be up for it
Somebody gotta be doubtin' it
Somebody gotta be running it
Somebody gotta be all that
Somebody don't even known that
Somebody gotta come right here
Somebody else gotta go back
Somebody gotta be scheming
Somebody gotta be a witness
Somebody gotta be seeing in the meaning is different
Somebody else gotta be somebody, for some else to be somebody
Somebody else to run into to wealth, to try to create one body
One aim, one GOD, one destiny
I'm not non-violent, you can back up off of me
I sip my tea, and cock back three
One for Tiny Tim, Mr.Walt, and Evil Dee
I hope you all see, the need for unity
I'll never stop speaking about Marcus Garvey
Kwame Ture or Malcolm X all day
Black leadership today is all play
Y'all play, y'all immature black behavior
IS worse than being a trader
Do on to others, as you would have done do to your neighbor
Big up to my philosophy majors
Free Mumia Abu-Jamal from the cages
We writes the pages and teach all ages
Justice, tell me what we want now
Justice, for Mumia Abu-Jamal
Or justice for Amado Dialo
Justice, there is no peace without (*Justice*)
All dem mercy, now watch this
I sing, 1,2,3 we the best

Woop-woop!
That's the sound of da police!
Woop-woop!
That's the sound of the beast!
Verse One:
Stand clear!  Don man a-talk
You can't stand where I stand, you can't walk where I walk
Watch out!  We run New York
Police man come, we bust him out the park
I know this for a fact, you don't like how I act
You claim I'm sellin' crack
But you be doin' that
I'd rather say ""see ya""
Cause I would never be ya
Be a officer?  You WICKED overseer!
Ya hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour
First show a little respect, change your behavior
Change your attitude, change your plan
There could never really be justice on stolen land
Are you really for peace and equality?
Or when my car is hooked up, you know you wanna follow me
Your laws are minimal
Cause you won't even think about lookin' at the real criminal
This has got to cease
Cause we be getting HYPED to the sound of da police!
Chorus
Verse Two:
Now here's a likkle truth
Open up your eye
While you're checking out the boom-bap, check the exercise
Take the word ""overseer,"" like a sample
Repeat it very quickly in a crew for example
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Overseer
Officer, Officer, Officer, Officer!
Yeah, officer from overseer
You need a little clarity?
Check the similarity!
The overseer rode around the plantation
The officer is off patroling all the nation
The overseer could stop you what you're doing
The officer will pull you over just when he's pursuing
The overseer had the right to get ill
And if you fought back, the overseer had the right to kill
The officer has the right to arrest
And if you fight back they put a hole in your chest!
(Woop!) They both ride horses
After 400 years, I've _got_ no choices!
The police them have a little gun
So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one
(Woop-woop!) I hear it all day
Just so they can run the light and be upon their way
Chorus
Verse Three:
Check out the message in a rough stylee
The real criminals are the C-O-P
You check for undercover and the one PD
But just a mere Black man, them want check me
Them check out me car for it shine like the sun
But them jealous or them vexed cause them can't afford one
Black people still slaves up til today
But the Black police officer nah see it that way
Him want a salary
Him want it
So he put on a badge and kill people for it
My grandfather had to deal with the cops
My great-grandfather dealt with the cops
My GREAT grandfather had to deal with the cops
And then my great, great, great, great... when it's gonna stop?!

Raw rhymes for raw times
My albums are underground, but this blessing is all mine
And when it's tour time, we open more minds
You need to rethink who you think is the ""Greatest of All Time""
I got this -- I'm raw like Freddie Foxxx is
Hardcore like The LOX is, Scott LaRock is where Tupac is
Where hip-hop is, Digital-ly Underground like Shock is
Oh yes -- I know where the top is
But I'd rather rhyme about how crooked some of these cops is
My synopsis ain't pretty
I'd stay, off them plains and, out the city if I were you
Do what you gotta do
But while you wave them flags, remember Amadou .. Diallo
Here's what we gotta do, follow
I'll put hip-hop in you if you're hollow
Those that already filled, STILL take swallows
Goin over potholes with Tahoes
You don't think +I+ know?  Huh!  I'm lookin at you right now
You ain't dancin in the club, you in your car, sittin down
You in the crib, on the low
You got them headsets on the go
You just saw me at the show - oh you don't know?
It's the Temple of Hip-Hop, comin, with a whole DIFFERENT flow
Yo where them hoes at?  I don't know
But wherever God at, I'ma go
I give 'em a hard rap AND a flow
That's why when they call back for the show, with no video
We get up and go!

Peep it out while I tell ya like this
In every single hood in the WORLD I'm called Kris
It's the, truth for ya, it's the proof for ya
My Cristal passes more bars than lawyers
The underground sound, this is not easily found
You don't need no rings to be down
This is, past the platinum and gold
We already had 'em, it's old
Here's the truth if it be told, gather 'round
Philosopher style is known to be wild
If you only holdin them guns, who's holdin your child?
You got to be thinkin you KNOW that you shrinkin
When the art of Navigation has been reduced to a Lincoln
Change the dial!  I was free then and I'm free now
You free, runnin to MTV?  I don't see how!
You know the real from the fake, you know they stealin they cake
You know it ain't about the art, it's all about what they make
You know the radio's late, you know they play what you hate
That's why you got that Kay Slay tape, tryin to escape
You know the love of the cars and the rims
Tattooed arms and Timbs, are also called sins
You know you got to pay for these spins
You know the rap magazines be wack from beginning to the end
BO!
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
I never was a king and I'm not the Pres
I'm a teacher like that reefer goin straight to your head
I'm a preacher tryin to bring my people back from the dead
I'm a leader tryin to keep you all away from the feds
You my sister I'll be tryin to get you OUT of the bed
I'm a philospher sayin what has GOT to be said
I don't FILL you with lead, I bring that KNOWLEDGE instead
FOLLOW this dread, I'll take you from A to Zed
Who am I?  Just a scholar called K-R-S
You can spend your money on others but THEY AIN'T BLESSED
You can spend your money drugs and STILL BE STRESSED
Look around for conscious rappes yo there AIN'T NONE LEFT
I'm holdin it down; better yet I'm holdin up
Waitin for some young buck to come and sip from the cup
And continue with the menu puttin new knowledge in you
I got a question and a lesson cause I KNOW what you been through

Why they do this?  Ha - yo, yo
[KRS-One]
I climb up the back of rappers
Reach over they head, and rap backwards at 'em
Excuse me madam, I used to throw these uzis at 'em
But I'm a teacher, skills I truly have 'em
These clubs I duly pack 'em
Potential lawyers engineers and doctors, I do attract 'em
Go to your professors and ask 'em
if the songs of the ""Edutainment"" in college they didn't blast 'em
Yes - I'm that ancient one
I set the framework for today's rappers to make they funds
But no you don't know me son
My facial features matches the Sphinx with it's nose redone
You know how many clubs we done rocked?
You know how many guns we done popped?
You know how many funds we done dropped?
You know how many ones we done got?
We been gettin live since the days of Chubb Rock
We know how to survive; these other cats
be in at nine o'clock then be out at five, uhh
We doin the overtime, on stage I over-rhyme
Makin these whack rappers tow the line
Steppin to me, I know you blind; cause your whole flow
your show, your style, you know it's all mine!
The first time you learned to spit
It was either me, Kane, Rakim or Slick Rick!
{*water splashes*}
Welcome to the ""KRStyle""
This year I had to switch styles and bust off two miss-iles
And that's not all, rappers have the gall
To pray and pray for my downfall - but still in all
I have X amount of lyrics to get 'em all
Live at the club I spit 'em all
Rappers backstage lookin sad and piti-fal
Cause they know I'm the pinna-cle and they mini-mal
I spit the metaphysical, the spiritual
The oracle, the lyrical, the oratorical
Rookie!  I'll mop the floor witcho'
I'm the lyrical foundation to all your flows
All your clothes, all your shows and I'm not alone
You wouldn't even know how to hold the mic or the phone
You couldn't even bite on the bone
While we was rockin mics out in Rome
Now you hyped cause you grown?
You know we internationally known, the people love it
But what they learnin bout is on the whole, look above it
But let us get back to what we call hip-hop
Before you whack rappers went pop

It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
It's not natural                If it goes against God
It's not factual                Gimme the truth!
Listen to the lyric as the negative is shrinkin
It's shrinkin out your life when you decide to change your thinkin
One of the first things we gotta switch around of course
Is Jesus Christ, and him dying on the cross
You're looking at the cross, surrounded in it's mystery
With Jesus on the cross in a, total misery
Now seperate Jesus from the cross so you can see
The truth about the cross, and the cross's history
The cross was created by the Roman government
It's only purpose and use, is cap-i-tal punishment
But Jesus Christ, was all about the revolution
While the cross was used as Jesus Christ's execution
See what if Jesus Christ, was hung upon a tree
Upon every church wall, that's exactly what you'd see
If Jesus Christ, was shot in the head with no respect
We'd all have little gold guns around our neck
If Jesus Christ was killed in electic chair, now get it
You'd be knealing to the electric chair with Jesus, still in it
You gaze upon the cross, and you see the execution
You yell stop the violence but the cross you're still using
It's not natural                If it goes against God
It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
It's not natural                If it goes against God
It's not factual                Gimme the truth!
So I say listen, listen, open up your third eye vision
God is not down with religion
Religion they be sellin it, listen up, God is intelligent
Reading of the bible is irrelevant
You gotta look within yourself, not a scripture
KRS-One comes to rearrange the God picture
If you sit and believe, you can acheive
If you sit and accept, you don't know, what's correct
or incorrect, take for instance Adam and Eve
The first two people on the planet, or so you believe
Their first time in heaven kids they had, Cain and Abel
Huh, now let me show you why the story's unstable
According to the story, according to what you believe
There was only Cain, Abel, Adam, and Eve
on the whole planet, now use your intellect
and tell me, what did Cain and Abel do for sex?
Upon the whole planet there was not another
Could it be for sex, heh, they were looking at each other?
Hold up!  I thought the church wasn't into that
But wait, still yet, there is another fact
How did the world get populated?
Now tell me if I'm wrong, but obviously Eve had it goin on
Think for a minute, I know it gets notorious
But yo G, check out the chorus
It's not natural                If it goes against God
It's not factual                Her truth is not hard
It's not natural                If it goes against God
It's not factual                Gimme the truth!

If I ruled the schools, from pole to pole
the entire judicial system would fold
I would get rid of the books cause they bogus
and in school, Knowledge of Self would be the focus
Kids would flock to the schools like locusts
Cause school now relates to them, and you would notice
violence in society would be a minimal
Cause the education yeah, would now be metaphysical
Not livin by laws, but livin by principal
If you disobey, the UNIVERSE gets with you
We would study giving so no one would steal
And we would read each other's magnetic fields
Petty crimes times petty crimes
equals prison for lifetimes
The universe divided by two
equals me and you
Me and you, go into the universe once
or as one united front
But listen up, when I was growin up in hip-hoppin
we had a thing called Jailhouse Boxin
That's why I'm STILL here rockin

Cause we lookin and lookin and don't see that real in them
Cars we be wheelin them, minds we be healin them

So who's up? (Akbar) You live hip-hop?
Yo, get on the mic and show 'em what you got

This whole rap game is a gamble, some MC's can't handle
Financial freeze, your record company's at a standstill

Find fertile minds and drop seeds by the handful
Man you ain't gotta hit me in my head with the anvil
I grow wise, I recognize the lies and the scandal
Once you sign on that line, your career could depend on
these white collar crooks who cook the books like Enron
So I took an oath to speak no lie
While mad rappers die over beef like E. Coli
I guess you thugs won't get the picture until them slugs hit ya
I ain't a hater, but sooner or later ""Love's Gonna Get 'Cha""
And if you don't know that, then you dumb fella
And everything I said, went right over your head, like an umbrella

Categorize me with the best clique, rhyme majestic

Nightmares of lost time haunt taunt me to rhyme
Been isolated, waitin years to finally reappear
Cheers I made it, all praise due, Inebriated
These words are weaponry, huh, mental telepathy
Rocks for definite, reppin it, 'til the death of me
Pain left in me runs deep, and leaks through the speakers
In Jeeps and tape decks, then connects to your peeps
We keep it, thorough borough to borough, city to ghetto
Rock like, heavy mental on the, instrumental
So who's up? (Illin') You live hip-hop?

So focused on my grind, I'm potent when I rhyme
Tell niggaz close your fuckin mouth and open up your mind

I'm aggressive, progressive, words young ticker be vital
Rip the game and the name to reclaim any taken title
Directly hand out stares to the needle as it rotates
An agent to decrepit from rigormortis in flow eighths
Not even for a minute can you rap
Let down by the sound that drowns the clowns even dare to step
Don't ride the rhythm, I order you to jock
Your claim to fame was holdin down but you can't hold cock
Damn right we can fight, I stay with grudge
with no prior budge from the previous
And when is it that fourth'll crack cranium, kids come in the picture
Knowin that asshole and Ion and you ain't the perfect mixture
Like Alice, diners become the impeccable haven
That any enter my zone must be stripped down and shaven
I stand before you as a fiendish critter
Creatin causin collision with a pen
Written that hatred of spaced-out squashed men like it was a sin

I descend to lend a friend a helping hand
to stop a trend, again and again and again, I just can't say when
I beg to confess my sins to other men
Reverands guard lips, within there I'll begin
I'll always win, over-sakin
The party is ripped, without a hit or with a hit I'm rippin shit
You must admit, I'll never quit the lyrics I flip
I'm tough like licorice, battlin Kid Capri?  It's ridiculous
We come to the party inconspicuous..

Yo, time to do what we gotta do
These days, livin ain't true, but I ain't mad at you
I don't got time for the stress and the nonsense
So I try to stay blessed, but it's all tense
When I awake, feel the sun on my right side
It make me wanna grab a gun and change my lifestyle
But it only goes so far, so live it up
Or realize what you know star, and give it up
Or either switch it up, gotta keep reppin on

Now see I'm livin just to die without most any reason
So I keep on chasin paper 'til it's time to go
But should I really go for mine and put the clip all in the 9
Or stay at the 9 to 5 a day I just don't know
But a brother got a daughter I gotta support her
Caught up in the system inside a order, man I can't afford
a kitted Escalade, or bling bling
And so I gotta keep survivin, is the song that I keep singin
I try to keep my head off the floor, the country's goin to war
While Bush is givin dough to NASA and ain't feedin the poor
But I keep love over these beats, these beats keep me alive

[KRS-One]
Yeah, once again, word up urban inspirational
KRS-One, Professor Ecks, whattup Dan?  Woo
Temple of Hip-Hop, let's do it
By the sound of the track, you know who is back
It's the teacher, philosopher of conscious rap
Rappers tired of me sayin where hip-hop is at
Cause they know they unoriginal, copycats
Watch me bump this gospel rap, never wack
In fact, I tell you where the tracks is at
TV is wack, they wanna show us beatin Iraq
When the question is, is where is Chandra Levy at?
[Professor Ecks]
Murdered God and left for dead like hip-hop
And admit to Condit like conduct, to kill Ecks the dread
And Kris crucified the false prophet
John F. Kennedy to these MC's, I draw and cock it
Cock on cocky cops for the love of the art
Punish the part, partition
Pardon the pause, poison pens penetrate the mental
I walk with Kris so my body's a temple
Body instrumentals and body your squad in the body of a God
[KRS-One]
Just think, just think, what if Malcolm X returned
or Dr. King returned, tell me what have we learned?
As we takin our turn, tell me what have we earned
or is the ice and the cars our only concern
Mo' money, mo' money, you be yellin it out
And on TV can't you see you be sellin us out
So in 2010, look to 2002
Who you think they gonna respect, me or you?
[Professor Ecks]
Behold, the God, in the form of the man
Walkin off water and (?) flesh absorbs in the sand
Moor gets the land, divorcin the clan, I'm off into sand
Off and I'm slayin delicate arms from porcelain hands
Slaughtered the lambs, charge it to the game
Cats take hip-hop's name in vain
Disrespectin the forefathers who came (uh-huh)
Goddess hurt 'em right now, like when Marvin was slain
[KRS-One]
They don't want it, nope, they don't need it, nope
Just stay weeded and hope, I don't read what you wrote
Best believe they ain't dope, they deceivin these folks
with they meaningless quotes, I got my feet on they throat
What they speak is a joke, they really weak and they broke
Have a seat and take notes, on the streets I'm the Pope
MTV is they hope, they repeat what they wrote
I'm an MC that won't, let them tempt me with coke
[Professor Ecks]
Nope, flesh of my flesh, blessed by KRS
Used to love her, they (?) haven't made a date with death
Follow no man, enslave the Ecks, Professin the student
I vibe with the teacher obliged to drop (?) liver than heaters
Lyrics liable to eat us like the survivors of Jesus
Now the, blind is the leaders, your styles is egregious
Gets now the brow beateth to underground emceeth
The game is overheated, overweeded, and misunderstood
[KRS-One]
Word, just a ride in they boat, with a platinum rope
No doubt, they sellin us out, what's happenin loc?
Quit this rappin I won't, cause MC'n is dope
If I can't do it for the love then do it I won't
How many times we note when these rappers is dope
Satisfied, that's why I'm renewin your hope
Broaden your scope, when cleaned out your mind
my rhyme is like a new bar of deoderant soap
[Professor Ecks]
In this land of men mice and mimes, I holds right for the laws
Live life like Christ, makin bread from mics and applause
The snakes fight with Tyson like jaws for what's rightfully yours
I might (?) 'em all, tell me - is it life or it's war?

Y'all don't know?  Y'all don't know your body is a temple?

All my sisters out there, here's the truth
You, a you've got to.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Look, look!
You don't want no unsteady relationships, you want it tight
You don't want no man beggin and always gonna get, am I right?
You don't want no man sleepin cheatin freakin behind his wife
There's no such thing as make love, it's really make life
I don't care what nobody say; you sleep with a man, that's your husband
So make sure, before you lay down, you love him
And learn him, yes it's still sacred to be a virgin
Relax, it's curiosity that always burns 'em in fact
Sex is like candy, be disciplined, no splurgin
You don't want your stomach hurtin
Girl, you gotta.. {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Listen!
Cash is an issue with that he can never diss you
Even if he makes you cry, you bought your own tissue
witcha own case, witcha own hand, wipe ya own face
And throw him out, no doubt, out of your own place
If your heart is broken you can mend it
If you're independent, your womanhood, that's when you defend it
Just.. uhh, just {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} woo!
Look!
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Don't come witcha hand always out
If he buys you somethin thank him, but that's not what a man is about
Real men are real friends, showin their real commitment
He tells you he really loves you, a boy can't really admit it
If a man really wants you, that man really flaunts you
In public or private a real man really supports you
'Member what Guru taught you?  Of course you ""Royalty""
You dress how you like when a QUEEN is what you ought to be
and ought to act like, and also ought to manifest
How you dress makes you constantly blessed, or constantly stressed
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME} Yo!
{TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}
Yo, yo
So while you burnin off those calories, think about reality
Get a skill for the salary, a man for the family
Not a boy, that's a catastrophe, don't get mad at me
Instead of always clubbin visit museums and art galleries
Pick the single man, admirin the ancient sculpture
He's cultured, chances are he won't insult ya
Give him your number only after you know what he does
Ask him what it is, not what it was
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the good life (GOOD LIFE)
You want the, you want the, you want the
C'mon, you gotta {TAKE.. YOUR.. TIME}

Many waved flags, and traffic came to a complete standstill.
On the rooftop of City Hall, which faces Daily Plaza, a
police sharpshooter watched the crowd, even as he saluted

{Ain't no need in all the tears, oh no no, yeah yeah
Yeah cause things will be better tomorrow}
[Chorus: repeat 2X *sung*]
No need for tears, no need to cry
No matter what we face, we shall get by
When the problems you face are too much to bear
Know I'll be there
[KRS-One]
Hold that head up y'all, don't get fed up y'all
C'mon let's get up y'all
Make that bed up y'all, life is a set-up y'all
Sadness comes from a lack of knowin, not knowin
where the one that you love is goin
We all gonna reap what we all are sewin
There is no death, just constant growin
We can't stay here forever
We all gotta go to a place we believe is better
So why be sad, why be mad
Now you can see it ain't about the cheddar
It's all about the time that we spend together
Not the rhyme or the crime or the Gucci sweater
The house that's built on a rock can stand the weather
Faith, can stand the weather
But is your house, upon the rock
Or is it on sand and about to drop
Here is the question that you got to ask
Do I live for today or do I live for the past?
Think fast, but do not hurry
Life is a class and we should not worry
But tell me, how long you gonna ignore
Tell me how long you gonna ignore God's law?
How long can you really endure
Livin like pimps, livin like whores
The choice is yours, or really ours
Think about this while you lay the flowers
on the grave, uh, let's talk about how you behave, uh
Do you come out the neighb' or out the cave?
Better change your ways, we comin up on some stranger days
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
Uhh, uhh
Don't step where the danger lays or danger lies
Open them EYES UP, better to RISE UP, WISE UP
Raise your MINDS UP
Look to the left, look to the right
Pray in the day and the night
Be prepared for the fight, not scared of the fight
He's the way, the truth AND the light
J to the E to the S to the U to the S
You can remove the stress
Yes, we do need you here
Yes, we wanna be free from fear
Yes, we wanna start seein clear
Havin you here, not over there
Lookin around sayin where, does anybody care?
Yeah, I'll be there
At the door, not at the war
At Matthew 5:44
""But I say, unto you
Love your enemies, bless them that curse you
Do good to them that hate you
And pray for them which despitefully use you
and persecute you""
This goes for them terrorists too
But them publicans, done put themSELVES up above again
Lookin for blood again, hate no love again
Got them soldiers runnin in, with a gun again
With a ton of sin, in a holy war, how we gonna win?
I think it's time for KRS-One again
[Chorus] - repeat 2X

The time is now, you gotta make your choice
Which side are you on?  Turn now to Matthew 5:46
""For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye?
Do not even the publicans the same?
And if ye salute your breddern only, what do ye more than others
do not even the publicans so?  Be ye therefore perfect;

When the devil got your soul, and you ain't got control
You know you Born Again, but you feel like you old
You put your mind on Christ, or put your mind on Kris
For everlasting life, you must listen to this
Now you could get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll go with this, yo Christians where you at?
Oh yes it's KRS, with Church of the Harvest
With Clarence {?}, hip-hop's winning evangelist
And then there's Hezekiah, his fire brings the fire
He's takin it higher, tell 'em {THE DEVIL IS A LIAR}
I know, you thinkin bout that Y2K
And I see, this fear that makes you lose your way
But we got, somethin that is bigger than Benz
And we stand, upon the rock that cannot break

Through millineiums, God has always opened the door

When you get older and you realise you need it
That's when you retrieve it, now class be seated
This Boogie Down lingo is produced by Domingo
Wild styles I bring you, now go re-write your single
My last name should be Kringle for the gift
On the drummachine I program songs like Steve Smith
Don't Rif, Kin, you're not loud
you're not listening, I self-create my position
Any room I enter I transform to a church
Before you see through battle you should do some research
For we break

-Able to leave sucker MC's in a single rhyme-
Break-over, take-over, total make-over
When I rap it slabs a flack on your Range Rover
You's a joke clown plus you broke down
Like a coat of a cardigan KRS-One be flowing at your party
Your whole crew jetting they be seriously threating
My lyric weapon be upsetting the jamsession
Gather round now for a very important lesson
KRS-One is not the one you should be testing
No guessing, we follow strict mathematics
Temple tactics and word magic
So step up if you wanna get hurt
All year around our shows be worth
The force I observe lifts up your skirt
Leave your space cabin Captain Kirk covered in dirt

-Has more rhymes than a train has tracks-

Rhymes with a passion, KRS-One, broadcasting
Never crashing cos I'm never speeding
You should be heading, what do you trick and I be reading
Leading the new school, with new rules for new fools
Flash styles and young MC's it makes they crews drool
Some say you cruel when I bust off like a new tool
Making a man you do as I drop two jewels
Positive and negative, mutualist disadditive, but I'm not giving it
The Godess is my relative, knowledge I be living it
I creep with it, come to elect ya and you'll witness it
Lyrics I'll be flicking it
Don't step this way if you begin in it
Push your hands up if you've been in it
Let me now get into it, straight rhymes hit the innercit'
When it splatter they say ""Damn, those rappers""
Switching ya, fixing a glitch in ya
Pulling the bitch in ya out, taking a bum a ridiculour route

You think you got what it takes? (Yeah that's easy!)
Huh, we gon' see.. we gon' see right now (Now what?)
Look
[KRS-One]
So you wanna be a conscious rapper
Can you handle the press and they negative chatter
Can you eat cold platters, and still spit data
Watchin others spit lies and they pockets get fatter
Can you climb up the ladder, and reach the top?
But it still doesn't matter, cause you ain't pop
Can you rock for the love of the art
Can you drop hit after hit after hit and still don't chart?
Can you REALLY stay loyal to God
when your life is full of strife, plus it always seems so hard
Can you handle the criticism
People holdin you up to higher standards, but they don't live 'em?
Can you hear these kiddy flows and laugh at it
But when you spit they callin you arrogant?
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', let's do it!

Think you can do what I do
Think you can step in my shoes
You have no clue what I go through
You never felt my pain
When they attack my name
All because I have spoken the truth
[KRS-One]
To be a conscious rapper ain't a mystery
You gotta laugh when they call you contradictory
The whole industry, you gotta push and pull it
To really get with me, you gotta dodge they bullets
Blaow, blaow, blaow, every day and every way
You critics got somethin to say
At the same time, you gotta uphold Christ
Uphold life, while others flash cars and ice
It could break you down, take you down, make you frown
It could actually shake your ground
But if you love who you are, and believe in that
Best believe you will BE where the teacher's at
And where's that?  In fact, in cold or heat
Yes, I declare victory over the streets
Overstand, over these beats, over the so-called elite
Over the strong, over the weak
I know how to speak, and most of all I know how to eat
I know I want humble and meek
So you better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to pop your Cris', uhh
[Chorus]
[KRS-One]
Look!
So you thinkin about bein a concious MC
Well you gotta love God and you got to live free
You got to see the life that others can't see
You got to be the person that others can't be
You can't be a S-L-A, V-E
If you sayin to yourself, ""This may be me""
Then you know goin in that you work against sin
Your very skills will kill the demons within
So don't expect respect from slaves and hoes
Nor the slavemaster's video shows
Nor the rap mags, you know how it go
Especially black mags, you know they don't know
Just go to the crowd that you know will need you
Cause NOTHING compares to the respect of the people
That's what you look for, that's what you work with
Cause anything else, is truly worthless
You better think about that before you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris'
You better think about that, 'fore you rock to this
Sometimes it's easier to just pop your Cris', uhh

Like a piss on the streets I exist
Not the meat but the fish
Complete the feat when I'm speakin the heat into this
Witness Kris rippin this
Don't trip on this, skip ahead if you're ready
My show medley is deadly
I'm about a hundred million mic years away
These players I don't hate, but I'm not here to play
I hit it all day, all night, all afternoon
Rock all mics from the days of sassoon
Where the hell was you?  On the corner with rats
when we was at the LQ, lockin it down and that was that
Divine speaker, mind keeper, time teacher, time leader
I'll be sittin in the club by the speaker
Waitin for you rappers to choke up then I eat ya
like some prehistoric winged creature, AHHH!
On your neck, like the American eagle facin East and West
I be the best, Blastmaster KRS cause

Its time for me to get on and represent the Bronx
so lets set this shit off like this
Uhh  now check it

so like Bartles & James thank you for your support
it's time for all this chit chat to skit skat
arent you tired of hearin ple ple ple ple pla
rase the level of your listenen pleasure a letter
and let the teacher put these new jacks under pleasure
my first name is hip hop no doubt
my last name is run with me breath for breath
yes I'll blow your lungs out
BLOW! And cut your tongue out
and use that shit to clean my rug out
I aint even start to bug out
somebody requested for the teacher to get active
cuz of all these rappers I look good to battle
Im unattractive when actively in your brain cavity
you be singin 1-2-3, and your family B-D-P
I'm Total 'Cant you see'
I took it there
you bee sayin with your swollin eye
damn it just aint fuckin fair
but your crew told you what was up
you just didn't give a fuck
my lyrics are intact
so my picture you can pin it up
take me out? Give it up your late
I rocked the 9-1-7 when it was 7-1-8
I'm a juvenile deliquent group home lord of the state
the truth about the matter is that I feel great
I'm comin in the form of the mind-bender bar tender
servin that lyrical-net serve your chest then send a
remember battlin MC's Im not always doin
cuz we need new rappers and careers I always ruin
what are you pursuin, who in the hell want this friction
I'll volt your scene and make you drum machine start blitchin
switchin my diction, I'm quick you need a fixin-
Im quick to turn you off like the light in a kitchen
Chorus -sample/scratching of-
Cuz Krs One means simply one Krs
thats it, thats all solo, single the one no less
Verse
I do my dirt and I keep it to myself
I don't speak it on record and to no one else
you think about...
when you do crimes you talk about it
HELL NO! You keep that real shit on the low
cuz prison aint a place you motherfuckers wanna be at
half of you motherfuckers would turn trick
BELIEVE THAT!
yo I can see that, all you ask is where the weed at?
you vision is as far as whereever you throw the seed at
Look at Malcolm X and try to be that
or get lost if you cant pick up where Malcolm X left off
don't you know were listened to by judges and lawyers
when you go to court they play your album for ya
then you turn into Tom Sawyer fiction
beggin a judge to just listen sayin...
if you listen to my album twice, the positive message is....
they shut yo ass up and give you life
Had you hah a wife instead of bein a lover
the court would of seen you as a family man wit some structure
but you is a wild brother, black women you cant respect em
now you catchin wreck in your rep
Negativity never had no pull in jail
yeah, its positivity that they hail
but you fail, cuz red books you can't read em
your people you mislead em
your people you mistreat em
mislead em for fun...my name is KRS ONE!
KRS ONE......KRS ONE

Less than 40,000 a week, they make y'all
Cops y'all with black feet, livin from week to week

They don't really want the beat in us
Take heed to us
While they plottin and schemin to be deletin us
Best believe in us, they not defeatin us
Them glocks wanna bust
With twenty-one shots to put the leak in us
So they can bloody the street with us
What does it mean to us
You know what they need from us
Give cream to us, hide the lies and deceit from us
That doesn't equal us
Who's ready to get in the Jeep with us
Form a fleet with us and take back the street with us
Meet with us, drop bombs in the street with us
Never saw it comin, attack on the sneak with us
Thus, they can't compete with us
We flow through your veins like DJ's
When they cut, you'll be bleedin us
I came with Kris to heat it up
Showin my body's the temple, hip-hop is the lock
Now put the key in us

Stand up brother, stand up sister
I told y'all before, love is gonna get'cha
Lovin that money, lovin that liquor
Lovin that sex without respect you gets no bigger
I ain't got time to chill, only got time to build
You find that in those with skills
This a real MC, of the highest degree
With no video, my show they dyin to see
Not whether I'm buyin 'em three
When you watch television just keep sayin they lyin to me
Cause they are - how long you gonna stay at the bar?
I'm not desperate for money, maybe you are, but listen
[Chorus Two 2X: KRS-One]
First thing we gon' do is make up our - MIND
Then we gon' go, and we gon' clear our - MIND
Erase the doubt and the fear from our - MIND

Don't you think it's time we thought about the future?
Whether our children they gonna be winners or losers?
Don't you think it's time to advance the rhyme we spit?
Whether you know it or not, you deep in politics
All inside of it, in fact YOU the issue
Don't let this government diss you!
They really do not want you to vote
They really do not want you to hope
They really want you sniffin they coke
You look around yo we missin the boat
I coulda wrote about ANYTHING to get on, but this what I wrote
And what I'm writin, is guaranteed to enlighten
Like Dr. Cornel West, Michael Eric Dyson
This is how we do it today, enough of the crime talk
KRS got somethin new to say
Rise up, and put aside childish things
This is the message we bring; listen
[Chorus Two]
[KRS-One]
Last verse, KRS, blast first
Ignorance is bad, but temptation that's worse
They hide they purse, cause of the way we spit the verse
No one ever told 'em that the style's rehearsed
And even if they did, it wouldn't be new to they mind
Cause all day rappers confess to doin these crimes
So when the cops see you, they're not thinkin about me
They thinkin about takin you out of society
Keep it right, don't lie to me
You think it's too much preachin teachin?
Huh, well fine, we'll see
When you're locked up in J.D.C., or even prison
The truth shall set you free, just listen
You want health, and really that's about prevention
You want love, real love, and not depression
You want awareness, which come from discipline and will
You want wealth, which come from skills
When you really ready to talk, let's build
You ain't gotta be a scholar to know the next 4 years gonna be ill
I believe you already know the drill, don't lie
don't steal, seek peace and don't kill

Time for spiritual activism, life is a journey
and Kris got the map with him
Teach latinos and blacks with 'em
It's amazing when whites and asians kick raps with 'em
Cause out of a thousand MC's, believe I taught half of 'em
Knowledge Reigns Supreme, I beam through many images
My origin is a mystery like capstones on pyramids
We live it kid, challenge the teacher you will regret that
I'm giving careers and taking careers away, did you forget that?
* Better check that, you can rock this track and the next track
* But when I correct the spirit hit, you'll always be set back
So gather round now for the raptism
Only those that got hip-hop in 'em
and not rap in 'em and no crack with 'em
Step up now and receive a holy dose
from a holy host, and take a break from these rappers that only boast

When the spirit hear it the lyric long before the track get 'em

I see them glitter but their spirit's goin in and out
We see them fading, we also see them hating
We also see those living for musical chart ratings
Hear what I'm stating or trading for what you're paying
Replace fear with faith and you'll stop decaying

C'mon, gather round now, gather round now, look now
How many times did you pre-meditate
what you thought was your fate, cause you couldn't just wait
You had to have it the way that you thought in your mind
But in the end, everything came in time
But before the time, you was losin your mind
You was racin and rushin and fallin behind
But let me tell you bout God and the way that She works
I mean the way that He works, I mean the way that We work
You gotta trust in your Lord, everything is in accord
Don't rush or fuss, you gonna get yours
Close your eyes, your heart, your ears, your mind
to the ways and thoughts of mankind
And seek ye first the Kingdom of God
And things won't seem so hard
You gotta trust your Lord, uhh, uhh.. tell 'em bout
[Chorus]
Trust and obey, trust when afraid
Trust when you paid, trust when betrayed
Trust when you fear, trust when you unclear
Trust when you here, trust when you near
Trust when you down, trust when you found
Trust when you clown, trust
C'mon, let's do it again, uh, uh
Let's raise it up, c'mon, look
[KRS-One]
After you live and you learn then you see
You will learn how to trust in your G-O-D
You will be so free, you won't see no me
You will only see the will of the almighty
You sick of what?  Well ya will, give it up
Stop thinkin and begin to, live it up
Everytime you think it's one way it's not
Everytime you wanna start you really stop
Trust in the inner the outer is for the sinners
In fact this whole rap is for beginners
Those that have talked and walked upon the path
Know that they get what they want before they act
So why rush, if your respect is due
Whatever you DON'T have is protectin you
Here's what you DO have that be bringin the drama
Ask and it shall be given, with a comma
[Chorus]
{*singers*}
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
You trust in her, trust in him, trust in them, and then
Trust in men, trust in sin, trust in friends
[KRS-One]
Uh uh, soundin good, soundin good, look, look
So when will you be it, when will you see it
That thoughts and things they manifest when you decree it
But God be lookin out for you
Puttin a stop to what you're about to do
In your life, and in your circumstances
Everytime you speak you be takin chances
Talkin bout things that you really don't have to have
So when you get 'em, your life turns sad
Your life turns bad, now why would your God be allowin that?
Trust in God, that's where the crown is at
It's not in what you get, it's what happens after that
So if you think your life is shrinkin
It may be cause you keep thinkin
Not that intellect is wrong
It's just the beginning, it might be time to move on

Here we go!

A good time, a good vibe, and a house with a court
Good life, good wife, a little food for thought
I need (I need) food, clothes, and a whip with rims
I need God in my life
I need family and friends
(I need) money, power, respect, I need love

Every nation, every face and seed to see sun

You need to listen to this
You need to listen to Kris
You need to have peace at least
You need spiritual bliss
You need a lyrical twist
Do you know what a miracle is?
Before we begin, you may need a kiss
I suggest either one from J to O-one from the lips
Either way what I'm saying, yo, is bound to uplift
You need checks, you need cash
You need intellect
You need to be moving fast
You need that big respect
You need to be rolling in a car
Going to a bar that's far
Makin' the deal to make you a star
You need to ask yourself, now do you know who you are?
Where you goin'? How many steps you took so far?
You need patience, you need to control your mind
If you read and don't act, then you're wasting your time
We need better leaders, we need better preachers
We need a three-thousand dollar raise to all teachers

You need some meditation
You need rejuvenation
You need assistance right now with your situation
You need some contemplation
You need a combination
–A combination of will power and concentration
You need some syncopation
With regular relaxation
But you can't, 'cause you runnin' and racin' and chasin'
You need to slow down, maybe you should speed up
One sayin' ""lay down,"" the other's sayin' ""leap up""
You gotta keep up
I suggest you start to speak up
A lawyer, a doctor, a rapper—you wanna be what?
Whatever it is, you gotta visualize
You need to focus for real, and stop livin' them lies
The time you givin' them guys
You could be workin' upon the goal you hold
Yo, you must realize
Yo, you need to be wise
Yo, you need to be alive, there could be no revenge or deceit in your eyes
Rise!
[Chorus]
[KRS]
Gimme what I need
Do it with speed
Change the situation around, plant new seeds!
I roll with a righteous team of adults
Forget the insults
We plan to get results
You can call us a cult, you can call us a gang
But when it comes to Hiphop, no, you cats can't hang
When the Gatts go bang
And the telephone rang
Telling you to come to identify the remains
That's when you feel the pain
And my name comes as comfort, ease and all stress and strain
You need to know the game
You need to know the meaning of your own name
Reprogram your own brain
Ask questions with no shame
How you think you gonna master your craft if you don't train?
Perfecting your skill, that's the aim
Perfect your skill, and you'll always have money and fame
C'mon!
[Chorus]
What I, uhh, what I need
(House on the hill)
That's what I need

That's what I need

(""Bring it back  that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back  that old New York rap"")    repeats in background
The only reality
Is now...
Yo!
Verse One:
I rock slow and easy like soul
The New York flow  is strictly for the pro
Hip hop! Ladies and gents
So you can know  every word yo  of the sentence
Hey la  like De La  I got Common Sense
Save the compliments for after I commence
to evidence of MC's, rockin under false pretense
Yes they get burned like incense
Myrrh and frankencense, you know the consequence
When you rock with KRS and don't make sense
Kris represents all MC's, that rock with ease
I'm not conceited, I got confidence in my abilities
Agility's my credibility
Oratorical artillery in all facilities
It Takes a Village like Hillary
when killin me, KRS has wide range capabilities
On the microphone, in the combat zone
MC's get eaten like the ozone layer
Hey ya, I'm not a playa I'm a teacher
But if I wanted your girl
You'd be Living Single like Latifah
Action Uptown like Monifah
I hit like a beeper, and hot like the bunny on Easter
Lyrically let me freak ya
With moves like Scoob and Scrap
Rock Stready, Stretch, Al and Kiko
I warm up any room like a heater
Bringin a New Balance to the speaker like a sneaker
Still a teacher, prove it, like medicine squared
This Garden of Eden, keeps the party movin
(""Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back, that old New York rap"") - repeat 2X
Verse Two:
I'm interested in skill and how we build as a culture
I don't eat off old material like a vulture
Repeatin myself for wealth is bad for my health
Everyday I express myself with a dope lyric
From my inner spirit, then I share it with others
As they hear me, enhancin
East and West, overseas, brothers and sisters
Sons and daughters transcended all borders
I deal with mind expansion
Anytime you aimlessly dancin, and romancin
It's your life that you be chancin
Not that I wanna sound gloomy
But I don't rhyme about Judy Judy, cutie and shake your booty
When you gonna grow up and be GOD?
Instead of making a rap a full time job
Yeah, it's a job and not an art
They only rhyme to get money;
cause true self-expression takes heart, and guts
Rhymes, and cuts
Tight minds and not tight butts
Reach your goal, like a puck
I wish you good skill and not good luck
Cause only skills put you up out the gutter so I utter
(""Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring it back, that old New York rap"") - repeat 2X
Verse Three:
That old New York flow means wrote for fun
And if the money come, THEN THE MONEY COME
But today and everyday, KRS speaks the truth
We dealing with unemployment in the city black youth
usin rap, to put clothes on they back
No culture, or disciplined, way to act
But soon yo, we'll take care of alla that
We're huntin fi de power help supress people tracks
That keep the culture intact, and soon you will see
In the black community, black unity
Not black nudity, after black puberty
For every crew to see, to breakin down the black community
The only one to blame is you and me
For not takin responsiblity for our artillery
Verbally, you heard of me, Knowledge Reigns Supreme
Over Nubians Everywhere, I kick it cause I care
The end isn't near, it's way over there
BLAOW! The only reality is now
But when I say bring back the old flava
That means bring back the ORIGINAL MC behavior
(""Bring it back, that old New York rap
Bring it bring back, that old New York rap"") - repeat 2X
Verse Four:
Now I got to show you how the BX rocks
MC's, are jumpin out shoes and socks
Body body rock body body rock
I'm the king of rock'n'roll, ahh yeah
Throw your guns in the air! Glocks down
Who the hell is, pagin me at 5 o'clock in the mornin
Where you gonna be, because...
Fresh is the word, many money missin many
Jenifa, oh Jenny
We make up all these rhymes inside our head!
Yo, let's connect politic ditto

What does it mean to be UNDERGROUND?
It means you gotta be free to be UNDERGROUND
Yo, you got your own key when you're UNDERGROUND
If you're listening to me yo you UNDERGROUND
[Verse One]
It's time that I open with a thunder sound
Now look around your own town for the UNDERGROUND
Yo, you rhymin for the TV, or a million CD's?
You ain't a MC, you ain't UNDERGROUND
You could be platinum or gold, hot or cold
But it's the respect you hold that's UNDERGROUND
When the critics don't get, that for the streets you spit it
When your lyric they fear, that's UNDERGROUND
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
Yo, white kids, black kids, skinny kids, fat kids
Them Asian cats be UNDERGROUND
Chicanos, Palestinians, Milanos, fuck the Lone Ranger
Where's Tanto?  That's UNDERGROUND
Freddie Foxxx, Blackalicious, Kweli
M.O.P., GangStarr that's UNDERGROUND
Mad Lion, Smif-N-Wessun, Buckshot
Armageddeon T.S. that's UNDERGROUND, UHH!
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Yo, the t'cha returns, I told y'all I went to Cali to learn
And that shit was UNDERGROUND
If the cops be eyein you, cause survive is what you try to do
Yo I'm wit you, you UNDERGROUND
If it's justice you want, and you protest the ice they flaunt
You want skills that's UNDERGROUND
Yo it's not about a rugger rapper, or an actor
It's about your subject matter that's UNDERGROUND
LOOK!
[Chorus]
[Verse Four]
Chevonne Dean from Ruff Ryders, all the Outsiderz
Young Zee, that's UNDERGROUND
When all your money's spent, and you're still hangin on
to 50 Cent (get it) you UNDERGROUND
When you rep the collective consciousness of hip-hop
Not hip-pop, you UNDERGROUND
Yo it ain't about jewels, bitches and cars
It's about Nas, that's UNDERGROUND, yo!
[Chorus]
[Verse Five]
To be underground simply means that you're down
for the struggle, get 'em up, that's UNDERGROUND
You could be a classy lady or a whore
But if you protest the war, for sure, you UNDERGROUND
If the government can't see you, or deceive you
You love your people, believe you UNDERGROUND
If you refuse to play the game, you go against the grain
You ridin the train, you UNDERGROUND - get it!
[Chorus]
[Verse Six]
Yo, yo, that blast from the past, like Grandmaster Caz
Bam and Flash, that's UNDERGROUND
Doug E. Fresh, Lord Finesse, KRS

Alright party people in the place to be
The party has already started
An-an-an-and it's about to il-il-il-ill *echoes*""
Let me introduce you to another type of rapper MC
where glamour and glitter don't matter gently
I'm tired of the Chattanooga empty
Classical like a German luger
Deep like a tune for scuba diving who am I the hyper
Like I said before my radar's going BIBBIT BIBBIT
The microphone I grip-it grip-it, lyric lyric I live it
Hear it my spirit is where it should be
Don't push me if you pussy, HUH
I spot em, it seems you want to ride the dillz
I got em, KRS got skills in the place
I waste megahertz of bass bottom, chill
As I rock em and get ill, I build the perfect spot to kill
Verbal excitement will lead to your indictment
Whether or not you like it, still, number one I hype it
Your album, rewrite it
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
Triplet syllables for minimal criminals
Lyrical riddles that got hard flavors in the middle
Sit back and chittle as I stand and still rebuild on skills
The admission of serial lyrics, calculated to weaken the spirit
will be diverted by this lyric when you hear it
Ricochet any style any day
Any which way and you'll Cherish the Day like Sade
The advanced oratorical techniques I speak
Keep the heat at full peak!  My grammar
with stamina, grabs a rapper like the fresh catch of the day
and crack the back of that DJ
I'm strappin and attackin a pack
And whatever happens after that just happens, FACT
Flamboyant and flashy is one point in time when you're not ashy
Focus on the syllable formats and the cash G
G for guard your grill, I'm hard to kill
Odd but ill, a job to fill is to refill on skills
We built and killed style and skill
while poetically recriminate you like a child I will
get ill, and switch to earn
Cause I prefer to slur but not blur
Blurring you're stirring up trouble surely you don't need it
be seated I'm undefeated dem not see it
Observe me then beat it
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
Let's get back to the point quickly, get with me
The voice from New York City is too witty
I come from a era of ?OJ cars?, Latin Quarter
fake Gucci and fake Fendi, you can't send me
Nowhere, that I ain't been to
You can't tell me nuttin that I ain't been through
Disrespect the teacher I gots to get you
*cause they can't MC*
But what you really sayin
You sound like a bitch-ass rapper when he's saying
""Yo Kris you hit too hard"" stop playing!
Switching and swaying
Day in and day out, your styles are played out, see you way out
Before you're laid out, your bright lights start to fade out
The last thing you heard is ""Who let the K out?""
?No great area?
Everything is black and white we took the gray out it's scarier
Either you're winnin or losin, spinnin the rules of conscience
But lyrically there ain't no stoppin
I'm droppin a lot in your noggin
Cause I know that you're lyrically starvin
Carbon, your name, battle battle
Everybody wants to battle but you BAB-BLE
Who knows ya, battlin me, is the only way that you can gain exposure
I feel for ya soldier
I hate to say it but I told ya so
You know that I know the ancient flow KRS-One
is the holder of a boulder yo, money folder yo
You want a fresh style let me show you slow
your blow, I'm not your foe
Battling me?  No no no no no no NO!
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
How many MC's, wannabemceez
Never be MC's, cause they can't MC
[Mad Lion]
If a DJ think he man den he better prepare for war!!
BDP crew get up in that ass like a piece of toilet tissue
General Lion I chase them all and I am on fiyah
Represent the hardest crew, you know how we do
Anything tess, dead!  Gun shot to dem head

What kinda world are we livin in?  Yo

Break bread with my people?  Move ahead with my people?

When every day, seven thousand kids are gettin locked up
When every day the justice system seems to stay stocked up
When every day they cuttin 'em down 'fore they even pop up
When every day you gotta duck 'fore you get shot up
What kinda world are we livin in, spinnin in
Winnin in, sinnin in, let us begin again
Churches are ran like corporations makin me holla
Corporations are ran like churches praisin the dollar
There's no way out, or is it?  Release your doubt and live it
Teachin metaphysics don't listen to these critics hear it

Speak for yourself, never weaken yourself, by deceivin yourself
Believe in your wealth, c'mon!

What kinda world are we livin out, we move about
in fear and doubt, tryin to get more clout

to a morality drought, basically I'm callin 'em out
What kinda world are we livin in, when a song
will not get on, unless it talks 'bout thongs
Now where did we go wrong?  We don't have long
Preference all torn all worn not norm and all gone
What kinda world do we live around, when we lay around

while we play around, we fallin, stallin
while God's callin, all in to fall in

When every day another person is betrayed by a friend
When every day it never ends, and the people pretend

What kinda world can we really trust
when the cops they can shoot at us?  Bo bo!
What kinda world can we really grow (ohh)

[s] Nah, democracy is a goal to be attained.
[K] That's right. The character of the people should be reflected

[s] Psssh, I don't see my character reflected!

WHY, are all the schools they fallin apart
and WHY, the youth not takin no musical art
and WHY, the professionals really don't know where to start
No, one, really, cares, about

and WHY, the radio station they help with the slaughter

will ruin what you doin if you crime pursuin
Let me tell you bout gettin your family out the mean ghetto
to green meadows, where you can finally be settled
That street level, freak level, pullin out heat level
Eatin meat level, deceit level, that's that beast level
You gotta stand upright in a house with three levels
Where you don't even see devils unless he shovels the snow
Many philosophers live on the low
Never crazy hazy or lazy we get up and go
Whaddya know, I'm always teaching after the show
Not messin with hoes, I'm with my wife, changin my clothes
Blowin my nose, deliverin blows to foes
with new flows; then disappear where nobody knows
Cause I got too many questions, too many lessons
I gotta go, too many people stressin but I gotta know

But they come on the TV lookin so swell
Sellin you dreams of schemes of you gettin green and cream
But they never explain the work and all it means

and visualize, minimize lies
See yourself bigger in size, quicker to rise up
wise up climb up, before your time's up but

Women will treat you right
But you can't be one of them lookin a freak you lookin a beat you type
You gotta seek the light in the dark
I used to free this mic in the park
Now I speak direct to your heart
Women want men to show respect for they art
Women don't be checkin for the chart
They go straight to sister to sister and pick it apart
Begin with the heart, our sisters is a living art
Always givin, always deliverin, always making something bigger from just a little part
Big up to the sisters that start up businesses
With nothing but muffins, still liftin kids
Strong women ,work long women
Not them dump-ass dizzy stupid thong women
King-Kong women, bring it all women, independent women with thoughts & opinions
Women like G.Simone, See, I maybe the Pharaoh
But believe she is the crown Let me leave it alone
Cause a lot of ya still wanna rome, they got houses but still want home
Sittin on chrome but forever alone
Cause intelligent courageous women they were never shown
They say they don't love them hoes
But Jesus allowed hoes to wash in all his toes
I don't mean to impose, but if you want a woman to treat you right
I don't think you need to start with the clothes
I think you need to start with what she knows

That's what you got to know from the start
Whats in the heart & the mind
Without that you startin out blind

Diamonds are a girl's best friend, not mine
You got it, FINE - but what about that rhyme?

Where cops can't chase or invade my space
We turn up the bass, you tremble in the place
Phones ain't traced and flows we don't waste
Hoes we don't chase or kiss, they know they place
with Kris or Christ, they'll lose their life
You don't lose if you come in two's, you and a wife
But you crews wanna be bruised, so choose your knife
Choose your gat, choose your rat, when the smoke clears

Loosen that noose around your neck and back

Everybody up top! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, all my cats in the front! (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)
Yo, yo, all my cats in the back (HO!) (HO!) (HO!) (HO!)

[CHORUS]
My rhymes still be ill
You don't really want it
I suggest you chill
You don't really want it
#1 I'm still
You don't really want it
The prophecy is fulfilled
You don't really want it
KRS in the streets
You don't really want it
I drop the rawest beats
You don't really want it
No ice just heat
You don't really want it
Playa face defeat
That was a nice try Nelly
I don't mean to be bold, but put that ""Hot in herre"" bullshit on hold
And let's get down to the facts of the matter
In the dictionary under wack rap, you the rapper
It's simply cuz you're lacking the spectacular vernacular
And hip hop's character seems to be in back of ya
Either that or you're truly amateur
I'm askin ya, how does it feel to have the whole world laughin at ya?
You just too stupid to see
I was made on the streets, you was made on MTV
How you gonna talk about my nose to attack me?
When you steady guzzlin them pills for your acne?
My nose comes from a line of kings
Your acne comes from you eatin the wrong things
Your words don't make me hurt, they make you work
You'll hurt when you find it's you gettin jerked
I tell ya, it don't take me to say
Don't buy your album, street cats ain't buyin it anyway
You tellin me make up my mind
Yet on your album, you don't know if you wanna sing, or rhyme
[CHORUS]
You tryin to diss me?  How?
If it wasn't for the true-school your bitch-ass wouldn't be here now
Blau blau, show me respect from the gate
Or I'ma have to drown you kids like Andrea Yates
You can't handle the break, I'm a flamethrowa, you a bic lighta
You think I'm cocky cuz you a dickrida
I spit tighter
I'm not like all the rest I'm not a playa but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express
So nevertheless I'ma teach ya, teach ya
But when them slugs hit you, you'll be screamin, ""Momma, EI! EI!""
You never seen me sing?  You don't know what I bring?
You'll be singing the blues like BB King
I'm all about the unity of Miss and Mistas
You all about grabbin money and dissin our sistas
Take your ass back to TV land
And let this be a lesson, you can't see me man!
[CHORUS]
Just when I thought I could do my gospel
And become an apostle I got a whole to get hostile
I don't mean to knock ya Nelly
But ain't you that MTV house nigga with a spine like jelly?
I'ma do this by the book, for the art
I heard what you said on BET's 106 and Park
But what you don't know, is right around the corner on 3rd
I hold a Desert Eagle, and no, it's not a bird
You sound absurd, you're gonna bring ME back?
I taught all year round the spot ??? had
Copycat, with sloppy raps, you chill with N'Sync, I chill where hip hop be at
[CHORUS]
