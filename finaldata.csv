Yeah you know, we always tryin to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy.. but I'm tellin you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin over, and I'm so glad
Cause I never stopped rappin, but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda did somethin else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin 'bout quittin, don't ever
[Chorus: Too $hort]
Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up, you just cain't!
[Too $hort]
Comin up is hard, givin up is easy
You always get the game from your homey Too Sheezy
I keep it so real, never spit it false
I hope you make it big and if you ever fall off
Remember these words, it's only what you make it
Anything is possible you want it better take it
I ain't talkin 'bout stealin, felonies'll ruin it
Stupid all I'm talkin 'bout is takin opportunities
Doors open up and when you get another chance
Either hold up the wall, or get out there and dance
It's on you, do what you wanna do
You know why everybody always punkin you
Talkin shit they know you're bluffin, won't do nothin
Sittin on the shelf like Stove Top Stuffin
I know you had enough and want to call it quits
Believe me, this ain't it
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
Isn't hard to see, use your eyes
It's time to tell the truth, cause we through witcha lies
Utilize all your steppin stones, gotta be prepared
Sittin 'round dreamin how you bout to be a player
The years and the time fly, you ain't even workin
Went by overnight you went from 18 to 30
Nothin goin on, never set a goal
Dreams can't come true, and now you gettin old
You start to represent, everything you hate
But don't give up, cause it's never too late
All you need is a plan, a purpose and a motto
And quit livin life like you 'bout to hit the lotto
Get rich on your own, buy a new home
Keep your real friends, leave them haters alone
I see you when you get there, rollin to the bank
I know you cain't let go, I know you cain't
[Chorus] (minus first ""don't"")
[Too $hort]
Nah we can't give up, gotta keep hustlin for life baby
It's hard on the black man, tryin to get my stack together y'know?
Big thangs..

Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
[Too $hort]
I know you like it when I cum in your mouth
You like it in the car, you like it on the couch
You like to lay me on my back, and spit on my nuts
Suck it up like a slut, and then you wanna fuck
You make me feel like I'll never know a better friend
I hope you never stop, I hope it never ends
I must be tastin', somethin' like your favorite flavor
Can you do it again? You said maybe later
Baby wait a little while, you said your jaws was hurtin'
So I turned out the lights and closed all the curtains
But when you closed your eyes I put my balls on your cheek
Cause I'm wide awake and can't fall asleep
Now lick it
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
[Too $hort]
Yeah I'm one of those rappers, I reap the benefits
I'll fuck a Too $hort fan, a cute freaky lil' bitch
I used to go to L.A. and get sucked by Super Head
When you was just a kid gettin' sent straight to bed
You used to get ya ass whooped when ya listened to $hort
But now she's all grown up with my dick in her throat
The way you take it out, then you stick in your mouth
I bet you won a gold medal at the Dick Olympics now
I just spit the pimpin', I like the thick women
I like the slim goodies and the real big women
But I just love the way you lickin', it's original
I feel like a pimp-player-mack-daddy-gigolo
Damn
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
[Too $hort]
Remember Tina? Tina, the sperm cleaner?
I had a good time last time I seen her
Blowjob Betty, Deepthroat Dana
You're always so ready, I'm cummin' on your cranium
Right now, this is just wonderful
I can't tell, it's like you havin' more fun than $hort
It's better than - two bitches at the same time
Or even ten dime-pieces, standin' in line
Takin' turns, while they suck on each others clits
Want a nigga with some game to nut on her upper lip
Massagin' her tongue, while I tickle her tonsils
It's no doubt though, I get big in your mouth hoe
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)

Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nuthin like pimpin just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shithead bitch
My diamonds and the Lex say it's time to flow
Wonder how I got rich, they say I rhyme too slow, so
I'm from the ""O"" I for what I know
And like I told your ass before you can fuck my hoe
I ride nuthin but vogues, ain't hittin no switches
Top down in my Caddy just me and my bitches
With a Ziplock bag full of green weed
I roll it all up cuz I'm a fiend in need
Of some dank smoke all up in my chest
Dangerous Crew got the bomb, we don't smoke that stress
Cuz we getting funky on album 9
I smoked a few joints bitch now I'm fine
Studio's in a cloud
Smelling kind of loud
Nuthin like pimpin
Nigger fuck Bill Clinton
Make me the mother fucking president
I'll make the White House a hoe house and all the pimps, To just
Set up shops like they do in Vegas
Legalize pimpin for all the playa's
Puttin fine ass bitches in the streets and the hood
Every year a nigger trade for a new Fleetwood
You know I'm rollin, I can't be faking
I come through and all your hoes I'm taking
You know I'm rolling, don't do no simpin
I'm an Oaktown playa ain't nuthin like pimpin
Ain't nuthin like the pimp game you should know
Never love a bitch or a hoe
You fell in love with her though trying to get in them pants
And the next thing ya know your baby momma's a tramp
Don't get mad now nigger want to shove the bitch
Cuz a year ago, you know, you loved the bitch
Now your stomache's upset and your feelings are hurt
She gotcha looking like an old banana peel in the dirt
Bitch, slipped up and hit your ass for a lick
Talking that mother fucking baby shit
You'z a punk ass nigger can't you see
Thatz the difference between niggers like you and me
I got bitches, on my mind
It's been like that for a real long time
I know the way them hoes take your cash
They let you fuck and make you pay up fast
Trick nigger, why you wanna be like that
Let them try for lent bitches take your fat ass stack
Couldn't tell them hoes nuthin but the punk in you
Cuz they already know what they want from you
Big bank, Ben Franklin, do the bitch just fine
She'll be taking all of yours and can't fuck with mine
I'm the M to the A to the C and K
All you playa hating niggas shouldn't be that way
There ain't nuthin like pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nuthin like pimping just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shit head bitch
Lights, camera, action, cut
Hollywood look out the bitch is coming up
She took acting classes 'bout to be on her way
On a Greyhound bus from home to L.A.
She said it wouldn't take long to make it to the top
A few auditions land a job
I was down in L.A., hit the club for a drink
I'm a player ass nigger tell me what do ya think
I walked up to the bitch in my clean ass suit
And I told her, I've been watching you
I peeped you out from the bar
You must be a model or a movie star
She said ""No, but that's my dream.
To see my face on the movie screen""
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth
She was talking 'bout agents, I was turning her out
I said ""Listen real close to what I'm saying.
All you need is me; you don't need no agent""
I'm a pimp ass nigger and the game don't stop
""All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots,
Cause if you can't do that, they're going to hold ya back""
She was sucking up the game, down to do all that
She said ""Short baby, I ain't no simp""
But the nigger in the suit ain't nuthin but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They weren't big shots, they were nothing but tricks
She came to me and said it just won't last
I looked, and I laughed, and I kicked her ass
Cuz all she wanted was the fame
But you can't get shit when you don't have game
Guerilla pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Guerilla pimps just don't quit
I say mother fuck you damn shithead bitch

Too Short:
Say hoe
yeah you
Can I ask you a question
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don't want me to talk to you like that
Will you like to make love?
I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and your so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I'm a mack, I cold turn you out
I wont ask, and I sure won't beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it, don't watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I'm the man
I take you out to the finest resturant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose
But later on your coming out them pantie hose
You want gold, girl whats next
It's me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I'm just a freak
Give it up baby, I can't wait two weeks
I want it all, Don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't . . .
-girls voice-
Nigger please
You provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you short, because of your height or your width
Dis me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigger, the kind you don't take home
scissor tights and Barbie from the dangerous zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...
-Too $hort-
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigger in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you though, or sell your blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...
-Girls Voice-
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming ,and sceeming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough
For you I feel disgust
Wait, small things I hate
For goodness sakes, If I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me, shows of gracious behavior
I have to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step you to my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Jealous of you got some, nigger please your lying
Cause I fight the feeling, that would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...
-Rappin 4 Tay-
I am the rapper that they call 4 tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't body tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a (low bass) girl it really don't take to long
But a (low bass) girl's always trying to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give it some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a Camasol
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, this time to unwhine
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me numb...
-Too $hort-
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way to real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank hoe
Go get your bank hoe
My little dick'll have you screaming though
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I can't really say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!!

Pimp niggas don't pay a dime,
I'm fuckin 2 bitches at the same time
Then I hit the studio and I write a rhyme,
I Call it ""Tramp Hoes Aint Hard to Find""
Verse 1:
I took 2 bitches to a hotel
I told em both ""you know I won't tell""
Bitch, curiosity killed the cat
you gotta lick the clit while I hit it from the back
Don't be stingy girl, lick my balls too
You was talkin big shit when I called you
You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you ""look around, who you wanna fuck?""
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now its time to fuck
Hook
Verse 2:
When we got to my room she started actin nervous
Sat down and said ""lets order room service""
I said ""bitch, what are ya smokin?
A big fat dick comin from East Oakland""
I stuck it in her mouth she started moanin
I said ""hang up, get off my telephone, bitch""
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town started freakin them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck I'm a player
I been doin this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm payin hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it
Hook
Verse 3:
Them bitches kissed 20 minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, lil momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent 20 more minutes lickin each others breasts
Two titty suckin hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin on a fat one, layin in the cut
After seein this shit, I aint wanna fuck
I wanna see how long they can keep goin
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was gettin my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fuckin them sluts till the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit aint really nuthin to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fuckin your freak, nigga
Hook
Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin 2 bitches at the same time,
Fuckin 2 bitches at the same time
Let em know pimp niggas dont pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps aint hard to find nigga
Bitch
2 Bitches
2 of em

You'z a punk ass nigger can't you see
Thatz the difference between niggers like you and me
I got bitches, on my mind
It's been like that for a real long time
I know the way them hoes take your cash
They let you fuck and make you pay up fast
Trick nigger, why you wanna be like that
Let them try for lent bitches take your fat ass stack
Couldn't tell them hoes nuthin but the punk in you
Cuz they already know what they want from you
Big bank, Ben Franklin, do the bitch just fine
She'll be taking all of yours and can't fuck with mine
I'm the M to the A to the C and K
All you playa hating niggas shouldn't be that way
There ain't nuthin like pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Ain't nuthin like pimping just don't quit
Mother fuck you damn shit head bitch
Lights, camera, action, cut
Hollywood look out the bitch is coming up
She took acting classes 'bout to be on her way
On a Greyhound bus from home to L.A.
She said it wouldn't take long to make it to the top
A few auditions land a job
I was down in L.A., hit the club for a drink
I'm a player ass nigger tell me what do ya think
I walked up to the bitch in my clean ass suit
And I told her, I've been watching you
I peeped you out from the bar
You must be a model or a movie star
She said ""No, but that's my dream.
To see my face on the movie screen""
I tell ya nothing but game came out my mouth
She was talking 'bout agents, I was turning her out
I said ""Listen real close to what I'm saying.
All you need is me; you don't need no agent""
I'm a pimp ass nigger and the game don't stop
""All you gotta do is fuck a few big shots,
Cause if you can't do that, they're going to hold ya back""
She was sucking up the game, down to do all that
She said ""Short baby, I ain't no simp""
But the nigger in the suit ain't nuthin but a pimp
And all them white guys you had sex with
They weren't big shots, they were nothing but tricks
She came to me and said it just won't last
I looked, and I laughed, and I kicked her ass
Cuz all she wanted was the fame
But you can't get shit when you don't have game
Guerilla pimpin just let it roll
Mother fucking shit god damn asshole
Guerilla pimps just don't quit
I say mother fuck you damn shithead bitch

Too Short Feat Icecube
Too Short:
Now take my bitch
She won't complain about shit cus she's my ho
She don't belong to a trick
So when you fuck her and give her all your cash
I get paid or put my foot in her ass
I won't marry the bitch and give her half
I get more head and then I laugh
At that one bitch shit I got a gang of Hoes
I get freaks ass lick these balls and toes
Icecube:
Now stupid little bitches get tossed
If they don't realise I'm the motherfucking boss
Come on down and get your ass pinched
And if you talk shit get your ass lynched
Cus I'm the B. the I. the T. the C. the H.
The K. the I. the L. the L.the A. Icecube
A nigga that's bigger then a nut
Cus a bitch is a bitch is a hoe is a slut
Too Short:
You say how can I call a woman a bitch
It ain't nothing but a word like shit
Ain't no slippin in my mutha-fucking pimpin
And all bitches ain't women
You come home and get smooth cussed out
You got a bitch with a foul assed mouth
Scared to chip her with a left hook
Youz a bitch in my book
Bitch
Icecube:
My nigger (Jinx???) made the mix
So punkass mutha-fucking bitches get the eighty-six
I keep hoes on five
Cus I'm fucking more pussy then the law allows
With my boy Too Short
See he quick to grab a bitch by the throat
And slam her ass cram her ass
With a fat dick cus she's a trick bitch
Too Short:
I like fat bitches and I like em slim
I take a fat bitch and stick my dick right in her
Big fat ass she'll make me come again
I'm mack daddy bitch fuck her friend
I saw your home girl she said what's up with us
I said nothing fucked her on the tour bus
She got it good too dick down on the floor
The bitch was fine but her pussy ain't as good as yours
Icecube:
Well she's a straggler struggler straight Salome smuggler
Every time I see the bitch, she's looking uglier
And if you got a trick ass on your left
Sitting there with dick on her breath
Last night she sucked my dick now she's kissing little man
Won't even suck my dick unless cut out the middle man
And if you have never heard of me
Youz a bitch
It ain't but a word to me
Female voice:
I'll stop calling ya Biotch
Too Short:
Man Fuck these hoes man, ya know
(nappy ass bitch ass tramp ass sluty ass hoe)
Female voice:
I'll stop calling ya, Biotch
Too Short:
I go hard on a bitch fuck respect for ya men
I get my way with a bitch when I act like a pimp
Always carrying bank but I fooled the bitch
Cause all she ever got was to drool on my dick
Ice Cube will slap a hoe for the fuck of it
Just like me and that's some real shit
Bitch got bold with her loud ass mouth
Tough ass bitch got knocked out
You know a bitch ain't nuthin but a word to me
Some of you punks are just scared to see
If you could call that bitch a bitch you would
And if you can't you probably should
I'm spitting game to you mark ass lames
On how how to get a bitch and treat the bitch like shit
You can't buy love all pimps know that
It's all about the way old Short Dogg macks
Don't hold the bitch hand or walk side by side
Go first class every time you fly
She'll go Greyhound and just meet you there
I'm just an ice cold hard ass Oakland player
You want to tongue kiss bitch it figures
I introduce you to my homeboy Richard
Also known by his nickname dick
Now lets tongue kiss bitch
Ice Cube:
I like big butts so let it be known to the public
I bust a rap or two and the bitches love it
I'm only out for one thing so hate me
I ain't the one so don't try to fade me
I don't wear too much gold because it's tacky
I bust a Raider hat T-Shirt and Khakis
See a lot of hoes in freaky clothes everyday
So I talk to em in any ole can I way
See a bitch need a nigger to coach em
So I grab my dick and smoothly approach em
I say ""hi"" and I'm really kind of pitched
If they ignore me then I say ""Yo freak bitch""
Give up the number hardly we'll have a slumber party
You see I'll fuck you to death and then I'll dump the body
Cause I'm a nigger that's bigger than crew or a gang
And when it comes to bitches I'm out for only one thang
Yo bitch ain't nothing but a word to me Short

And like I told your ass before you can fuck my hoe
I ride nuthin but vogues, ain't hittin no switches
Top down in my Caddy just me and my bitches
With a Ziplock bag full of green weed
I roll it all up cuz I'm a fiend in need
Of some dank smoke all up in my chest
Dangerous Crew got the bomb, we don't smoke that stress
Cuz we getting funky on album 9
I smoked a few joints bitch now I'm fine
Studio's in a cloud
Smelling kind of loud
Nuthin like pimpin
Nigger fuck Bill Clinton
Make me the mother fucking president
I'll make the White House a hoe house and all the pimps, To just
Set up shops like they do in Vegas
Legalize pimpin for all the playa's
Puttin fine ass bitches in the streets and the hood
Every year a nigger trade for a new Fleetwood

I used to have a lot of bitches
Straight down for me
Doin' anything I said, even hoe on the street
But I'm a dog and I dog my broads
Guerrilla pimpin', drivin' four door cars
Ain't got no kids but them bitches love daddy
They had to share me or them bitches couldn't have me
Cause I'm a Mack with a capital M
Call me $hort Dog baby, put the P in the Pimp
I keep my foot in your ass and wouldn't give a fuck
Get out her pocket, bitch you gettin' beat up
You see me hangin' with them niggas like jock
And every single five mile, bitches gettin' popped
Well now I got a rep and they say I'm wrong
I beat my broad ass and she moved back home
Came in one night, I was buzzin'
Bitch tried to front me for fuckin' her cousin
She started yellin', man, the bitch got raw
I took one step back and went straight to her jaw
I gives a fuck that the bitch left
Cause all she ever got was some good dick
And it really ain't shit to find another bitch
Cause I'm a cool motherfucker and I'm hella rich
(Yeah) Ant Banks in the house and you know he knows
Grab the mic nigga, fuck these hoes
Ant Banks:
Yeah, I'm thinkin' back 'fore a nigga just came up
Playin' games with the bitches
Thought a nigga might change but
I was tight thinkin' everything's all right
Doin' the same shit to a different bitch every night
Just dickin'em down like a gigolo
So you gotta peep game from a nigga though
I'm too young to get sprung so don't trip, tell'em
(Ain't no love, bitch)
So let's speak about a freak named Connie
Fucked the bitch tough, backstage at the Omni
I can't forget Constance, the bitch is so dumb
Quick to lick my nuts, suck my dick, and just hum
And these are just some hoes
That a nigga like tossed up, kinda crossed up
Turned out and lost but I ain't trippin'
They all got tramped
Used and abused till they all just vamped
And left a nigga stuck with no kind of get back
Now I even get shook by the hoodrats
Cause they know what the fuck they gon' get
Took for they cash and a mouth full of dick, huh
And I hate I gotta be that way
Goin' vicious on these bitches
Just made'em all leave today
But I know it won't last long
They sayin' fuck Ant Banks
Now all my bitches is gone
Too $hort:
All my bitches are gone, them bitches bounced
I had a gang of'em, now they can't be found
They ain't fuckin' with $hort Dog
Cause I'm from Oakland
You fuck with us bitch, somethin' gettin' broken
Your leg, arm, jaw, nose, pick a part
Oakland motherfuckers'll break your heart
Until you recognize game in your face
You's a punk ass bitch, ain't never been no place
I can't hold back, now's the time
To leave your stank fake broke ass bitches behind
And move on like a player
I'm knockin' ghetto hoes and even squares
Secretaries, nurses, and police women
I'm flyin' first class, nigga, fuckin' flight attendents
$hort Dog ain't nothin' but a dog, beeyatch
(Ain't nothin' new nigga, come again)
All my bitches are gone, them bitches cut
But I really don't give a fuck
I always knew I didn't need that hoe
I got the game from the motherfuckin' E-S-O
And you can tell when I hit the place
All them star-struck bitches jump in my face
And get shot to the curb like I'm the mob
Unless they givin' niggas blowjobs
Ant Banks:
Yeah, and when a bitch wanna flirt
I put in work, treat'em all like dirt
And watch them get they feelin's hurt
Cause I'm a mack, hoe, listen to this rap, hoe
And you will know not to fuck around
You'll get slapped, hoe
For tryin' to fuck up the Ant Banks program
Steady saltin' with your stanky ass toe jams
You're mad cause I wouldn't spend no time
I'm with the homies, makin' cash
pullin' bitches and writin' rhymes
I'm just doin' what I got to do
I'm not fuckin' with you
Because your funky ass cock is through
So now I gotta get some new hoes
Some old school bitches
That's still ridin' trues and vogues
I want a freak with the gangsta look
That Ant Banks can hook
And the bitch better know how to cook
Cause I'm a nigga that'll eat some shit up
Macaroni, steak, collard greens, or whatever the fuck
Yeah $hort, you know how we do'em
Treat bitches like red lights and run right through'em
I got my mack on strong and my dick on long
So fuck it, all my bitches can stay gone
Too $hort:
Mine too
Ant Banks:
You know what I'm sayin'?
Too $hort:
Yeah, beeyatch
Ant Banks:
$hort Dog in the motherfuckin' house
Too $hort:
Nah nigga, you in this motherfucker
Ant Banks:
Bringin' this shit for nine-tre and nine-four
You know what I'm sayin'?
Get in where you fit in, hoes
Too $hort:
Before you need a check up from the neck up
Ant Banks:
Peace out
Fuck these bitches, man
Fuck these bitches, $hort,
Let's get out of here, man

All the time, gettin mine, that's why I'm pimpin
That's why I'm pimpin, all the time
Gettin mine..
That's how we do it, straight pimpin
All the time, all the time
It's the original, D-O-G, Short Dawg
They said don't do it, but I gotta go off
You talked a lot of shit and can't back it up
Say you make a lot of money and can't stack enough
Spend it on the strippers and the prostitutes
Do what you gotta do
No SoundScans got your record label hot at you
They droppin you, two years ago we was poppin you
You was talkin shit about nobody stoppin you
I told the lil' homey a long time ago
If you put your mind to it, you can find some dough
It don't matter, even if yo' pockets kinda low
All you gotta do is knock a fine ass hoe
Fuck that bitch like a porno star
Walk her to the corner I bet she won't go far
I knew the day would come when you would notice it
Get wise and realize bein broke ain't shit
Chorus: Too $hort
That's why I'm pimpin, all the time
Gettin hoes to give me money, I'm gettin mine
You know I ain't lyin
cause what I spend and what I'm ridin is the shit
That's why I do this; straight pimpin, all the time
If you see my bitch hoein, I'm gettin mine
You know I ain't lyin, tricks love what I'm supplyin
It's the shit, that's why I do this

It's been around a long time
Pimpin, manipulatin minds, prostitutin women
Pussy - is worth a lot of money
She says that everyday you gotta pay me when you want me
Tricks like to fuck and do that freaky shit
You know I kick my hoe ass, she don't bring me gifts
I'm talkin cold cash money, nothin else'll do
Get my money bitch you better fuck until he's through
Make that trick come quick, and don't stop him
And if he's slippin, you better rob him
Go out and turn another date, don't hesitate
You know daddy loves you when you keep my money straight
You ride the best cars, eat good, and drink fat
You can't do this shit without me don't you ever think that
Recognize my bald head and my gangsta limp
Damn it feels good to be a pimp
Chorus
[Too $hort]
I hear you squares, you try to criticize us players
but when the pussy's on sale I see you always there
A good customer, you know yo' game ain't tough
And even though we came up doin all the same stuff
I'm a pimp, I turn a bitch out quick
Have her standin on the corner tryin to get some dick
Lay on yo' back bitch, and get my cash
Cause if you don't, I gotta kick yo' ass
Fuck all that drama
This ain't HBO I whup you like yo' momma
if you don't pay me hoe, I do this everyday
I check bitches and get paid
I want the money I ain't tryin to get laid
Ain't nuttin new about this shit, it's the oldest profession
Sellin pussy while it's snowin at the coldest intersection
I know how you feel about me, you love me
Turnin tricks thinkin of me

I am trying to dump her
I already fucked her
You need to get on bitch and find you a sucker
Get married divorced and get half
Maybe you should reason with her before she gets mad
Or maybe my nigga you should slap that bitch
If not then you need to snatch that bitch
By the throught and let her know this is how it goes
Say whats on your mind, now she knows
Some of y'all ladies need to check your man
For acting like a bitch every time he gets a chance
Backslap him tell him shut up and stop crying
And stop all that wineing
Bitch ass nigga you need to buy yourself some business
and quit askin all them motherfucking questions
Ain't no slaves around here
Ain't nobody gettin payed around here
It's all true about this hoes and me
You ain't got no game you don't know what she needs
Lame than a motherfucker about this mack shit
Still letting bitchs monipulate your actions
When you going learn how to wear the pants
Try and give this real player rythem a chance
It's all about the money and feeding your family
If I am macking hoes and you can't stand me
Keep my name out your LYIN mouth
You hate a player and I find out
I might fuck your bitch little sister or your momma
More than one time just to add to the drama
Give you something to talk about
Life long trick learn your mouth
Cause I don't stop macking and I am always rapping
I fucked your little sister but I was just praticing
Short little THICK bitch I picked her up
Diggin this big ass dick in her gut
I LEFT her WALKIN funny
Whats wrong $hort Dogg last night got his fuck on
And you was trying to hate me I got cha
I fucked your little sister nigga anything is possible
Too $hort

Studd:
Is the shit gone ever change, cause I be caught up in the middle of it,
Click my pistol, and then in his fuckin throat I shoved it
Give me your money, and take that palve' off nigga,
Fuck Tommy 'Figga, I'm off that doe and liquor
See I be drillin in the eastside of San Pedro Park,
I smoke a camel, the lupsia done have me sparked
This lil' broad said I'm livin in my last days,
My mother love me, she say she hate my bad ways
But still she blame it on herself for doin what she done,
It wasn't fun, she moved us in the ghetto slums
So what you think about myself cause I'm a grown man,
A bad man, survival is whatever you can
You think you know it, flossin but I know you's a bitch,
Cause I be watchin, tryin to get my rob on this shit,
See niggas underestimate the city that I claim,
Where I am niggas sayin what the fuck is gangbang
Hard livin mothafucka represent your turf, your side of town,
You know thats where the fuck I'm found
Knees dirty, hands dirty, smokin on a tree,
Gamblin my drug money, hell yeah tee-da-lee
Cause I'm the nigga says crime do pay,
My people say they love me, they just say they hate my bad ways
Real bad ass ways (bad ways)
Real bad ass ways (you got bad ways)
Real bad ass ways
Get glock cause it pays
Murda One:
>From city to city, state to state,
I'm checkin my game with my muthafuckin trusted 38
But wait bubonic at an all time low,
Gotta hit the ATM to get money fo' sho'
Reclinin in my Cadillac, puffin Newports,
Eighteen on bump straight up bumpin Too $hort
You caught in the middle of a skanless ass vibe,
We copped another sack so you know my ass high
Funk made by my nigga named X,
Bitches with the fat lips and fat ass, I want to sex
Check this, nuts to your chin now fin,
I recommend mothafuckin hoes make your knees bend
You can't get with this on any day,
Best believe Murda One got the mothafuckin bad ass ways
Bad ass ways (you know it mothafuckas)
Real bad ass ways
Real bad ass ways
Joe Riz:
I'm livin live on hinges, when niggas in Benzes I'm broke,
I'm givin nothin but hell y'all its cut throat
I wrote a rhyme, called it a pastime,
Of hurtin ass shit that I faced the last time
My last dime, goes on food I'm in the mood for a stick-up,
To pick up lil' somethin on a get up
You hit up, blessed by the way I protest,
Your world, gettin it all of my chest
Yes the struggle grab me, hatin better have me,
Drama from my Momma, disowned by my Daddy
What should I do, tuck my head and throw them rolos,
If anybody know about the trouble I bet Joe knows
And raw livin it remind me,
Of the shit that I wanna put behind me
I'm stayin high for days cause what I'm doin it pays,
They don't hate me really, they hate my bad ways
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
They hate my bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Too $hort:
I've been a player for years, this aint no rappers dream,
You leavin messages, on her answering machine
I'm in the bed, listenin, laughin, ticklin, giglin, kickin it,
Nigga I be stickin it
You was hugged up with her when I met her,
She gave me that look like please make it better
I told her with my eyes, meet me over there,
Instantly, she was the victim of a player
I be spittin this game like Iceberg Slim,
What about your man, she said ""Fuck him""
Let's roll, so we jumped in the Benz,
Left you at the bar, talkin to your friends
$hort Dog came through with the satisfaction,
Now you runnin round like a fatal attraction
Cause I been in the pussy for the last few days,
Don't take it personal, it's just my bad ass ways
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)
Bad ways (real bad ass ways)

[David] David Banner~! Big Face
[$hort] You wanna get paid?
[Too $hort]
You gotta keep tryin, just don't give up
Can't get on your feet cause you just won't get up
You dream about havin nice things but you don't have a plan
How you gon' get it, from your Uncle Sam?
Your welfare check can't buy a house and a Benz
What'chu wanna be, a mouse or a man?
You need a hustle, somethin that'll make some cash
Don't step on the gas, you're goin way too fast
In your new sports car, you're dreamin again!
Snap out of it - I know you're fiendin to win
You need to start from the beginnin, get a paper and pen
What'chu like to do, what's your favorite thing?
There's gotta be somethin you can do wit'cha life
Sell things that a whole bunch of people will buy
Make a lot of profits, make bank deposits
Wanna live like this, here's a shoe, how's it fit?
[Chorus: Too $hort] + (Banner)
How you gon' ball if you got no hustle
How you gon' pimp if you got no game (YEAH!)
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right cause you so damn lame (YEAH!)
Now how you gon' ball if you got no hustle
How you gon' pimp if you got no game (YEAH!)
How you win a fight if you know you can't tussle
Your life ain't right cause you so damn lame (YEAH!)
[David Banner]
Niggaz wanna play with they life but won't play with they kids
They'll ball for these hoes but won't invest shit
Go to church and pray to blue eyes, church is for them pew thighs
Supersized by fries, I pimp a lot of bitches
but I'd rather save yo' lives
I'm from a place where they hung black folks
Where a bird can be whipped from some raw AND dope
Now you broke cause you smoke and you don't got a job
Man get up off yo' ass and do just like Todd~!
Sell yo' shit up out the trunk
Stop hatin other niggaz you can get what you want
You can get what you need without makin others bleed
I'm the master of the P-U-S-S-E
Oops I meant Y, others gotta die
Just to help sorry-ass lames get by
Now you'll let a bird die if you saw a bush
But you're pussy in the hood nigga, come get douched
Yeah nigga!
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
When you finally start makin some dough
You gotta work a lot harder, way more than befo'
It ain't hard to get in, but it's hard to stay
When you start pimpin it's all night all day
Non-stop, gettin it, then you start kickin it
Out with some hoes, later on you'll be stickin it
Move forward and continue to do what men do
Gettin money cause it's in you
[David Banner]
Or maybe bein a man ain't in you, you BITCH
You can sell out your own just so you can get rich
No soul, no vibe, but you sportin a cross
Man the truth is you're tired and your spirit is lost!
I've been baptized in dirt, pull your panties up nigga
Rather shoot ya in your mind instead of blowin out your liver
David Banner, Mississippi until the day that I die
You can make it in this world, stand up nigga try

One thing's for sure...
You will get called a bitch... bitch
So motherfuckin' fast - bitch
Short Dog's in the house... beotch!
What's up bitch, you the cut up bitch
Fuck somethin' bitch, suck somethin' bitch
Look out bitch, watch out bitch
Yeah I fucked you bitch then got out, bitch
Catch out bitch, fuck that shit
Motherfucker gettin' mad, fuck that bitch
So bitch, pay me bitch
You can love me bitch, you can hate me bitch
Straight up bitch, save a bitch
Then pay a bitch, I don't play that bitch
Cause a bitch is known to get outta line
And a bitch don't understand, I'm on the grind
You lil' bitch, I'm all about the paper
When I leave bitch tell 'em all about a player
Go on bitch, c'mon bitch
Run home bitch, get front on bitch
That's right bitch, fuck off bitch
You get off bitch when you suck all them dicks
Get cut off bitch when I come home bitch
Shit ain't right? Get the fuck on bitch
Speak up bitch, say what bitch
Wanna pull me down, I'ma stay up bitch
So what bitch, do what you wanna do
A nigga like me don't want nothin' with you
I want a bitch, a real ass bitch
You can feel that bitch when she kill that grip
Hundred dollar bills bitch, I'ma still get a grip
And I won't feel shit when I get a new bitch
Lil' bitch, back up bitch
When I say you fine don't act a bitch
I'll slap a bitch, get smacked up bitch
Wanna get in my way when I stack up chips?

You know what?
A bitch is a once-a-month funky cock bleedin'
Bitch fell in love but she won't stop cheatin'
Real dumb with low self esteem
Fuck a nigga she just met and won't be able to see him
Later on when she wanna get fucked some more
I said ""Bitch, why you such a stupid hoe?""
You lil' bitch, you never could fuck with this
And every bitch that don't like it, she can suck my dick
20 years later, still settin' it off
Still talkin' bad 'bout them pregnant dogs
They ask me ""Short Dog, why you talk so bad?""
Bitch disrespect me, get off in her ass
I'm pullin' hoe cards (time to learn a lesson real quick)
Ask me, ""What's the definition of a bitch?""
A real bitch - she gon' know she one
Suck the dick, drink the nut, and say she owe me one
Damn bitch, you that bitch, can you do that bitch?
Move back bitch, say who that bitch... I don't know you hoe
I don't sniff cocaine, I don't want no blow
Bitch you a dummie - bitch, junkie
Bitch, funky bitch, punkass bitch
Jump out bitch, get the fuck out bitch, get cussed out bitch
Cause a bitch is known to get on my nerves
And a bitch don't really know when I'm on the swerve
I'm like ""Bitch, miss me"", ""Bitch don't kiss me""
""Bitch, just lick me bitch""
You's a bitch, knew it when I heard the beat
Bitch ain't nothin' but a word to me
I told you ten times, all she gon' get is pimp lines
I'm Short Dog -

Sheezee.. sheezee
(singer croons ""be my.. (be my) dirty love (dirty love)"" 2X)
Much love y'all
Short Dawg's in this
Verse One: Too $hort
I'm high profile, but you can't see me hoe
Got limosine tint like a real CEO
Hands free, talkin on the speaker phone
Handlin my business, just tryin to get my freak on
You know, bitches always beepin me with code 69
I'm real with mine, I make hoes wait in line
Can't fuck em all, and don't want to
Cause some of these tramps might front you (watch out)
You waited six months, I fucked her on the first date
And so I smoke the green weed to keep my mind straight
It's Friday, doin shit my way
Me and yo' bitch, rollin down the highway (right)
While you shootin that.. she gave it up easy
Fore-a-play and all that, wasn't tryin to tease me
Now you wanna feud, fuck that shit (slut)
Let's fight behind a lady, not that punk ass bitch
(singer croons ""be my.. dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Watch em.. keep your eyes open
Doesn't make sense
Verse Two: Too $hort
Now here I go, spittin another verse
Let the pen read my mind cause the shit ain't rehearsed
I'm so curious, about what this fat bitch have
A big bag of weed and a pack of zig-zags (smokin)
So I kicked it with her, with no intentions to fuck
Smoked up her weed and got my dick sucked (yeah right)
I said I got a lot of money but I'm short on cash
Could you give a nigga some so I can get some gas?  (stupid shit)
She gave me twenty dollars, I know it's small pimpin
But it's mandatory, when I deal with all women (all these hoes)
It ain't gon' be no one-sided, I support her shit
Just because she hurt, Too $hort got a grip, beyitch!
I break it down, like the beat
Ride you like a motherfuckin seventy-three
Old school, everytime I roll through
All you suckers know who all the bitches go to, Short Dawg
(singer croons ""be my.. dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Fuck a bitch.. they fuck with you main
Foul mouthed little motherfuckers.. ?
Verse Three: Too $hort
It's cause rap music is like sellin dope
Every dollar you invest you get seven mo' (and that's real)
I hope you never ask me, how much it costs
if you can't figure out how the fuck I floss (big ballin)
You better get in where you fit in
cause a nigga like me ain't kiddin (no jokes)
Here come her boyfriend, with that narrow minded shit
Kissin on the bitch, she sucked e'rybody dick (slut)
Don't get mad, you knew the bitch had flaws
Ridin in the Benz (bitch) dick hangin out my drawers..
.. now why she give me head?  (why?)
All she ever wanted was to get in my bed
I ain't gotta be a trick to tramp your hoe (nope)
I spit the game like a pimp while I'm ridin chrome
I had a dream I was through, can't sell records
Can't catch hoes, bring em home and get naked (what?)
It's not the first time, I had this dream
But music is my drug and I'm a dopefiend (straight)
The way I put it down, it don't seem too hard
Scorin points like Kareem-Abdul Jabbar (swish)
And if you tryin to catch me, you'll find out fast
what you tryin to do is an impossible task (can't do it)
Cause what I'm doin (can't do that) no rapper ever did it
(can't do that) Eleven albums and I'm still the shit, bitch!
(singer croons ""be my.. dirty love"" 2X while Short spits)
Can't do that.. nah nah.. ain't gon' happen
Old school Too $hort, that's right I said Too $hort

Let's go! The fuck up outta here

When I take off I peel out hard
I drive like a maniac
Keep the radio loud, and way in the back
These two hookers - feel the woofers
Don't worry, the cops won't book her
And you ain't gotta tip her
She's a call girl, she ain't no stripper
.. She's a dime
Stayin with me all the time
I'ma dip, pimp
Stop at the light and make the whip spin
Then step on the gas, step on the brake
Step on the gas, step on the brake
Show 'em how we ride

Put the pedal to the metal - GO!
Let's ride - GO!
GO! Beotch..
It goes down nightly
The town is so hyphy
Everyday it's on
When the sun goes down 'til the break of dawn
And when it's 'bout to start
Put the car in park
But don't pull to the side
Go dumb right next to your ride
It's more than a dance, it's a movement
You can tell cause the town be movin
You wanna know if it's worth it right
They do it all day but it's worse at night
We so hard when we swervin cars
We serve them hogs when we work them broads
So many pimps we'll turn ya mother
Put her in the front seat and start burnin rubber
GO! Put the pedal to the metal - GO!
Let's ride - GO!
Yeah, GO!
Burn rubber
I drive like the movie, serious
But this ain't ""Fast and the Furious""
It's what I'm goin through
Thick traffic, I'm on the morning news
Fast women, liquor and music
Wearin out tires, quicker than shoes bitch
Fast cars and the best of smoke
Pass that weed I don't mess with coke
.. But I fuck with Hope
She works for the service so I won't go broke
Now watch me serve it
The cops see me swervin
I did two donuts
That's when the OPD rolled up
But I ain't no joke
Got the pedal to the metal and I can't go slow
GO! I got the pedal to the metal - GO!
I'm burnin rubber - GO!
I'm yellin out BEOTCH - GO!
Let's ride

Whoo! Ah ah, ayahh, ahh ahh ahh
And you don't stop, ahh ahh, word is bond, word is bond
Now introducing the sound from the ghetto
E Double and Too $hort, what the fuck you thought?
I come with the ruckus, It's My Thing when I swing
I'm Born to Mack, always strapped, with the black gat
Who out there I swear boy wanna get touched
Roll up, and catch a slug to the chest, so DUCK
I talk the talk, walk the walk, now nigga
Five hundred S drivin with hand on trigger
Crazy Lestat, check my track record
Everything I touch is gold since eighteen years old
So what that mean? I roll the blunt
and puff the indo smoke in it, I trip in a minute
Crazy hoes be jockin me cuz I be rockin B
Sewin up like Monopoly, nobody's stoppin me
Dig it, Funkdafied like Brat, how's that?
I stick and move on tracks while I smoke a twenty sack
Who said the E can't rock? That's bullshit
Suck my dick and get a big fat lick of my balls
You wanna brawl? Punk I thought not
You might get beat down and stomped like Sasquatch
Your girl, like Keith Sweat, I wanna fuck her
Psych, I already stuck her
I got rhymes to make your whole head swell up
Here's an icepack homeboy shut the hell up
I rock the mic with Too $hort, y'all niggaz know what's happenin
Everything he touch goes platinum
Eyeeaaaah!
Verse Two: Too $hort
I made a half a million in a week
And every nigga on the street got a tape playin me
You can't believe it? Erick Sermon, rollin with $hort
Rolled from California all the way to New York
In big Benzes, G hooked it up
Now we trying to squash all that East/West stuff
We spent years in the studio makin funky tracks
Signed a bunch of niggaz with some tight ass raps
It's like Father Dom, it's like Keith Murray
Makin millionaires but it ain't no hurry
Cuz we all in it for the long run
I won't leave the studio until a song's done
And ain't nuthin really hard about gettin my cash
A big phat house with a million stash
You other niggaz got this rap game distorted
Givin DATs to the label, straight gettin shorted
Claim you're gettin paid, but I can't tell
You keep rappin in my ear got me mad as hell
You talk a good game but I don't believe in you
You smoke a lotta blunts but I got more weed than you
I guess I see you on the charts in the meanwhile
Another face in the crowd busting freestyles
Wishin you could be in the light
Promoters pay me ten G's just to breathe on the mic
Bitch! $hort Dawg puttin it down with the E Double
Verse Three: Erick Sermon
Shhhhh! You remind me of my phat gold chain
Some of y'all are just small change
Two of us with true true game
Yeah yeah
Dig this y'all, my Music is Dangerous
Atomic Dog, coming through the smog with $hort Dawg
Ahhh! Quick with the trig Jack be nimble
I shoot like G Mob goes liftin through my window
Chik chik pow! How you like me now?
The man in the mirror it don't get no clearer
$hort Dawg, the E Double, and Breed we roll thick
Like girls in C.A.U. with the good power-U
Owww! Money is the key to fame
So I can live it up with the girls on Soul Train
The impact, major league dough like Dave Justice
Yo Breed, $hort Dawg, show em how we bust this
Verse Four: Too $hort, MC Breed, Kool Ace
Like some true pioneers, don't forget it
Put the money on the table, let's split it
We got enough G's here to make us both happy
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
It's $hort Dawg the real pimp of the century
Girls get wet every time somebody mention me
I was known for my mackin back in eighty-four
I want it all, that's what I keep stackin for
Have things that a rapper never dreamed of havin
And I can tell them how to get it just keep rappin
Life's a battle, can't afford to lose son
So many ways to get paid, you got ta choose one
Now some of the ways to get paid out is runnin your mouth
That street life will keep me tight, I'm talkin bout
Gettin green, dolla dolla bills y'all
That's on the real, somethin you can feel y'all
Many claim to have game but you can get that on sale
But ain't nuthin they sellin to you but Arbor and Gail
I mean Sprinkle Me homey cuz I'm bout dollars and cents
And if you ain't haulin dollars well you ain't holler
in FlintI'd rather dip dip dive, so-socialize
Get loot from the Great Lakes, West to Eastside
Or tramp, trick, HACH I spit
On your grave if you ain't gettin paid like this
Afterhours at the ATM pays my way
Its Mr. Mack ""So hey are you still in the game?""
See I gets paid by the movement of the cut
I've been summoned by the counselor, to testify and bless
It's that, big mack, like scripture its a fact its that A-C-E
So hide your hoe from me
Southern am-bassador, knockin at your door
Leadin a click that's true, checkin knowin all fifty-two
See, all you tricks, best behave
It's that Southern nigga mack from the city of the Brave
I got a platinum car, yes yes y'all
So plant me with the green and them hoes and we can big ball
Yeah, now we rollin four deep
Double dosin, relaxin, and maxin Too $hort and these beats
E Double, $hort Dawg, Kool Ace
In the place, and we all but bring you straight horror
Representin money
Buy you some nigga

On the green and the purple, Never on the brown

Have ya flyin' real stupid like Dumbo
They love it when it comes from California
You'll never be an +Outkast+ with that +Stankonia+

Smell the aroma, Smells so lovely
Man thats potent, What ya'll smokin man?, Orange Ruffie
Where ya from, You from the Yay, Im from the Valley J
Man ya'll some fools, You California dudes do not play
I though you thoughtamajig, I though I told you my nagga
Game colder than a six pack of soda my nagga

Gettin rowdy in the Scrillacon Valley

Four boxes to the neck, Alcohol to follow
Get it on fa sho, Every zone I go
Tip toe to the door, Room 3-0-4
Put that town down-lo, Its that Town endo
Guarenteed, No seeds, In your town we'll blow

Now homie tell me what that yay like
Livin that Bay Life
We put it up in the air, From sundown to daylight
And the girls they be lovin' it, Cause it freeze on em
That Cali-O sensation lets us squeeze up in em
Its a whole 'notha mind state, A way of livin
That playalistic feelin' gives you the vibes of a villian
Help ya focus, And I was gone when I wrote this
Just trippin on that Cali-O, Its known to be the dopest
[Chorus with minor variations]
[Too $hort]
Its been 10 years since I moved from Oakland
I traveled everywhere but theres nobody smokin
Like the Bay and LA, From San Diego up Seattle's way
Aint no shake like a rattlesnake, That Budwiser make ya get smart
You say you went to San Francisco and left your heart
But dont leave that orange sunshine on the coast
I know that you think the green and the purple is the most
Out in Cali you get choices
One hit will have you hearin angel's voices
Make you wanna fly, And catch the next plane to the West
So you can fill your brain with the best
Now Mary Jane was a small town girl
But Cali-O, She's been all around the world
She'll make the coldest player go broke
You dont hear me though, That Cali-O aint no joke

Cain't hesitate to help the next man up
Pass the game like it's a hot potato

If you know somethin, teach it
Cause it makes no sense to keep it to yourself
That's how you felt
well you might feel better if you spread yo' wealth
Let it trickle down.. cause yo' crumbs
might be just enough for me to get some

but it's hard for a black man without a good woman

A good mother's gon' do anything for her kids
But you never kenw your father, he never bothered
Your last boyfriend used to grab you by the collar
for nothin, wasn't even tryin to get money
Fine woman like you, I don't find the shit funny
You need management, not an amateur pimp
who don't know what to do, when the money ain't cool
I'm a hustler, I always eat good
Fat house in the hood, new shoe on my foot
Things ain't been the same since he put you out
Somethin you ain't never felt good about
Let's get this money, that's what I want you for
Don't make me wait too long, cause life is too short
She said gladly, and then she had me
Jumped in my Caddy, and called me daddy

You tryin to convince yo'self it's the right thing
Once upon a time you had nice dreams
Now you don't sleep good, whatchu thinkin of?
Nobody cain't tell you how to get that love
It's right here, I know you understand me
I'll be your daddy, I'll be your whole family
No stress, never have to worry bout a thing
The best resteraunts, furs and diamond rings
All paid for by the suckers and lames
All you need is me in this motherfuckin game
To the top, that's where we goin
Where the good green don't stop growin
Don't ever turn on me
Give me everything you earn for me
Be together forever, never lonely
Smoke my last weed, a big fattie
Ride in my Caddy, and call me daddy

Tell her baby, no doubt, stick this dick in yo' mouth
I smoked a lot of weed, I said a lot of rhymes
Always fucked up in niggaz bitches all the time
Now I'm ridin on twenties wearin nice clothes
but ain't nuttin like pimpin hoes, and ridin Vogues
I live a good life, in my pursuit of happiness
I'm so glad, to get to the point of havin this
opportunity, for you and me to pass it on
Two years ago, I thought it'd be my last song
Me, Squeaky, Flex and J, on Saratoga Street
Smokin white boys, bumpin dopefiend beats
Eighty-eight, my pockets wasn't straight, but I was makin it
Niggaz like Lil' Tim was out there ballin sellin cakes n shit
I was right there, on the Mob Circle, writin raps
All about my snaps, tryin to put Ball and G on the map
Nowadays I own my shit and bone bad bitches
Kickin it with rich niggaz in rollers, and candy sixes
Deliverin hot shit like Pizza Hut for them hardcore thugs
Niggaz who pimp bitches and hit the highway with them drugs
Feel my flow, mix it in witcha chronic main
$hort Dawg, I don't know why you tryin to leave this game
State to state, plenty hoes and plenty money to make
Writing raps, makin more than them niggaz movin weight
The game been good to me, and I know that muhfucka bless you
Thanks for passin game, now let's get out here and make this loot
Chorus: Too $hort, Eightball, MJG
[TS] I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
[8B] We some presidential players, with money by the layers
[8B] Ain't nuthin you broke ass niggaz do that can fade us
[TS] I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
[TS] I got too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
[MJ] I drive fast cars, eat lunch by lakes
[MJ] and meet a hundred different bitches when I drop new tapes
Verse Two: MJG, Too $hort
I had to sacrifice, get things right
In this rap life, I paid my dues
Learn how to crawl, before I walk
Then I learned how to tie my shoes
Tryin crime, but it just didn't work for me
Matter of fact it did it worse for me
Gettin eyes scarred, bein weak one time ya hard
It can only do hurt to me
So I sucked up my peer pressure, and my pride
And realized that this rap shit was gon help me to survive
Stay alive, go with the flow but don't be no muhfuckin fool
Hell this music thing is all I got, I ain't makin straight A's in school
And ain't wind up to be dumber nigga, only to be different
So all the shit that you think we are, the shit that we isn't
When you raised up, where I come from, make it out is a blessing
Cause half the cats, where I come from, don't ever learn they lessons
My first love, even before I had a daughter, or a lady
was rappin, sweet lyrics, I love you, my baby
MJG, what you see, on TV, is fame
But the rapper I let loose almost anything, I love this game
I won't stop rappin, I don't stop rappin
I make too much money bitch I can't stop rappin
I live the fast life of a MC
and I sell a lot of records makin pimp beats
I could do a show tonight and make ten G's
Fuck til the mornin, sleep late and smoke weed
Three cars in my garage, truck in the driveway
I always, get my dick sucked on the highway
Verse Three: Eightball, MJG
My way (pimp til I dieee) fuck a hoe
Unless that hoe is breakin me off some dough, to hit the studio
Blowin, niggaz ain't knowin, how far this shit is goin
I wrote all my shit, but niggaz always talkin bout what I owe them
But I'm gon' show them, real niggaz stand on they own ten toes
So I'ma make all the money, and try my best to fuck all these hoes
Friend or foe, a bitch or hoe, rich or po'
Eightball got flow, MJG
Here comes the one they call the P-I, M-P, never will retire
The tree-high, green leaf, helps me to get higher
Eightball and MJG, Too $hort, we all must be
the pimps of the industry, shit people pretend to be
Fuck so why should we, settle down
Leave the kitchen put the kettles down
Stop from fillin all you hoes
Give up the life of trues and vogues
Hell no, it ain't gon' happen, this shit too deep
So I hooked up with my comrades so we can all get rich, nigga
Chorus
[8B] Yea yea, one time, for your motherfuckin mind
[TS] Pimp shit bitch
[8B] Eightball and MJG, now what you weigh me
[TS] $hort Dawg in the house, slammin Cadillac do's, pimpin hoes
[8B] Nuthin but the real shit, nine-eight, for these tricks it's too late
[TS] It's that old school pimpin all the way from Memphis, to Oakland
[8B] Straight smokin baby, fryin em up fat
[TS] Atlanta to Houston, we still doin it like this
[8B] Yea, New York to L.A.
[TS] Beyitch!
[8B] Hah, that's right, Space Age forever, nigga
[TS] T-Mix on the funk
[8B] Dangerous Music, uhh
[TS] Suave House
[8B] I love that!

Verse One: Too $hort, Eightball
From nineteen-eighty, through eighty-eight
I Don't Stop Rappin like my first tapes
When I was broke, I used to sell em instantly (instantly)
One look, you could tell it was the pimp in me (pimp in me)
In eighty-nine, I went on tour with Eazy-E (Eazy-E)
A bunch of fine bitches tryin to sleep with me

You know we ridin', yeah we ridin'
I got my nigga MC Breed in the house
Big Baller, what you ridin' boy, what you ridin'
[Hook]
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yaht, and some G's,
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Cant even tell you what I make a year
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yaht, and some G's,
Everything about you, thousand motto nigga, yeah
Cant even tell you what I make a year
[MC Breed] (Too Short)
(Spit it)
Max fold, the chef could be proffesional when rap is my colateral, for this cash flow
I got some candy paints sittin' on these
Platinum peices and some ho's from over seas
A mansion, a yaht, and some G's
To be respected for the past and the present
Uh, and show my ass at every session (yeah)
And sure enough, (what) I'm gettin' closer to my destin
(Nigga, Breed you ain't shit) No interuptions only testin'
(But I do) Uh, prove that I'm smooth with an aseditive
Bumpin' just a little bit better than my competitor
Hard you better than, you ain't gotta say it is
Everyday that's the way it is, keep it Manist
Back for some of that, Breed when the funk shit
All up in yo' ass and get cash yo' ass bump this
Bobb and weave MC's never could handle me
Thinkin' bout' changin' my name to Scandal-la, you follow
Now get the paper with my motto
Them niggas need to get in position and go on and hate me if you gotta
Gotta meal won't you have a plate, I'll have you wait
Go on and sit inside my Lincoln while I navigate
[Hook]
[Too Short]
Mackin' in my lac and when I stack em' in the back
I don't give them bitches slack, cause if she's in my Cadillac
She'll be giving up the crack tryna' get a niggas scratch
When she suck a million dicks the bitch'll get a platinum plack
I said BIATCH, that's what I said when I grabbed her pony tail and she was givin' me head
I said BIATCH, you know what's up I put my dick in my draws' and zipped my jeans up
And instantly; you finna' see how pimpishly, I get these ho's in the streets
You niggas killin' me; you ain't feelin' me the bitch got you burnin' smokin' penni-cillin-weed
Or dip yo' dick in some hennessy, you'll be a God damned fool if you listen to me
I tell you shit that you can't believe, I got the bad ass bitches and they stankin' free
[Hook]
[Too Short]
I told Breed these young niggas think we gettin' old
I seen em' gettin gas down on Cascade Road, still makin' money in these new days
Used to have sky pagers now we got two-ways
We dipped to my house and let the beat crank
So many placks on the wall you cant see the paint
But its loud, you know how wild your friends get
Ballin' so long been through three body styles and big Benz's
If I cut it, in the garage
I'll make the bitch think im the wizard of Oz
Click yo' heels three times you swear you seen magic
Now she's a star, she used to be a maget
Her pussy went platinum, thats what I heard
Like when I'm rappin, you never get enough of my word
I'm in my third decade of gettin paid to rap
Back in the day my tapes stained the deck
[Hook]
[Too Short]
This shit bumpin mine ain't it
Oh you gotta be riders if you wanna bum this Short dog shit
You can't be in no little bullshit ass car with no bullshit system
What you ridin' nigga, you got candy?
You got rims nigga?, yo' beat aint bumpin' nigga
This shit bumpin', turn that shit up, BIATCH!

Why..
Why..
I'm a junkie, lookin through my book
I can't be cured, I know I'm hooked
I gotta get out the house, I'm so hard
Chasin that cat all over the yard
But why, do I chase the cat?
Been at it so long since way back
Why would I wanna be a player for life?
Spittin this game every day and night
I'm talkin, body language, facial expressions
Fuck a flight attendant on a layover session
She's servin my dick
Fallin in love, but she ain't my bitch
Why do I need to be in between her
since the first time I seen her?
Hit it from behind, now she wanna be mine
I'm all up in her feline
[Chorus: Dolla Will]
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money
Why must I, chase the cat?
You see ain't nothin changed, but the game, pimpin ain't easy
[Dolla Will]
Uh, bein settled down, just ain't for me
Hold hands, walkin down the aisle, bout to get married
I thought that once, will never think it again
Cause I'm a player in the game and I'm playin to win
It's too many fine hoes to be stuck with one
Too many wet pussies just to be fuckin one, shit
It's like a disease, like JT in ""Five Heartbeats""
It's impossible for me to be with one freak
You can't live with me, you can't live without 'em
I never would trust a bitch and I don't doubt 'em
Cause I'm a dog that love to chase the cat
If you a fine bitch, I might put my face in that
If you do me first, then I'll do you
And the game jumps off when the bitch is through
Hoes nowadays be as bad as us
They love to suck fuck and bust fat ass nuts
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
Ever since I was a youngster, new to the game
I was goin to the mall, baby what's your name
and your number - I never been under
Always been a outright player no wonder
I been through so many hoes in the last 20 years
Bitch gettin fucked, bring her ass up in here
I keep two or three hoes on deck
Too $hort baby don't take no shit
I'm a pussy junkie, and bitches always want me
But my first love is money
And I'll forever be faithful to her
I won't give her to a bitch just to do her
And play with her kitty
Got some nigga's name tattooed on her titty
I see a gat and jump the fence
My name is $hort Dog and I'm a pimp, bitch
[Chorus: Dolla Will]
Why must I, chase the cat?
Cause you know.. she's a ho..
Why must I, chase the cat?
Whaddya know.. she gives me dough..
Why must I, chase the cat?
She got ghetto ways, plus she pays, give me my money

All you washed up hoes tryin to throw that P
You're just a big freak, you better not complain,
When you hear these cocktails and you hear your name.
If you a fake bitch, ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Janine.
If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'm gettin fucked in my drop top cadillac
I met this freak named Naomi
Straight dick sucker worked me and my homies.
She had a girlfriend, her name was Vicki
I pulled her to the side and let her suck my dick.
She was fine as fuck, but can't fuck with Tina
Tina, Tina, the sperm cleana.
I took her to my house and told her strip
Baby got freaky-started doing the splits.
I said, ""Bitch!!! Do what you want
Cause this true blue mack won't even front"".
I fucked her with my finger, she tried to cum
Pussy so tight, it wouldn't give me none
I'm Too $hort baby couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get freaky cause I love the funk
My dick is big and her nigga had a little one,
I didn't fuck her freaky ass, but it was still fun.
I know you stop and wonder just what it is..
It's the California lifestyle that I live.
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs.
I know this girl named Annette
Get her all alone and she'll suck your dick
Hella freaky...won't say no for shit
You and her all alone, nigga that's your bitch.
I know another freak her name's Joanne
I always get the pussy cuz I know I can
Finest bitch around, ain't got no man
Everytime she cross my mind I go fuck her again.
She's like another bitch named Christine
Bitch so dumb, I named her misdemeanor
Cuz it had to be a crime to be that dumb
I took her to my house and she let me cum in her mouth
You know I did all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me, I'm gonna call that bitch,
And go dig in them guts like a gardener,
If she starts screamin', I'm gonna fuck the bitch harder.
Cause these are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales I tell so well
You don't like my dirty rap you can go to hell
Cuz SAhort Dogg's on the mike tellin' cocktails.
I meet the groupies, hookers like Kathy,
Fucking M.C.'s cause she's so nasty,
See her backstage trying to throw that ass,
She just like the freaks and she had to pass me that pussy
You can't stop the bitch
Let her roll on my rolls then I drop the bitch
My name is Short my game is long
I freak these hoes and sing these songs.
I know another girl named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me
She really don't bring out the best in me
But I love her fine ass laying next to me.
She's like another freak named Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I fucked her so good she told her friend named Angie.
Angie called me up about two weeks later
Talking some shit about do me player
So I did her just like Tamara,
Taking naked pictures with my poloroid camera.
Next they told a girl named Rocquelle
Got my skin all under her fingernails
She was diggin in my back while I grind the shit
That was way back now I can't find the bitch
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break the bitch for everything cuz I came to pimp.
I'm Too Short baby, I don't stop mackin
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rappin
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be fucking em' up like that...BITCH.
I know another trick her name was Shery,
I had to cut her loose cuz she wanted to get married
Pussy so good and I do mean very...
SOmetimes it's shaved and sometimes it's hairy.
I'm Short Dogg ain't nothing nice
You ever make me mad and I'll fuck your wife
Have fun with your bitch and have her sprung on my dick.
I guess I'll pull it out and just cum on your bitch
Like my other little tramp named Erika
ANywhere I want to fuck that's where I fuck
Cuz she's the freakiest bitch in America
Everytime I get the pussy I just tear it up....
Cuz these are the tales the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
You don't like my dirty raps you can go to hell
Cuz Short Dogg is on the mike telling cocktales!!!!!!!!!

These are the Tales that I cherrish so well.
You don't like my dirty rap, you can go to hell
Cause Short Dog's on the mic spittin Cocktales.
Verse1: H - E - A - D
All you washed up girls tryin to throw that P.
You're just a big freak, you better not complain
When you hear these Cocktales and you hear your name.
If you're takin, it ain't no thing
I'll pick up the phone and call Janine.
If I call Marie, I know for a fact
I'll get worked in my drop top cadillac.
I met this freak -- named Naomi
Straight head doctor, worked me and my homies.
She had a best friend, her name was Vicki
I pulled her to the side and let her lick me.
She was fine as hell, but not fine and Tina
Tina, Tina, the dick cleana!
I took her to my house and I told her, ""strip!""
Baby got freaky -- started doing the splits.
I said, ""Tina, you can do what you want
Cause a true blue mack won't even front.""
I *** with my ***, she tried to ***
She was so ***, wouldn't give me none.
I'm sir Too $hort couldn't be no punk
I'm trying to get funky cause I love the funk.
Minus *** and her man had a little one
I didn't *** freaky ass, but it was still fun.
I know you stop and wonder what it is
It's the California lifestyle that I live.
Roll em up fat and take me a puff
And tell everybody about this freaky stuff.
I know this girl name Annette
Get her all alone and she'll do like this.
She'll freak you -- won't say no at all
Get her all alone and she'll have a ball.
I know another freak, her name's Jo Ann
I always like to *** cause I know I can.
Finest thing around, ain't got no man
Everytime she cross my mind, I go *** again.
She's like another freak named Christine
So damn dumb, I named her misdemeanor.
Cause it had to be a crime to be dumb
I toll her to my house and she let me cumm
In her mouth -- You know I work all in tip
She got my number, if she beeps me, I'm a call the trick.
And go diggin them gutts like the gardener
If she starts screamin, I'm a hump a little harder.
chorus: Cause these are the tales, the Freaky Tales
These are the Tales that I cherrish so well.
You don't like my dirty rap, you can go to hell
Cause Short Dog's on the mic spittin Cocktales.
verse2: I meet the groupies -- hookers like Cathy
Fuck a MC cause she's so nasty.
See her backstage tryin to throw that ass
She's just like the freaks, so she had to pass
Me that funk -- You can't stop this
Just let her roll on voes and drop her quick.
My name is Short, my game is long
I freak these freaks and sang these songs.
I know another girl named Stephanie
Do anything she can to have sex with me.
She really doesn't bring out the best in me
But, I love her fine ass laying next to me.
She's like another freak name Nicole
So damn sprung on my diamonds and gold.
I took her to my house, she gave me the panties
I dicked her so good, she told her friend name Angie.
Angie called me up about 2 weeks later
Came by the house and said do my player.
So, I dicked her just like Tamara
Taking naked pictures with my polaroid camera.
Next they told her friend name Rocquelle
Got my skin all under her fingernails.
While she was diggin in my back, I was dickin it
That was way back when, now I can't find the trick.
But if I do, I'll probably do the same again
Break her ass for everything, cause I came to pimp.
I'm Too $hort baby, I don't stop mackin
I grab the microphone and I don't stop rappin.
You can bet your life as I spit these raps
I'll be funkin em up like that..... BITCH

Now.. I come from the Oakland town
Task force roll and rock, cold cracked down
Young brothers my age making dollars so long
Drive a brand new Benz with a cellular phone
See him draped in gold, we call him Big Bank Bob
Got a ring for each finger and he can't get a job
Call him trash, he supplies for the dopefiend's tweak
But what you make in a year he might make in a week
Cold cash money is the answer to life
Feedin fat hovers to a dopefiend's pipe
Gotta keep rollin, just can't stop
Only two worries are a thief or the cops
People keep sayin: it's all so wrong
But the rocks roll strong all night long
Another Park Street life, the age old story
And now the coke dealers take all the glory
They're the ones you meet big time on the street
I say the coke dealers are now the elite
See, the average dopehouse will take your soul
Trade it for a rock and do the same with your gold
But if you think about it really it all sounds silly
Smoked out Willie in his washed off Philly
Open up shop down the block
And everybody's tryin to get a piece of that rock
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin
Coke
[ VERSE 2 ]
Cocaine the demon, it knows you well
Sellin you a trip to a place called hell
You never even thought you'd get hooked
Starin in the mirror, scared to look
You think about life and think it's cold
Like drivin with a ???? down a rocky road
Now the rock man is your best friend
The only one you talk to time and again
You even tried dealin, but that's no fun
Before you made a sale it was in your lungs
So the coke dealer now lives on your life
Like a four year marriage you're the man's wife
You can hate it with a passion, but you won't fuss
He's the driver of a Caddy and you're ridin the bus
You think it's not fair, I tell you it is
Cause he bought yours and you bought his
Bought his cars, his clothes, and he bought the coke
Now he looks good and you look smoked
It doesn't take much to realize
All you gotta do is just open your eyes
You're cold bein pimped by a rock in some glass
What's it gonna take before you fall on your ass?
Bankrupt, smoked out, just simply through
Cold street walkin with a hole in your shoe
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin
Cokeland
[ VERSE 3 ]
I once had a homeboy rollin strong
Sold coke all day and all night long
He made a lotta money and bought a lotta stuff
But soon he went broke and it didn't take much
First he started smokin, and all that he figured
Was the more he sold dope, you see his bank got bigger
But my homie thought wrong cause he could be stopped
The vice squad rolled and the boy got popped
He was out on bail before he made it to jail
Wasn't about to do time when he's doin so well
Say he had a lotta money and some real good friends
But he was almost broke when he flipped again
So he got on his grind, he wasn't wastin a day
Opened up shop and started pumpin the weight
He thought about the boys that he could not pay
So he hustled by himself thinkin that's okay
But one night he was chillin with a freak named Carol
His door was kicked in and he was starin at a barrel
The brother with the gun saw him tweak on the base
Walked right up and put the Uzi in his face
He said, ""Give up the dope if you still wanna breathe
I tell you one time, you better listen to me""
As my homie got robbed he lost the fight
And now he's just a smoker probably totin tonight
Coke dealers
Yeah, I'm big time, baby
Smokin
COKE!
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Coke dealers
Big time, baby
Smokin
The City of Dope
Cokeland
Smokin
It don't stop

No hater can fade me
I was short like the rest of y'all half stepping little dicks wanna be big
willie's, you got a bad case of the sillies
In the studio you make believers
In real life you more like the cape crusaders
Rushing to the scene to save them hoes
Everytime they come across them crazy folks
You cuff 'em hurry up and get em' to safety
But sooner or later the bitch gotta face me
Cause I put the game down from the start
And you ain't nothing but a dumb ass mark

Say hoe
yeah you
Can I ask you a question
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don't want me to talk to you like that
Will you like to make love?
I saw you walking down the street, and I  had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and your so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I'm a mack, I cold turn you out
I wont ask, and I sure won't beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it, don't watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I'm the man
I take you out to the finest resturant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose
But later on you're coming off with them panyhose
You want gold, girl whats next
It's me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I'm just a freak
Give it up baby, I can't wait two weeks
I want it all, Don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't
-girls voice-
Nigga please, you provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you $hort because of your height or your weight?
Diss me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigga, the kind you don't take home
???? tights and Barbie from the dangerous zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...
-Too $hort-
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigga in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you dope or sell you blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...
-Girls Voice-
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming, and scheaming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough, for you I feel disgust
Wait, small thing I hate
For goodness sakes, if I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me shows your bodacious behavior
I have to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step you to my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Jealous of  you got some, nigga please your lying
Cause I fight the feeling, that would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...
-Rappin 4 Tay-
I am the rapper that they call 4 tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't body tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a black girl it really don't take too long
but a white girl's always tryin to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give her some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
coming to my house in a camisole
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, it's time to unwind
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me numb...
-Too $hort-
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way to real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank hoe
Go get your bank hoe
My little dick'll have you screaming though
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I can't really say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!!

Walked in the house and got shot in the head
I know you don't believe it, if you do you're wrong
How can I die and rock it all night long?
I'm Too $hort baby, spit that rap
I put Oakland, California on the map
It's so hard, got you telling lies
Can't hold me back so you say I died
It's incredible, I came back to life
I never let 'em bury me without my mic
I keep breathing, don't stop that breath
Now everybody's talking about Too $hort's death
Am I a zombie, or something close?
I'm not Casper, I mack all the ghosts
Oaktown style is the only way
I catch a new freak every day
It's not the Yellow Brick Road, it's called the Foothill Strip
Stand on your toes, make your heels go click
Three times, it's no place like home
So why you wanna bury me all alone
I bring a new meaning to underground rap
Dead or Alive, I'm still Born to Mack
Always on the pop charts, straight rapping
I'm not dead, I'm just macking
So as the word turns, I'm a living soul
I even heard a rumor that I overdosed
I'm not a reincarnation of something old
Like King Tut I was buried in gold
Why you wanna cry when I'm still living?
Word got out and the rumors started spreading
My momma, called one night
Said ""Todd, are you all right?
The whole family's got the Too $hort blues
I heard it last night on the evening news""
And that's bad, it's not even true
I told my momma like this ""Let's sue""
So many times, I heard I died
I guess I'm like a cat and I got nine lives
Well I'm the P-L-A, Y-E-R
I lay bunnies, like Hugh Heffner
I'm her flavor, kinda saucy
I lay back and let the young freak toss me
Even if she don't like serving a pimp
I'm still living, so let's do it again
I keep rapping, hard as hell
Cause your rumors make my records sell
If you continue, I'll soon be rich
Riding around town going ""Biiiitch!""
People always say ""Too $hort can't rap""
Now I drive a Benz and my bank is fat
It's like crap, put a ""c"" on a rhyme
Ain't nothing left homie but a scandalous crime
I'm the best damn rapper you could ever hate
Say I died on the freeway in the earthquake
Say I'm washed up, say I'm through
But the fact still stands I'm better than you
You got rhymes? Well I got more
I take you on a trip to my rappin' store
You find rhymes and raps, poems and caps
Way more raps than any rapper could rap
Cause if you rap like me, he wouldn't have to be
Weak on the mic like my boy MC
It don't stop, to the funky beat
I know you like dancing with a real big freak
I can't dance, but I sure can rhyme
I sold a million, in '89
And if you didn't know baby, it's the 90's now
Old Short Dog got a new breakdown
I went to Miko's, fresh candy paint
Now I'm doing things that the suckers can't
If I was dead, they'd call it ""Dead Man's Rap""
But on the real, Short Dog is back
Funk funky, off the Parliament
I'm still living, so let's do it again
It's incredible, even if I die
I never let 'em bury me without my mic
I bring a new meaning, to underground rap
Dead or alive, I'm still Born to Mack
I say ""What's up"" to my homies in Santa Rita
Right about now I know you need a
Too $hort rhyme to get you through the day
Oaktown style is the only way
I came up, and now I've sworn
To rock this mic til I can't no more
And that's game, straight pop the most
MC rapper from the West Coast
Too $hort, dead or alive
I still chill on the Eastside
Cause I remember how it all began
House parties in East Oakland
Now it's on the pop charts, still rapping
I'm not dead, I'm just macking

Can't live without her - but you doubt her

{Just want you to love me back}
I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that you should've stuck a knife in my back
[Too $hort]
Now bitch I don't slang no crack
I can't go back to rappin' in my cango hat
You wanna put a little game on that?
How lame is that?
You fuckin' with the same ol' rats
We all have ups and downs
You're stuck with frowns and don't make a fuckin' sound
But let a nigga hit the lotto
Pop some bottles and tell everybody you got 'em
Now I done been on both sides of the mountain
For the bottom to the top and back down again
And all the way I give a hoe a fit
Not to wear it but to ??? little lonely bitch
You cryin' like a baby need a pacifier
You (pass a fly?) watchin' life pass you by
You couldn't make it to the top in an elevator
You think I want a sorry bitch?
Never player
[Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing]
[Too $hort]
You're like a little baby with a shitty butt
You city sluts they say you can't get it up
And then they say you're way too hyper
Game is lighter need someone to change your diaper
But don't stop just give it all you got
Till you're hot even if you slang dope and get caught
It's like goin' platnium and gettin' dropped
You don't get no money you get props
But you're not cuz you're really just dreamin'
I'm leavin'
I keep these fake hoes steamin'
They screamin'
She better face those demons
It's fuck season
Don't waste my evenin'
I believe him when he said the end was near
It's in the air a whole lot of pimps in here
I can't (com)pare cuz I've been mackin' twenty four years
But since you wanna go there bitch I really don't care
[Chorus with Too $hort and lady singing louder]
{Why you wanna treat me like that?}
Bitch don't know how to act when she's dealin' with a mack
{Why you gotta be like that?}
I can't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{Just want you to love me back}
Bitch I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Baby please don't act like that}
It's like that bitch stuck a knife in my back
[Too $hort talking and lady humming/singing]
It's like that
That's why I treat you like that
{Don't act like that}
Bitch x2
{Why you wanna act like that?}
(Get) the fuck on
{Baby please don't act like that}
{Oh no}
Better learn the rules of the game
{Don't act like that}
You don't know how to act when you're dealin' with a mack
{Don't act like that x2}
I ain't givin' no bitches no kind of slack
{No}
I can't love you cuz you're nothin' but a rat
{Why you gotta be that way?}
It's like that
Bitch it's like that
{Don't act like that}
{Oh no}
Bring me that VSOP
Passion blend
With a drop of yak

Yeah you know, we always tryin to get this money, that's what we do
It ain't easy.. but I'm tellin you, it ain't hard either
All you gotta do is keep hustlin man, don't ever give up
I don't care what it is, handle yo' biz
Forget about the woulda, coulda, and if I did's
Cause that's just the past, you know it never lasts
And you know how time flies by so fast
Look at rap music, they said it was a fad
But now it's takin over, and I'm so glad
Cause I never stopped rappin, but that's what I do
If you quit yo' thang, you might never find the truth
I had choices in life, I coulda did somethin else
I did what I wanted to, I did it for myself
Now whatcha gon' do with yo' life
People try to tell you what to do, it's yo' life
You better make the most of it, live to the fullest
Think positive and don't dwell on the BULLSHIT
I can't tell you no better
If you thinkin 'bout quittin, don't ever
[Chorus: Too $hort]
Don't ever give up, I know it ain't workin
It's been a long time, you never stop tryin
But you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up
Don't ever give up, give it all you got
It only gets better, never say never
You know you can't quit, you gotta keep goin
You already knowin, you can't give up, you just cain't!
[Too $hort]
Comin up is hard, givin up is easy
You always get the game from your homey Too Sheezy
I keep it so real, never spit it false
I hope you make it big and if you ever fall off
Remember these words, it's only what you make it
Anything is possible you want it better take it
I ain't talkin 'bout stealin, felonies'll ruin it
Stupid all I'm talkin 'bout is takin opportunities
Doors open up and when you get another chance
Either hold up the wall, or get out there and dance
It's on you, do what you wanna do
You know why everybody always punkin you
Talkin shit they know you're bluffin, won't do nothin
Sittin on the shelf like Stove Top Stuffin
I know you had enough and want to call it quits
Believe me, this ain't it
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
Isn't hard to see, use your eyes
It's time to tell the truth, cause we through witcha lies
Utilize all your steppin stones, gotta be prepared
Sittin 'round dreamin how you bout to be a player
The years and the time fly, you ain't even workin
Went by overnight you went from 18 to 30
Nothin goin on, never set a goal
Dreams can't come true, and now you gettin old
You start to represent, everything you hate
But don't give up, cause it's never too late
All you need is a plan, a purpose and a motto
And quit livin life like you 'bout to hit the lotto
Get rich on your own, buy a new home
Keep your real friends, leave them haters alone
I see you when you get there, rollin to the bank
I know you cain't let go, I know you cain't
[Chorus] (minus first ""don't"")
[Too $hort]
Nah we can't give up, gotta keep hustlin for life baby
It's hard on the black man, tryin to get my stack together y'know?
Big thangs..

I'm the young emcee that don't rap too long
Everytime I spit a rap is a brand new song
Always coming that fresh is so cold
You wouldn't have time to look at my world
Cuz you be dancing to the beat having a ball
Then I'll tell you to give me a call
I'm Too $hort baby I always say
When I'm rapping to the beat I don't play
I'm on the up and up so for real
Rapping that rap realer way real
Working that suckers everyday striving to be hard
Stacked with bean pies in the back of the car
Playing Too $hort in your stereo
I couldn't even hear your radio
Cuz just can't quit it short done took it
Found it like a tag ain't nothing but amusing
Just being short you think I'm small
But eye to eye I stand too tall
I make not make sense but I make mail
The beat don't stop and I just can't
Keep on going and I just won't stop
Too $hort over don't even stop
That's how I am that's how I jam
Just don't stop rapping when I regress
Being a rapper ain't everything
They madder now lost they change
On the short watch the cops say let's got
Raps to raps rocks to rhyme
So many raps all the time
Making raps everyday and still can see
The dope with a ride won't come to me
I spit raps every week of the year
Rapping on the mic just screaming snitch
My homie T rocks came hit me up
Went in the studio came hitting it up
Always catching the flash out of the cap
No hoes its all straight rap
No breaks no fakes just straight man T
And I always know what to do
The girl the other day just block up
Too $hort baby might just walk up
To me and she had to act Too $hort sews the rap
When I told baby all yes I am
We were walking down the street holding them
She said Too $hort spit that rhyme
And next thing you know that freak was mine
Girls going wild seeing female funk
Riding in the cut just hugging the back
Call me short and the girls I play
Love Too $hort when you hear me say
Girl that's your life
Girl why you smoking that hype
To the girls girls all the girls
Real long hair or short curls
Here's to you a special toast
Its all about you cuz I'm the most
If you hold it down let me hear you rap
Fresh to the beat don't even stop
Everybody on the mic or the floor say Too $hort
Suckers don't know that rapping game
Spitting on the mic can't even hang
With these sucker emcees every check
Rapping like this they will soon begin to realize
That rap is made to be tamed and ticked rush released
To the rap

Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
Everybody talkin bout they gettin hated
All these lies is bout who they been datin
If you never was a player, I cain't hate you
You know life is one time, you cain't take two
You seem to think cause you ain't fuckin mo'
that some other nigga's all up in yo' hoe
It ain't yo' fault, did you do that?
You think yo' ex-bitch, gon' ever take you back?
Hell naw, you still thinkin you a player
You only got one girl;
you just a square from nowhere
You starin at the ground, fuck the ceiling
Love is the word that describes yo' feelings
You're hooked, you can't leave her alone
You're like O.J., wait til he brings her home
You wanna kill her, but you don't wanna play the fool
You never was a player, we cain't hate you
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
What you mad at?  Your bitch let me have that
and I ain't even say shit about your fat ass
She chose me, don't get an attitude
It really ain't got nuttin to do witchu
I'ma fuck her - anytime I wanna
Like a dog, I'ma climb up on her
She don't sweat me bout my other broad
but you called her on the phone and said I'm just a frog,
I beat up hoes and I'm a rapist
Then you told all your homies how I hated
Damn nigga!  I don't even know you
I seen you actin like a groupie at a show or two
I know she knows, the way you lied
Last time I hated it was 1985
I was young, caught up with a bad bitch
I took my time, learned the game, I had to have the shit
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)
But what if you ain't no player?
She said you had a little dick, and can't fuck
Other niggaz fuck her good, but you ain't up
Can't do that stuff with a freak, can't never be weak
cause a nigga like me'll put a dick in her cheek
And to the beat, I start humpin on her face
Grab her by the ears and then give her a taste
Yeah nigga, I fucked her and she's mine now
You know I been a dog for a long time now
But I ain't gon' fight you for this pretty hoe
You think somebody player hated, you don't get it though
Just can't figure it out, and you never will
Your bitch went out and found her a better deal
Said it was cool, kickin it witchu
but she has more fun when she's lickin on dude
I hate to be rude, but you know the rules
Life is the game nigga - you lose
Don't hate the player nigga, hate the game (3X)

From the day we met up until we met right now
If I wanted that girl I always knew how
To fight her get her and tear her apart
Getting everything I wanted all I want
Everytime I see her its time to toss
I walking in the door taking everything off
Cuz I know I'll get it call her in a minute
Short oh boy and I'm a tone cold playa
She was mine and more but more came more
She was giving that funk to the homeboy short
Wanting money but maybe it was just the fact
The life I live made me the man of the rap
Everytime I see her you know I take her
Straight to her house then I braker
If I don't see break she'll give me a call
Same ol' freak show having a ball
Breakdown
She's a tender a star and Angel in white
My wildest dream on a saturday night
My freak of the week but girl of the day
If I like it like that it will be that way
Now everytime I see her she be doing it slow
Like ninty on shorty in a big time room
She's the one I can't resist
Everytime I see her I tell her like this
Breakdown
She be coming around the mountain around ten till eight
Hook me up on a late night date
I be right there homie opening the door
Singing baby oh baby are you ready for more
Everytime I see her you know what I mean
Had her in the back doing sexual things
Same ol' freak show all them moves
Call me short homeboy and I just can't loose
Tone cold freak dressed in lace
The hottest young tender in the whole dang place
Hottie so hot I keep telling myself
I want the young tender if you read this
At lyrics dot astraweb dot com that means
This was bitten didn't waste one second
To take a chance
I walked up to her and asked to dance
Baby said yes we hit the spot
My rap came hard and the freak got hot

Too Short:
Say hoe
yeah you
Can I ask you a question
You like to fuck?
Oh, you don't want me to talk to you like that
Will you like to make love?
I saw you walking down the street, and I had to stop
Turn up the radio and drop the top
I see you look so good, and your so fine
Young tender, would you be mine
I get you in my car, drive you to my house
Cuz I'm a mack, I cold turn you out
I wont ask, and I sure won't beg
Reach right over and rub your leg
I let my hand slide between your miniskirt
Slip a finger in your panties, straight go to work
What time is it, don't watch the clock
Lay back baby doll and I'll rock the cock
Funky Fresh I am, and I always can, Freak Nasty
I'm the man
I take you out to the finest resturant
Buy you any damn thing that you want
You want flowers, I'll buy your ass a rose
But later on your coming out them pantie hose
You want gold, girl whats next
It's me and you, doing the sex
So now you know I'm just a freak
Give it up baby, I can't wait two weeks
I want it all, Don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't . . .
-girls voice-
Nigger please
You provoke no feeling
You must of forgot, the girls of whom you're dealing
We haven't the urge, to get busy
Like those dizy lizys, who used to dance for you, your through
I can't put it more blunt, your vocab is restricted
You're addicted, to the words you inflicted
Time after time, line after line
Talking bout the bitches that are on your mind
Do they call you short, because of your height or your width
Dis me boy, I'll hang your balls from a cliff
Wrapped around a slinky, your a dinky
It's an easy task, to the corner cause the curb didn't want your ass
Your name is yuck mouth, you don't brush
Gotta cover your mouth like this
They call you yuck mouth
You refuse to brush, no sweetheart you can keep that kiss
Your a freak with no tale
You have no ass, class,you can't pass, your simply trash
Your a typical nigger, the kind you don't take home
scissor tights and Barbie from the dangerous zone
Like a short dogg that carries fleas
You make my ass itch, twitch, don't you wish you could scratch it
And grab it like you want it
The name fits cause your all up on it...
-Too $hort-
Get mad if you want, I won't front
When it's time to hump, won't be no punk
Roll your ass over and tap the butt
Too $hort baby all in them guts
I'm not your ABC, from the alphabet
Every letter I'll write'll get your pussy wet
It's just a freaky note, from me to you
At the bottom I signed it Playboy II
I'm a player, bitch, I thought you knew
Like every other nigger in my crew
I bump hoes, now it's your turn
Tell me young tender when will you learn
I cold mack like pimps you know
Won't sell you though, or sell your blow
Just your average everyday straight bump up bitch
My gold rings come from spitz
Look baby, You know what I want
Your acting like it's that time of the month
Are you bleeding, can't think about sex
Irritated by your Kotex
We don't need to kiss, we don't have to fuck
I'll pull out my dick bitch, you can suck
Now here, don't say I won't
Get it girl, now I'm telling you don't...
-Girls Voice-
Punk I'm not a tease, I'm not a skeezer
And most definately, not a dick pleaser
You dreaming ,and sceeming, and fiending for my lust
You don't have enough
For you I feel disgust
Wait, small things I hate
For goodness sakes, If I wanted someone small I would masturbate
I'm not talking 'bout your height, weight, or what you dream
When I say too short, you know what I mean
You see, I need man, not a boy to approach me
Your lame game, really insults me
Your name is Too $hort, or shall I say too skinny
If size were money honey, you wouldn't have a penny
Little boy, your not a player
I'm your savior
To try to get at me, shows of gracious behavior
I have to sit on my feet to come down to your level
Your mother should have hung you, from her umbilical cord
If she would have known your mission
Okay little boy, here's a proposition
You wanna bit of danger, Step you to my zone
You call yourself a dogg, thatz how I'll send you home
With your tail between your legs, screeching and whining
Jealous of you got some, nigger please your lying
Cause I fight the feeling, that would have to be one
And mathmatically, me plus you equals none...
-Rappin 4 Tay-
I am the rapper that they call 4 tay
I'm gon tell you like my homie Short Dogg would say
Hoes in the world, trying to play it sweet
Knowing damn well that they wanna freak
Some do this for maybe a week
And then it's cool to get up under the sheets
Trying to work that thang, but she said no
That's about as far as it's going to go
So I toss and turn, to make it loose
Finally she feels the act right juice
Some of you hoes say, oh that's nasty
Back of your coat say sweet and sassy
24 deep, that's how you sleep
Undercover freak every day of the week
You see some of you freaks just need to quit it
Playing that role like you ain't with it
The rest of you freaks just won't admit it
Especially when you know just who can get it
Ain't body tripping cuz I know I'm right
You could be black or you could be white
For a (low bass) girl it really don't take to long
But a (low bass) girl's always trying to turn ya on
With a little squeze, but it's just a tease
Give it some time, she'll be on her knees
Then I'll pick her up, so I can work the butt
Baby, I just wanna try to bust a nut
But don't get me wrong, cause you started it all
Coming to my house in a Camasol
But when it's time for me to shove
Then you front on all that love
First you said that I deserve it
Now you fight, don't want to serve it
Gave it some time, so make up your mind
Don't fight the feeling, this time to unwhine
You was talking 'bout you gunna give my some
But I'm Rappin 4 Tay it don't make me numb...
-Too $hort-
Yeah man, the little hoes got ill
So now it's time to get way to real
I know they never have some real dick
They need to quit talking that childish shit
You wanna rank hoe
Go get your bank hoe
My little dick'll have you screaming though
Because when it comes to sex, you don't know what's up
Your still playing that finger fuck
See I'm a grown man
I bust some young cock out
I like big butts, not big mouths
I know some little girls'll break you down in bed
Pull your drawers down, give you some head
But little girl, you wanna have some fun
You better go to magic mountain cuz your way too young
So at this point, I can't really say shit
Ain't dropping no lines, I'll just call you a bitch...Beyotch!!!

The tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I soked her pans
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, If you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twinsister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I geed this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spitted that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespine
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janie
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I wanna big freak, fat and slobby
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this girl, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a pitty little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more:
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Ren`
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Ren`, you can have it your way...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named aunt Winell
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I  knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin'
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, she cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shane, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shane is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her off like I'm lookin' a toy...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
The tales that I tell so well...
Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Nina and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was Roseanne
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shanie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a datewith girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volvos
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pimp house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to poem it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my neval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the mic and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this: they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...

The mother fucking funk seesion is about to begin
Crowd around, ladies and gentlemen crowd around
The funk session is about to begin
When I say funk session, I ain't talking about george clinton
I love that nigger though
I ain't talking about james brown and sly stone
I'm not talking about mother fucking the time and prince
(what you talking about? )
We talking about funk session 96 style
96 funk mean a different thing
That means you looked at my woman, and I'm stepping to you
And you about to pull out the gat and try to blow a nigger's brains out
Too short:
You see we can't along cause we just don't want to
You cross the game and my crew will just stomp you
And sing the ripper, we just say oh well
And the white man keeps on building more jails
I know the system ain't nothing to fool with
Cause you locked up all my homies that I went to school with
And I know damn well you got my name on the list
Cause I'm the one that called your daughter a bitch
Just a black man doin good, you wanna do me
Before you ban rap you need to ban them violent movies
Gangsta rap causes crime, mike tyson wrecked the system
Larry hoover ran a gang in illinios can't forget
Malcom x taught us knowledge, martin luther preached for peace
And every day black men lying dead in the street
So where's the real education, in the hood
Peace to the muslims cause they're doing real good
They're never giving up, on the black folks
We need to buy our own land and try to stack dough
Get rich if you want to, I ain't trying to front you
If robert gold want some funk tell him come through
It's been a long night but we're still getting funky
Who opened up the cage and let out the monkey
I heard it when she said it, ""you just a dogg short
Like them g's out in south side chicago""
I said that's right hoe, I'm from the east o
And I will never spend my money on a six-fo
High performance, is what I'm riding
I got the game from oakland so I never stop siding
I'm getting money in this criminal's country
Hoe's show me love because my pimping's so lovely
I'm not a role model, unless you trying to mack her
Cause first I am player and second I'm a rapper
Third I'm just a big ass baller
Top notch on my beeper but I still won't call her
Cause I got one with me, and I'm a pimp till I die
Don't be talking to them snitches, you'll get sent on a lie
Doing time in the pen for some backstabbing
I wonder what would happen if they catch em
You burn his balls with a big lighter, get the gasoline
And he'll be smoking like a mother fucking dope fiend
Nowaday's they like to kill your whole crew
For coming to the party and stepping on a shoe
He said excuse me, but it wasn't al-right
So now you want to take his punk ass outside
So you can hit him, and with him
Let his momma bury him in a suit that don't fit ?em
You don't give an f-u-c-k
So just fuck him
Didn't have to shoot him, just walked out and stuck him
Knife up and down all around in his gut
Standing in his blood looked down and said ""what's up? ""
What's up nigger, shock g tell ?em like treach
Shock g:
East coast niggers are the craziest
And west coast niggers are the craziest
And down south niggers are the craziest
It seems like all american niggers are the craziest
It done got out of hand
We don't drink that potion at the white mother fucking masses
Immediate and cooked up for us and now we killing each other
Remember me all, I want everybody to look back
Yo this is shock g from digital underground
I want you to look back right now
We rolling with the dangerous crew
I want you to look back when I said
Y'all remember that shit when I said, I said ah
America, get busy humpty yeah
The red the white the blue and the blue and red for crips and bloods
The white for whose got you doing time
We busting caps on one another and it never stops
You know it never stops
But you know, that shock's been searching for someone
Who can rise like malcom and farahkan
To straighten you niggers out
Shit they call me mc blowfish
Back when digital underground first started
Say, I was running the whole thing, say
The call me mc blowfish hey
Yeah, and I kick a little thing like this
I say, I say, I say, I say
Shorty check me out
I say, I say
Now follow as I slip into that butter melody
This is the part shock takes your heart and leaves you vision blurry
So try to focus on my dope
I suggest that you invest in a telescope
As I come with hella rythem
Move closer to your television
Get your look just like that hooker catch jay ism
Even with my vocals for your ears, you still couldn't see me though
As I flavor rub this vidy like oregano
I'm slanging them nouns and verbs
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I guess I'm just a little different cause I do love them hoes
Just maybe not the same way I love my niggeros
Cause I love it when they say something fly
The ill caps make me laugh till I cry
Some frys and some freaks and it's on
All night long
I love to see my homies living strong
But then that cook with that cloudy cookbook
Rains salts on another brother's sunny day
I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely g game we play
I said I'm wondering if we're really happy here with this lonely g game we play
Cause it's hella fun here, I'm not going to front on that
Yeah, niggers have booming fun
Flossing and fucking with these hoes and capping niggers
But wheres we heading as a people
Where is we heading
This is the funk session y'all
Check me out
This is shock g from d-flow production squad
Cooling right now with the dangerous crew
Yeah I got my man breed in the house
Breed bought to roll a fatty while my man shorty b get on the 6 string
And blow your mind, yeah
I got pee-wee in the house
And you know what pee-wee said
He said, he said shock, you know that...(fade out)

Yeah (niggaz desperate to be) nationwide baby
(But don't really know what it means to be)
A new millenium (a real true G)
Niggaz say, there's gotta be a whole different crew on the set
(Gangsters live and gangsters ride)
Just to rearrange the whole game (it's hard to survive, either do or die)
And that's what my niggaz is doin (in this gangster life)
That's what we doin, come check us out, yo
[Verse One]
Us young niggaz came up with nothin but hopes and dreams
Obscene intentions, picture perfect for the pinchin
A new invention to this dope game, I'm slangin CD's
instead of cocaine, meanwhile takin it in and gainin mo' game
My background descended from the hustlers and pimps
True redemption for you niggaz, I blew up like the blimp
Strong attempts to make these power moves, nationwide we devour crews
My momma told me never follow fools
[Verse Two]
On the backstreets, gat beats, had her runnin like track meets
Tax freak, class G, servin up them crack trees
Joe Rizza, rhyme blizza, from the streets 'til I take my roll
I take control, bank fold, ain't never gon' sell my soul
I stay committed, when shit go down in my town they say I did it
I gots ta get it, and when yo' stash look touched you know I hit it
You won't admit it, we bring it hella from that Detroit city
Nitty gritty, kick so much ass it gets my gators shitty
[Chorus: singer]
Niggaz desperate to be
But don't really know what it means to be
A real true G
Gangsters live and gangsters ride
It's hard to survive, either do or die
In this gangster li-iiiiiiiife
[Verse Three]
Dirty repercussions, nasty destruction, I'm talkin I'm bustin
Dumpin bullets in my foes, trigger pullin on you hoes
Born with the soul of a soldier; you don't even know what it means
to be a G well fuck with me and I'ma show ya
The definition, of a killer nigga, get that nigga
Bring him to me but don't kill him, let me deal with him
Cause I'ma peel him with my scalp, wodie shoulda kept his mouth closed
Now it's gonna scream high notes, like some altos
[Verse Four]
My nigga the war is true to down my haters and imitators, smash niggaz to pieces
Slash the anger from my gun crucify you bitches like Jesus
Squash beef, respect those when my niggaz roll through
You claimin a side I'm claimin trues when you make yo' move I make my move
Showtime fool, as I think about how you chin checked
Any minute they drop like two bitches beggin to get wet
Have some respect, cause on my team, a nigga marine
Stayin a foot off you scrubs, showin no love to all these hoe fiends
[Verse Five]
360 degrees fool! Shit, I burn like a Pyrex
So which one of you motherfuckers wanna step up, and die next?
Appetite for mutilation, gangster 2000
An operation no time for debatin, my troops is waitin
We roll like Dayton, wires, we keep yo' block on fire
Not Juvenile, but I crush empires, fuckin with me
I hurt you, like a Jamaican {?}
My bitch get evil like {?} a nigga murder mad

Take it, take it, take his money girl
[Verse Two]
I like to long-dick it, ain't nuttin wrong with it
And with your fast nasty ass, girl you gon' get it
Mo' skills than you EVER need
From the flats to the Hills in Beverly
Fo' sho', she's a P-R-O
Five-oh on the low wanna freak my hoe
... it's just another day on mine
They can't hold me down, cause I stay on the grind
I'm self-made, I'm gettin money hella ways
And I keep a bitch to help pay
A lot of girls have a sugardad
I ain't mad, is it good or bad?
Just make that mo-ney - even on Sun-day
You'll get it right one day
And next time some real ballers come through
They be spendin all their money on you
Now get it
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Damn girl, you look good right now
Ain't seen you in a while, you know we should ride out
I think about you in the mornin when I'm not witchu
Flashin back last time that I got witchu
Let them other niggaz masturbate and dream about you
I never give that ass a break, I'm in and out you
And on you, when you need someone to fuck you, call me
I'd love to, cause all week, I've been with this tall freak
I know she rank top notch bitch
She got it all, ridin in a drop-top bitch
I'm Short Dawg, them haters can't block my shit
Cause they love what you do with that hot twat bitch
Now get it

Get it

Now when you dreamin, it might not be real
But when you're all alone, that's how you feel
Do what you want, you just need a plan
Little money and a car, you could be the man
Cause havin money's what you're 'sposed to do
Spend some, then people start to notice you
Get all the things that you wish you had
Now all that little stuff don't get you mad
And once you get your foot in the door
Don't start actin like you can't look for more
There's always more money to be made
It's not everything, I know you wanna be paid
You should write it down and do the math
Anything in the world is what you can have
So listen to your potnah $hort
Get your money young man, you ain't gotta be broke, just

Now grab a freak, smoke some weed
And kick it all night with this funky-ass beat
It's been a long day, gotta stay on the grind
Up early, hustle for a long time
You want big dough?  You wanna get mo'?
You want a Cadillac truck and a six-fo'?
I tell all the little homies havin money in the ghetto
One day you gotta let go, but don't settle
for just hangin on the corner broke
Fiendin for a hit of what you wanna smoke, on that dope
Free yo' mind if it's trapped in the streets
But don't starve; you know us macks have to eat
I don't care if they don't like me
Just left the bank and I'm rollin up some light green
Now hold on to your dreams for me
Cause life ain't always what it seems to be, you gotta

[Verse Three]
(Is that Too $hort?) Baby yeah I'm back, it's on
You never woulda thought I could last this long
I don't associate with non-believers
If my girl keeps me naggin me then I'ma leave her
Cause I worked too hard for way too long
to get what I got and I'm way too strong
In yo' lifetime, if you don't get yours
Can't do no ballin like yo' nigga $hort
But once you on a roll, they can't stop it
Receivin checks, makin bank deposits
And that's just the way it is
Don't come around me if you're negative
I'm the player of the year, there is no other
I buy a mansion fo' my mother
See me ridin with the top down
I need some mo' money, can't stop now, I gotta

It's gettin close to the end y'all
But we gonna kick it like this on the last album
Verse One: Too $hort
Now let me holler at ya partner, spit this game
in you ear for a minute, quit complaining
Bout how you can't spend it cause you ain't got it
You got what it takes but not enough to get started
I hope you get the message, no it's not a test it's
Just me ridin legit, they can't arrest me or bust me
I'm still hungry, I want some more stuff
Get fat and watch my whole crew blow up
So get yours, and buy my new album
Peep the game and don't be like Calvin
Get everything you want, get real, get you mail
Get your girl to make bail and get your ass out of jail
You should be gettin it, everything you want
Everything you dreamed of, never have to front
you should be gettin it, gettin money
I'm talking bout you black, don't laugh it aint funny
You should get a good lawyer, like Johnny Cochran
Swear to tell the truth, hell no I didn't pop him
Get your kids in school, so they can get an education
Get a degree, and take a vacation
You see I got all my game from the streets of California
Young millionaire with no high school diploma
Livin real good, taking care of my folks
roll up a fat one for the players to smoke
Short Dawg in the house, I know you aint trippin
Cause Life is Too $hort you gotta Get In Where You Fit In
Stop looking for what you never seem to find
It ain't what you think you got to read between the lines
Cause life ain't long, for a young black man
Tryin to make money doing all he can
Sellin dope don't ya hope he would go to class
But the boy makes money and he makes it fast
with the twenties on top and the fifties on the bottom
I fuck the top notches oh yes we got em
It's been a long time since I first got down
But I still keep makin these funky sounds
Get your money man
Get yours
Chorus: P-Funk
You should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good, get it while you can
you should be gettin it
Get it while the gettin is good (repeat as necessary)
Verse Two: Too $hort
Get your money man, get yours
you should be gettin it
I know you tired of being broke just hanging out
You gotta lot a dreams but you can't get out
The first thing you need to do is set your self some goals
Think positive, everything else is old
and work hard, never stop hustlin
Cause they just love to see the black man strugglin
(So what are you saying Todd?)
It's time to come up, put your dollar bills in the air
He said meet me at the White House and I was there
Cause I'm one in a million, black man rising
They wanna keep me down but I always surprise em
Spend my money in the hood, I know it's all good
and you should do the same I told you peep the game
Too $hort, you know I'm the man
I lend my brother a hand cause I know I can
I keep going and goin but I'm not the pink bunny
Insted of beatin on a drum I never stop thinkin money
I'm gettin all I can if you don't ya slip
I can't wait to get to heaven just to have a grip
When I was broke, I couldn't afford a meal
But now I'm now rich I can't be fake I gots to keep it real
It's been a long time baby since I first got down
But it still keep making these funky sounds

The ghetto's been good to me
I'm never going to turn my back

That's your life
Girl
Smoking that glass pipe
I come from the city of dope
It couldn't be saved by john the pope
Coz the base head lyric sees the light
Two fat raps to the head last night
Cocaine cocaine, is that your rap
Every day and night it's coming back
C-o-c-a-i-n-e
The rich man's high what it used to be
But things looking different in eighty-five
Cocaine, cocaine is that your high
Since age thirteen what have I seen
A lotto of base heads straight coke fiends
Snorting, puffing, that's the life
But it's all over when you hit that pipe
Big coke dealers on the knock
All smoked up with no more rocks
Base heads buy, coke from him
But he smokes more than all of them
The big coke man, ain't too cool
He smokes more than all you fools
He's gotta a lotta do, but not a lotta bank
A brand new car with an empty tank
Pretty white smoke all in his chest
And a 84 benz, reposessed
Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
Fresh young tender only fifteen
Walking on a strip just wanna be seen
Never touch coke a day in her life
But now that girl's gotta have her pipe
Coz she met a man his name was jock
Do it to her a good and he smoked a rock
Put it in her joint all crunched up
And now everyday she takes a puff
Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
I know you know what coke can do
Come into your life and take over you
Now you kicking back thinking bout your dream
But it never comes true coz you're just a coke fiend
You asked your woman what's the prob
She said it's you coz you don't do your job
Used to make good love from the start
But now coke had done damage to your private parts
Girl, that's your life
Girl smoking that glass pipe
Your mind is gone your brain is blazed
You've been wide awake for the last three days
Inhale, exhale you don't care
Coke smoke only no fresh air
You can't even talk you don't wanna listen
You and your body on that cocaine mission
Three days straight where's your mind
It's gonna out of town and your brain is fried
Just smoke and choke until you're broke
Just smoke that coke until you croke
And it would be, I can't lie
No great loss if you should die
Coz your life is wrecked, you girl is checked
She chose on my and I was set
I took her home to make my move
But she wanted to base she was just like you

Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride
Such a good life, good life

Verse One:
YOu thought it was a fad, you really cant understand rap
How these young playas come up and live fat
Big houses, cars, watch the homies bubble
Do a lot of good but cant stay out of trouble
?? cause hes the president, he bought a lot of stuff you could never get
Take us to the game you wanna see my bus,
but all the little kids wanna be like us
When they get home, and turn the TV on,
its Too $hort baby on the microphone
I see a lot of styles when im watching videos
Looking at the backround talking at the hoes
Then they R and B cats incorporated rap into their program
(What happened to the slow jams)
We dropping platinum, numba one, bitch, thats how its done

Verse Two:
Lil homie went to school everyday, knew what he wanted
Wa'nt trying to be a thug wa'nt trying to get blunted
It was all a dream, but theres certain things
You gotta do, like do good in school
His best friend wouldnt listen didnt make good grades
Coach kicked him off the team wouldnt let 'em play
So he stopped going to school and started hangin with some g's
Drinkin beer and smoking weed
Two years later one went to college quick he got a basketball scholarship
His homeboy was in the hood one day got arrested
Took him to the pen they say he got molested
Jealous cause his old friend took the right path
Watching ESPN I saw him in the draft
Now he got a V-12 sittin on dubs, thats how it is when ya what

When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride

Verse Three:
She used to be a nerd on the honor roll
A four eye conesour, books kinda short on looks
A latch key kid, best friend was her computer
In high school nobody wanted to do her
When she graduated from college she got paid
Got a good job, now she got it made
Gots some contacts, and let her hair down
She gots the legs and the walk that'll make you stare her down
You betta get youre shit together you running out of time
Something on your mind, you need to stop lyin'
You aint balling like her you cant get into the party
Out in beverly hills trying flip a ferrari
Butcha credit aint cool and you got declined
He said ""Youre welcome"" and ""But to come back anytime""
But me, im spending cash for this bitch
And thats just the way it is

When you living the good life, good life
Everything is tight, money right
Everbody wanna be by youre side, trying to ride

We talk shit, cause we are the shit
Never looked back since we started it
When ya'll want heat we provide it, ride it
'Til the wheels fall of, shaking 'em all off
Six figure niggas with it, over did it, spit it
In ways that'll cause a rush
Keeping your face in a state of disgust
Hating but still trying to be like us
Verse One: Jay-Z
Twist the lime on the corona, grab my crime diploma
Then head to the block, to pull up five in the mona
Shit, I need to chrome up, become a home owner
Look lifes a bitch, but im on her
I almost cracked this, no more hustling backwards
Up the ave I zip, nigga trying to have shit
Im your average, ghetto nigga turned maverick
You'd never, said to a nigga ""Whateve for the cash, im with""
I dont have step, I leave it in youre averix
Then shoot it it the air, whateva I have left
Outlaw, simply I out draw y'all
Wether clubs or the street, I out ball y'all
Niggas aint ready, I doubt all y'all
Fly ass niggas I reroute all y'all
If it aint for the paper I dont show my face up
Make a bet I turn the ace up, $hort and Jay, what
Verse two: Too $hort
I never stop making money dont give 'em no slack
Drinking dirty motherfuckers til a hoe come back
With my scratch, bitch I was born to mack
To uphold the pimping, I was sworn to that
I hear a lot of shit talking when I listen to rap
Only a few mc's get to hang that plaque
On the wall rappers ball, but they dont live phat
Nigga, I doubt if you go gold or platinum
What we do has only been mastered by a few
I take a half a million tapes sell 'em straight to you
All that shit niggas talking just cant be real
I dont need a record deal, I need eighteen wheels
I roll right up in the hood I got tapes for sell
Bitches running in their house they cant wait to tell
Somebody, she got a new Too $hort tape
And hes spitting pimp game with his homeboy Jay

Now here they come again the gold diggas trying to get paid,
Wanna trick the old rich niggas, trying to get laid
She'll suck his dick, as soon as she meet him
Dont have to sell a body for me I dont need her
To turn tricks for me, how much you cost bitch?
Im all about large bank deposits
On and off the mic I always set trends
Either you see with bitches, or Im rolling with pimps
Brook-laan to Oakland, I keep smokin'
Jay-Z and short dog at these hoes again
The kinda niggas that'll take a square bitch around the corner
Put this pimp game on her
I dont fuck with broke hoes and I dont trick
But I'll still rub my big ass dick on her clit
Get her hooked, wanna be mine I need some money
If she aint kicking in all the time she dont want me
Verse Four: Jay-Z
Hoes, flows, money, cars
Y'all wannabe stars cant fuck with none of these bars
This is real nigga rap, we can spit it through the mic
And you can feel niggas scratch, and sell a mil if that
So real when we drop this shit its in trouble
When I guess the pair you gotta ship it double
In the independent phenom, y'all minature dons
Wannabe jigga, pops styles and hennessy richa'
When I die, leave my canopy richa'
I put it down hard ever since I entered the pit'cha
Can fuck with me for records to the recreational cent'a

You call 'em rags, we call 'em drops
You ride black walls, we ride Vogues
You got a girlfriend, we pimp hoes
You say I'm fake, I say you're smoking
I'm just a mack named $hort from Oakland
Just like a tag team wrestling tip
With a nasty bitch, then the homie switch
Bitch, ain't getting nothing but a lesson taught
If your pimping ain't strong, it's not my fault
Hoes start choosing, wouldn't give 'em a break
I pull out my old white Too $hort tape
I'm playing ""Dope Fiend Beat"" and the shit still hits
Trying to stick my dick all in them lips
She said ""No, I never did it before""
Well you ain't the bitch I'm looking for
Cause she's rich and thick and chocolate
Wouldn't hesitate to lick my dick
All my parters say ""$hort what's up?""
See me with a bitch with a big-ass butt
I don't answer, I start laughing
Nothing going on but the Oaktown macking
Laying it right, all damn night
Hoes getting sprung like they smoking the pipe
El Dorado, Mazeratti
Nothing but freaks with fine bodies
I love to roll my Mercedes Benz
I'm nothing but a player like all my friends
So when you call me fake, be for real
The call me Short Dog cause I'm hard as hell
Hope your girlfriend's name ain't Linelle
I screwed her last night in a cheap motel
Like I told my crew, when the toss up's chill
Humping like a Chevy rolling down Foothill
Get off the pipe fool, stop cracking
Be like Short Dog and start macking
T double O S-H-O-R-T
I go solo, can't nobody fuck with me
I'll just kick back counting my bank
No cokes smoking, just potent dank
Funky fresh on the microphone
When you spin that wax, it's not the same ol' song
Round and round it goes, where it stops no one knows
You see me at the clubs catching all the hoes
I don't drink vodka, I do drink gin
I like to get a blowjob from your girlfriend
Cause I'm macking, baby, you know that's right
I'm from the Oaktown, straight Eastside
I got all my game from East Oakland streets
Now motherfuck you damn shit-haired freaks
I go on and on as I sing my song
If you're tender and young, I fuck you all night long
I'm not a no-good punk, I didn't make you flunk
I didn't tell the whole world your pussy stunk
I cut you slack in my rap, I could've macked your mother
But Life is Too $hort so I kept it undercover
I'm so damn hard, on the boulevard
Hoes ain't tripping on me, they wanna fuck my car
Freak nasty don't trip, to me it ain't shit
You can suck my dick with some fat hoe lips
Riding in a Caddy with the top let down
California sunshine, cruising the town
On the boulevard, maybe drop my top
If you're feeling hot, don't even stop
Cause it feels so good, I'm oh so sprung
They way you work that tongue, it just makes me cum
I told all my homies, all about
The way I bust big nuts, in your mouth
On the boulevard, we're riding oh so real
Not Skyline, I'm talking about Foothill
And when it ended, you know what happened
I'm so hard I just can't stop macking
I know I gotta stop sooner, but I'll stop later
They call me Short Dog, I'm nothing but a player
I know what she's thinking, ""I'm falling in love""
But there's another freak I'm thinking of
She's got long long hair, she's not like you though
She'll do whatever I say, she'll even be my hoe
Cause I don't wanna get married, I'd rather freak Mary
Make good love and I do mean very
Wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) Tight-ass jeans to pose in
I used to ride the strip trying to catch the hoes
They wasn't choosing, nope not these hoes
They wanted big time Vettes, riding brand new Vouges
So like I said before, I ain't tripping
Told myself it's time to stop bullshitting
Did the gangster walk, did it like this
Walked up to a girl and I called her a bitch
I said ""My name is $hort, I don't play games
I only play young bitches, now what's your name?""
She said ""I wouldn't tell you in all my life
You're just a little thug, you're not my type""
I said ""I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk""
East Oaktown is where I'm from
You see wherever I go, it's the same old case
Same damn thing all over the place
(Nothing but bitches) Mad cause I told the truth
I'm calling you one and you can call me, too
Call me Too $hort, call me ""Too Thin""
But you wouldn't get a dime out of this pimp
So just give it up baby and I'll run right through ya
Maybe just maybe I'll come back to ya
Like Too Clean, I'm riding Cadillac
I hit the strip, turn around, and come right back
See I'm a big mack, and every bitch in sight
Says ""Is that Short Dog sitting at a red light?""

[Intro: Too $hort (& Cutty)]
Nasty bee-yatch (let's go niggaz don't know what to deal a hoe)
You just a tramp hoe
[Chorus: Cutty Cartel]
No I don't like (?)by and no I don't eat caviar
But you might catch me exquisit at the bar
You're the finest that I seen thus far
So, won't you come on in, shorty you can bring your friend
Just let me finish all my troubles shot of here
We can leave now the sport begins, on you
[Verse 1: Too $hort]
It's time to fuck baby, jump in the truck baby
Cause I been wantin' to tear yo fine ass up lately
You like your dicks big, you like the way they taste
Don't shoot it let me take it out and cum on your face
I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine
Let's keep it funky and live, just like the bassline
My girl will lick your clit, the bitch is on this shit
Close your eyes you'll swear you're fuckin' in a porno flick
The way you want my dick, you got my thing hard
You got skills, you should win an ABN award
I got my playing card, it's the two of spades
Deuce is wild, check it out, and you was laid
Now we moanin' and groanin' screamin' and hollin'
All them super top notches, yeah, you'll see who they followin'
Big Dog will make you open your eyes wider
Cause this dick is like the big thick pipe piper
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Too $hort]
You're such a nasty girl, take them panties off
The way you do it is impossible, I can't get soft
You up your fuckin' like your pussy got a motor
Missionary, on top, from the back, roll you over
You just hupmin' and I keep pumpin'
Then I ride around my body cause my beat's bumpin'
Yeah I know you know, I'm a pimp hoe
And I heard all about you, little nymfo
Pussy like Niagara Falls, they say you love it all
So when I nut, suck my dick, bitch, and rub my balls
Cause I'm nasty too you'd better ask it's true
It's a one time shot, I'm just passin' through
Don't be shy, don't be stingy, don't be holdin' back
And don't get hooked on the dick, like you're smokin' crack
Just keep doin' what you doin', don't change a thing
And you'll see how much love this pimp game can bring
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Devin the Dude]
Ain't no sense in frontin' let's go, move something
You know I want some of that pussy girl, why you frontin'?
You can rub on my nuts, while your friends ain't watchin'
If you expect a check for some sex, it ain't happenin'
I'm the vagina finder, the cunt collecting king
I'm 'bout to get a platinum penis ring
Your second guess is bitches, and yes or no
You're down with shit, just move around let's go
Damn..you still here, ain't nobody lookin' for ya?
Do you have a home or an appartment or ya
Kinda stay here with the crew, knowin' the shit that we do
We just frant through, a couple of bitches just like you
Where ya girlfriends? Where ya car at? What's the damn deal?
Girl you got to leave here for real
I hope you wasn't plannin' to get your stack on
Get up bitch put your panties back on
It's over
[Chorus]

Daaaamn!
Can't believe these hoes out here givin away the pussy for the low-low
Shit! Bitches fuckin everythang, everybody, everyday
Damn girl! Better get you some management
All this time you been trickin for the low-low?
You coulda been gettin rich, you just don't know
Girl you worked all night for that chump change?
Let them ballers write you off as a fun thang?
Take my hand - I got a quick plan
I know you dream about marryin a rich man
See his wife in the Benz with the cute babies?
The hype'll make your friends and you crazy
Cause you know about his two ladies
But he ain't fuckin wit'chu baby
Come holla at your Uncle $hort
I'll have you playin these niggaz like a sport (HA HA!)
[Chorus:]
All this time you play around, you love to love me lay you down
If you'd like to suck a dick, I bet you'd like to fuck a trick
All you ladies in the place, I'd love to let you have a taste
I'll put my dick up in yo' face - why you hobo hoe?
[Too $hort:]
My name is Too $hort, I'm known for pimpin women
And last night, I did it again
New money, new bitches
Why they actin crazy, who is it?
I never heard of Too $hort - then you must be a square
Fuck around and get slapped when you fucks with a player
Real women get much respect
Golddiggers and groupies, don't fuck with it
I'd rather get a real hoe
Put the bitch to work and get some real dough
I don't wanna spend a night for cash
What'chu been doin all day wit your triflin ass? (Bitch!)
[Chorus]
[Too $hort:]
I made too many songs, to name the tracks
Not enough walls, to hang the plaques
Say hater, what you aimin at?
You ain't no G, you can't be claimin that
Your girl said she had to find a trick
Cause she don't like you, OR your tiny dick
I don't really care, what she's sayin
As long as this song, is what she's playin
I know she better slow that roll
I ain't said a word and yo' hoe just chose
You know I gotta take her from you
And after today, you couldn't make her want you (HA HA HA)
[Chorus]
[New Chorus:]
I just don't know what bitches see, why all these hoes want chicken feed
Ain't none of these hoes worth 50 cents, so break these ladies all you pimps
Never have this much fun anywhere, to go back home I just don't care
Me leave this game no I don't dare - why you hobo hoe?
[Too $hort:]
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, bitch I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, you know I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, I'm fuckin wit'chu
You fuckin with me, bitch I'm fuckin wit'chu too

Make Daddy happy, y'all get that dick
Since they're everywhere, you figure I'll stop
Couldn't be a better player than me

Yeah, you know, it's like, ehm - I rap
I got two platinum albums
I do a lotta concerts all over the place
I seen the groupies
They do whatever you say
When you want it, how you want it, and where you want it
But I ain't trippin
Cause these are the ?90s
So when a freak say to me she loves me
I just say somethin like this
[ verse 1 ]
I say baby, why you wanna do all that?
Sleep with a brother just because I rap
You keep lookin in my eyes, and you just won't stop
All damn night you been on my jock
But I'm no fool
Cause you're sprung on my house and my swimming pool
Call me a dog, I got several freaks
When I do my shows I can't get no sleep
Cause you keep knockin at my hotel door
I was there to sleep, and can't get no more
Sleep, so why you wanna wake me up?
When I told you once I don't wanna fuck
So get on, girl, won't you mind your own
I'm tryin to sleep, so just leave me alone
Next time I see you, I do my duty
But tonight, I got another hoochie
[ chorus: d'wayne wiggins ]
Hoochie, tryin to be bourgie
But you're nothin but a groupie
Riding on my snoopy
[ verse 2 ]
I'm short dog, I wanna take you backstage
And you can read it like it's on the front page
You wanna do somebody right
For those who ain't famous - not tonight
You do the nba and the nfl
Rappers and singers as well
Keyboard players and the drummer
It's like track and field with just runners
So let me get on the phone and call all my friends
Ain't a damn thing changed but the paint on our benz
Get somethin that you can't get from good girls
Care less about a weave or a jherri curl
Cause I know something you don't know
Ain't nothin like these groupie hoes
And since tony toni ton? made the track
Get lost, fool, and tell your girl I'm back
Sing it
[ chorus ]
[ verse 3 ]
Get off my lap, cause you're gettin kinda heavy
Lookin at the bed, askin am I ready
Ready for what, sex?
Well, after that, baby, what's next?
We get a house in the suburbs, two-car garage
And every night I get a good massage?
Save that drama for later
And take this number to my skypager
Keep in touch, but don't call too much
When I come back around, you know what's up
It's time to get busy once again
Bring a few partners, cause I got friends
It's goin down like always
Young groupies in the hallways
I got the money, the fame, and all the things you like
So I see you next time when I rock the mic
You

Too $hort don't stop that rap!¡¯
Now everytime I grab the mic
I rock you just like that
8 years ago when I started to rap
I use to sell tapes everywhere
It was me and my homeboy freddy b, yoo
Kickin' it like big players
Everybody loved my raps like 100 dollar bills
I rocked houseparties on 98th
Even rocked in 69 vill
Might find me on the mic at Hot Lips house
Or at the Eastbay Dragonspot
All the 85th boys with their hand in the air
Screamin' Too $hort just don't stop!¡¯
Like Royal Park, like Plymouth Rock
First street and Sunnyside
Like Sobrante Park and Brookefield
East Oakland, yeah, that's right
5 years ago I continued to rock
And if you haven't yet heard my name
It was all in the papers, on the evening news
I was stone cold in the game
Around that time a friend of mine
My homeboy Lionel B hooked me up like this, yoo
On the stage just rockin' the beat
Some say I have a dirty mind
Sometimes that might be true
But these are just some dirty times
I ain't trippin' on you...
I ain't trippin', keep on talkin'
You think i'm smokin' that pipe
I got money, homeboy
I even got some of your future wifes
Well, my story goes like this, man
I smooth went out on wax
Singin' Girl, That's Your Life¡¯
Female Funk¡¯ and Shortrapp¡¯
Silky D worked the beat kicked me cold cash
I was ridin' the bus one day
Next day I was on the gas
Everybody loved Too $hort
Rollin' down the strip
Then one day just like that
Homeboy jumped on my tip
You started spreadin' rumors, man
Said you saw me rappin' in jail
No, I never came down to the flatlands
I was chillin' with the homies from the hill
I ain't trippin' but the word went out
Sir Too $hort was through
Can't really say where it all began
So i'ma blamin' it all on you
Everybody use to say
Too $hort don't stop that rap!¡¯
Now everytime you see my face
You say i'm smokin' crack
Oakland, California, I heard it all before
I'm makin' big bank now, rockin' the crowd
I ain't trippin' no more...
Now I'm back on top again
I still don't stop that rap
Everytime I grab the mic
My bankroll's gettin' fat
Freaky Tales¡¯ took care of that
You know I'm comin' up
Cause everytime you see my face
I'm rollin' all so tough
When I made the cut...the-he-he Freaky Tales¡¯
I started picturin' this
I named my album Born To Mack¡¯
With the cleaniest raps and beats
Everythin' was kickin' in
Me and Ran kept cashin' checks
Next thing I know there you go
Guess who's on my tip?
You said I just got out of jail
Jumped right back on that pipe
Your sister's boyfriend told you, man
I'm smokin' every night
Then you came to my show
And stood there so damn bold
You said Too $hort, man, you smoking'
And i'm standin' here dreamin' gold
I ain't trippin' no more
Really ain't worth my time
So to squashed it off I kicked on back
And wrote you all the rhyme
Benzes rollin', Beemers jettin'
And Caddies keep on dippin'
You keep on talkin' all that crap
I ain't trippin'...

I saw The Mack and got all so sprung
I couldn't help it, I had to be just like that
With a stable of hoes and my pockets fat
But don't trip, I made up my mind when I was 17
I ain't with no marriage and a wedding ring
I be a player for life, forget about a wife
She just ain't my type
Cause i mack each hoe and get richer
And if it ain't like that then I forget ya
I know you're just a freak, hoe
You're so nasty
That's why you're stairin'
When you walk like pass me
Bitch, now you're lookin' back
All dogs must chase the cat
So here I come, I just wanna fuck you and cut
Treat you like trampy slut
So much game when homies' tough
Meet a bitch like you and smooth come up
I have your fake-ass closin' up bank accounts
Spittin' straight pimpgame from the Oakland-town
It's been done before and i do it again
Break your mama, your sista and all your friends
$hort dog's on the microphone
And I won't stop mackin' till my bank is long
So try to break me if you wanna
From me you get nothin' but drama
If you're a rich bitch, I got a new twist
And if you're with it, bitch
Then we can do this
Put me on the payroll
Bick me down bankroll
Buy me a benz and keep my tank full
Cause other than that, I don't need no brood
$hort Dog ain't nothin' but a dog...
I got all my game from East Oakland's street
So mothafuck you damn shit-head freaks
Couldn't pay me enough to treat you right
Cause $hort Dog ain't nothin' nice
Like a sucka-mothafucka let a bitch be boss
Tellin' him how much she wants
Let her use your car
I'm from oakland, bitch
And you can check my rap
I hear fake bitches get slapped
Let a bitch get bold with me
I start to act like Goldy
Tell me who's in the house now?
Shorty The Pimp
And I'm the last mothafucka
That will pay your rent
I ain't blind, I know you're fine as fuck
But you're a tramp, bitch
You ain't mine what's up?
Try to give me some pussy but I want some head
And I allready know everythin' you did
They say you fuck like old-ass tired bitch
But the word is out you suck some good ass dick
And I don't want nothin' if I can't get it all
You should know
Cause I ain't nothin' but a dog, bitch...
$hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Bitch, fuck with me and you gotta do it all
Most brothas try to take freaks out
I get a room and stick my dick in her mouth
They spend money on a movie and some dinner
But $hort Dog goes straight up in her
I give bitches no respect
And the way I run my game they understand this shit
You couldn't be like me cause you buy her things
Used to be a broke fiend and now it's diamond rings
I remember when I fucked your prom date
You bought a dress and everythin'
But she just couldn't wait for the pralm to end
So she can call me up it was our very first date
And it was cool to fuck
Now I be doin' this shit all the time
I got bitches on my mind
Can't change in 1992
Cause I still gotta find new, sweet, black
What should I call it? I won't say it
But if it's lain' on my bed, I'm a fade it
$hort dog ain't nothin' but a dog
Use to clown to hoes at the East Maid mall
I was actin' like a pimp when I was 7
Started to suckin' up game at 11
And at the age of young 14
I started to knock young bitches on the scene
Couldn't give a fuck less about a bitch
Thinkin' like that $hort Dog got rich
Now I'm makin' ends and you think i'm weak
Cause i'm allways downin' these toe-up freaks
Tell me who's the man
And who's the mouse, bitch?
I'm Audi-five to my dog house...

Until you kick that Short Dog habit got you on my dick,

You feel like she's your soulmate
Can't wait to walk down da aisle wit da tramp
It's true love cause she's da only one your thinkin of

Ask no questions
Just turn kiss her
She's everything you looking for, in a woman
Wake up early in da mornin
And give you sumpthin
That's more pleasure than material wealth
You can't feel that good all by yourself
Let alone the last bitch you had was kinda frigid
Couldn't get on top and she didn't lick dick

Take you out to dinner and she give you some cash
There's only one flaw

You done slipped up and got you a real good ho
I know God damn well, it's you life
Why you tryin to turn a ho into a house wife
She's just a cum freak (oooooooooooooooo)
Let you shoot it on her face (oooooooooooooooooo)
Do it on da first day (oooooooooooooooooooo)
She's gotta have dat taste
I know you love her
Chorus
I know you love her ( I know you love her)
But she's a tramp bitch ( she's a tramp bieatch)
I know you love her ( I know you love her)
But she's a tramp bitch (tramp bitch, tramp bitch)
Verse 2: slink capone
Well she can suck my dick
And it break jaw
Had em ho's
Love it when I nut in there face
Cause they say it taste like ? ? ? ? ?
Take off da draws
Let da homies hit
Ain't no future in ya front
Cause youze a freak and you won't admit it
Sittin in da passanger seat
Lookin pretty
Your attuitude is shitty
But all I wanna do is kill a kitty
Oh, you wanna free ride?
Bitch get your ass out
You can keep on walkin til you get to hot and pass out
When we was at you mama's house your hand was on my leg
Makin my dick rise up
Now I'm ready to fuck
But you insist on makin a nigga wish for it
Takin shit for it
But girl I ain't goin to spend a brick for it
One thing you gotta doooooo
To be a g like meeeee
Be down to make them bitches catch that rtd
Bitches be fakin
Suckin dick or videotapin
When they hear about the money you makin they yellin way
But you can fuck, fight and hitchhike
I know you love her (I know you love her)
Too short
That's right
Ain't givin no bitches no kind of slack
(because she's a tramp bieatchh)
Verse 3: too short
You know it ain't nothin wrong
Whats goin on
As long as you ain't mad when she don't come home
Cause baby ain't frontin
And that's how it is
You gotta get use to sharin your bitch
If you had another girl, you knew she wouldn't care
But ain't tryin to be no ice cold playa
Sayin stupid shit, like take me car
She hit the next nigga house and go make him hard
Fuck him real good cause she's gotta have it
Men can't resist her cause she's a bad bitch
Fell in love wit her, your not da first
Face in her thighs
Can't stop the thirst
She could be worse
Get back wit your first
Her pussy's so dead you could ride it in a hearse
Only missionary style
You can't get wild
She's the kind of woman that could have your child
But there ain't no turnin around
Your posted like a lamp
Nigga fucked around and fell in love wit a tramp
Face lit like a bug, everytime you see her
She takin off her clothes and you can't wait to eat her
So good, you wanna stay wit da freak
If you could you would fuck her every day of da week
I know you love her (ooooooooooooooooo)
But you can't stay naked (oooooooooooooo)
Gotta keep this kinda shit in the right perspective
Chorus
Verse 4: slink capone
Uh, don't act like you don't want to lick me
Pretendin youze da bomb
Me and da homies had you gone off a 40 ounce of mickeys and a bag of
Dirtweed
That's all I got
To make da situation hot
It got graphic in traffic
Had to back on up
I had to pull up to your bumber
And gun the, nut on your back and your neck
And now you got a hairy bone and a link
Compilament of ? ? ? ? ? ? slink
Don't trip, next time you wanna see safe sex
I had da shit taped up on the vhs
I taped all da hoes, all my bitches
And then watch em later on da 52 inches
Baller style cause we livin in da killa cali kingdom
Big heat, big dick and big nuts is all I bringin
Next time I want to see you I'll pop another 23
I'll be watchin you but you can't see me
Bitch
I know you love her

You wanna fuck her all da time

You feel like she's your soulmate

It's true love cause she's da only one your thinkin of
You don't care about da dick she suck
You gonna miss her
Ask no questions
Just turn kiss her
She's everything you looking for, in a woman
Wake up early in da mornin
And give you sumpthin
That's more pleasure than material wealth
You can't feel that good all by yourself
Let alone the last bitch you had was kinda frigid
Couldn't get on top and she didn't lick dick

Take you out to dinner and she give you some cash
There's only one flaw
You know she ain't faithful

She was a betty I done knew back in the day
Little scary lil' bitch from around the way
Plus she sucked and fucked all day
With a little bit of Alize (Alize..Alize..)
[Scarface]
I put it down for these young hoes,
get the pussy like I'm married
And send her home with the cock swoll, did her pops know?
Little girl that he tryna protect was in the crib doin porno
[Too Short]
Fo' sho' baby, I know these hoes
Step up too 'em and show these hoes
I never wonder to myself ""Would she?""
I get deep in her mind and her pussy
[Trick Daddy]
Who dat? She was the world's greatest, dick sucker
Play the note with the tongue while, finger fuck her
I hit it in the dark in the back of the Benz
Got my dick in her ass, front of one of her friends
[Scarface]
Face down, ass up -- bitch be still whikle I bust this nut
I rock hard while I'm in these guts
Wipe my dick and then that's enough

She wanna kiss me after she done lick me
Slap the drunk, you know the ho got Tinesi

Cuz the ho lookin for a P-I-M-P

You know the ho don't know no better
I would rough ride ya ass, but the magnum's better
I know a lot of niggas done paid ya bitch
Remember one thing, I got a major bitch

Pull up on the stroll, in the fo' door Caddy
Slapped the bitch, she hollered ""No, no daddy!""
I got the cash, if she don't that's her ass
So quick, so fast
[Chorus - 1st pt. Too Short, 2nd pt. by female]
I love gettin my head blown

I love gettin my pussy ate
I love when niggas see me masterbate
I love it when you nut all in my face
I love it baby, but I can't stand the taste
[Too Short]
I once knew a bitch named Erica
Way back in the day, she had a geri curl
I made her suck my dick on the ferris wheel
Been pimpin all my life, big player for real
[Daz]
I said ""Come on girl, you know how it's 'sposed to be""
It's makin me nut, but feel our fantasy
Come on come on baby, won't you get the best of me

And one dose of the dick, she be doublin back

Girl I must confess, your love is the best,
Cause all we wanna do is put this dick in you
Girl I must confess, cause your love is the best,
All we wanna do is put this up in you
Verse 1:
When I first saw you, I couldn't stop watchin you,
I couldn't stop thinkin bout how I should be knockin you
All I wanna do is holla at you later,
Handle my business, you know I'm a player
I've never been a hater, I shouldn't be faultin you,
But you got me laughin at the nigga you talkin to
I guess you like squares, whats up with tonight?
Like Tupac says you need a thug in your life
A nigga like me, I'll beat that pussy up,
Have you at the house doin all kinda freaky stuff
Aint nuttin new to me, watcha wanna do to me,
I know you aint no groupie, givin up the coochie
But I got deep in your drawls anyway,
I'll get it again, if I want it any day
I got that game from the coast out west,
Your pussy's the best, I must confess
Hook
Verse 2:
I can't sleep at night, you always keep me up,
Suckin on my dick, let me deep in them guts
I can't stop fuckin you, runnin all up in you,
I know you got a nigga but you still know what to do
You never hold back, never act shy,
Make it look so good I never close my eyes
I like the way your titties shake when your ridin me,
You take it out lick it and say put it back inside of me
And thats what I'ma do bitch, give you this true dick,
Bring all your girlfriends, and we can do this
I got alot of homies, and we all got game,
Y'all can hang with them squares but its not the same
I wont take you to the movies or a fake club,
I take you straight to my house get naked and fuck
$hort Dog'll never settle for less,
I must confess, you got the best
Hook
Verse 3:
I keep a gang of hoes on my team at all times,
Let a nigga know that the pussy's all mine
Hit it on the regular, you know I'm good for that,
Top notch bitches, even fuck them hood rats
Take her to the mansion, take off the pants then,
Kidnap the pussy and hold it for ransom
But none of them bitches can fuck like you,
Hit me on my beeper you know I'm comin through
Just like that, always was and always will be,
I'll get ya wet, and then you gonna feel me
Way up in ya, not far from Virginia,
Stick it in your mouth on the way down south
So when you get home and smell the cum on your breath,
Go in the bathroom and play with yourself
Your pussy's the best, I must confess,
Whenever your horny I got a ""S"" on my chest

We need a remedy, to take us from the reign
Jealousy, a little greed
I've been thinking, of what I need
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and every night
I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak, exclusivly
So that she only comes and satisfies me
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and everynight (help me out!)
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak everyday and every night
I need a freak, with long long hair
A super freak, in underwear
I need a freak, here what I say
I need a freak, to get me through the day
I need a freak, so I can swerve
I need a super freak, to calm my nerves
Now everyday is the same, I go get me a freak
Take her to my house to we hit the sheets
Got a saltwater fish tank built in the wall
Fat jucuzi tub, sitting in marble
Freaks can't resist, the way it's laid
I spit the game and I got paid
Say short what you doing with all that stack
Bitch seen all four walls had plaques
She go on and drop them drawls
Don't take to long, she can't stop the law with street player
Short dogg baby is a
Kyptonite smoked out crazy nigga
I slip some crip on the freak (bitch)
She started licking on my feet
Up to my ears, back down to here
I need a freak everyday and that's real
I need a freak everyday and every night
I need a freak everyday and every night
They say the freaks come out at night
You on my mind, you outta sight
If I don't see ya tonight it ain't on
I take my other little young bitch home
Niggers like me, know just what to do
Me and homie want to fuck with you and your girl
Teach you about the new world
Spit the game like old school perms and curls
Get naked, and do that girl
Keep it right there I got on in the chamber
I aim it at your face and then squeeze the trigger
Can you hang with a freaky ass nigger
She took it all, had a ball
She got nothing but a party y'all
So all you squares and player haters don't sleep
I need a freak
I need a freak, to hold me tight
I need a freak, everyday and every night
I need a freak with long long hair
A super freak, in underwear
I need a freak, I really do
I want a freak, one with ass that looks like you
I need a freak, here what I say
I need a freak, to get me through the day
Short dogg's in the house
Ya that's right
Players will be players baby
All dogs must chase the cat
Famous words
We going to get off into this x-rated shit
Ant banks, can I flip the script?
If you break the beat down I'm going to come back, watch
So break it down, watch
We're going to break it down old school style
This is the old school type right?
Short dogg's in the house representing east oakland west coast
This is a west coast thang bitch!
I need a motherfucking bitch, you know what I'm saying
So we're going to call this part two
It's called ""i need a bitch""
I need a bitch, to hold me tight
I need a bitch to suck my dick every night (every night)
I need a bitch, I need to get paid
I need a bitch, tonight short dogg's getting laid (that's right)
I need a bitch, you all here me talking
I need a bitch, cause real pimp game be walking
I need a bitch, I really do
I want a nasty ass bitch that acts like you, bitch!

It only takes a second, to pop the trunk
And just like that you know it's real
You're in the right damn town to get killed
It's all about the game, and nothin else
You come out here, you better watch yourself
Cause you can wear what you want, even blue or red
But cross the wrong brothers, and end up dead
You catch a body full of bullets, and get blasted
Tryin to be a gangsta but you just ain't lastin
This little town is gettin wild as hell
Check the penetentiaries and all the jails
If they could lock us all up that would be just fine
Got my partners from oakland doin serious time
You can't argue with the truth it's hard to be black
But it's a mindgame, and you gotta deal with that
I wake up everyday and I just can't wait
To make mo money, cause back in the days
When I rapped, I did the same damn thing I do now
Grab the microphone, and show you how
But I was broke, the only thing I had was game
I started makin money and knew things would change
Bought a benz, thought it might earn respect
But the opd, found it hard to accept
I got jacked by the task and jacked by the vice
Face down on the ground keep my hands in sight
Put the handcuffs on backseat I'm in it
Illegal search for about thirty minutes
Askin me, where's the dope
Where's my gun, but I don't know
I said I'm rappin, they laugh like I told a joke
And to this day they think I'm sellin coke
I want to be free! (and that's the truth) ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! ohhh yeahhh
I be in oakland california every day of my life
Bass so hard you think I'm smokin a pipe
And if I don't smoke it, I gots to grind
Searched all my stuff, and all you find
Is a pocket full of money count seven g's
Now you wanna think I'm sellin keys
Cause I'm a black man, but I run my own business
So why the police wanna send me to prison
They see a brother makin major cash
They knock a patch out his black ass
And that's the truth, you can't argue you at all
Tryin to give you ten years for a phone call
Ain't even trippin on the dank smoke
Cause all they wanna find, is guns and coke
In court all the time tryin to fight it
We get rich, we get indeibted
So what's the problem officer this time?
Is havin big money bein black a crime?
Or did you take me to jail, to teach me a lesson
Charge me with somethin, or just ask questions
About the brothers I hang around
What's really goin on in the oakland town
Tell me who went broke, and who got rich
But too $hort baby just ain't no snitch
You say you're just doin your job
But you're gettin on my nerves, just like bob
Everytime I hit a corner, I see you
Always tellin brothers what to do
You lock me up cause I don't know how to act
But I'm down for mine so I be talkin back

I want to be free! (and that's the truth) ohhh yeahhh
I want to be free! ohhh yeahhh
Got out of jail about fo?-fifteen
Walkin down the street like a broke dopefiend
Had a pocket full of money tryin to play the role
Benz got towed and I was hella cold
But I ain't trippin, I'm gettin used to it now
Handcuffed your boy took me straight downtown
For three warrants, had to catch me sooner or later
Cause the five-oh's always tryin to jack a playa
For no reason, wasn't doin nothin wrong
You think I'm lyin, singin that same ol song
Well I'm a black man, ridin in a benz
How in the hell did I make these ends? 	here we go
I pull over to the right
Stop the engine keep my hands in sight
I start cursin, cause it don't make sense
Why would I run and try to jump a fence
If I was plannin, a smooth getaway
I never woulda stopped in the first place
You'd be high speed chasin me but this time you ain't
Cause all I got on me is a big fat bank
And I hope I don't get robbed by you know who
Make me donate some g's to the boys in blue
And if I sue, I won't get nothin back

Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
(He's a playa!...)
He's a pimp, he's a mack
Tilted brim in a Cadillac
(He's a playa!...)
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
[Too $hort:]
I know those who ain't got it, feel like they want it
And those who got it ain't really gotta flaunt it
It's somethin' that we all go through and it's funny
what a nigga do when ya throw him some money
The first thing I bought was a Cadillac
I put the top down, bitch I ain't havin' that
I got a gang of Rolex's, too many cars
Too many broads, I've been doin' hard
Too $hort baby don't play that shit
I love this game and everyday I get
money and hoes, they can't ease past me
If you don't believe me, ask Jazze
[Chorus:]
He got money, he got G's
And the finest H-O-E's
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
(He's a playa!...)
He's a pimp, he's a mack
Tilted brim in a Cadillac
(He's a playa!...)
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
[Too $hort:]
I'm a ghetto celeb well known in the streets
Ain't spent a night all alone in weeks
Anything you players do is never amazin'
Cause $hort got a bitch, for every occasion
And they ain't just black, they spanish and asian
When I come through they say ""Man he's amazin""
I just take two hits, and pass it back
Where you find a white girl with ass like that?
Say it to my face, I can't pimp
Ain't a corner on this earth that I ain't been
Tap my pockets, I'm fat on spinach
I could spend a million dollars in a matter of minutes
[Chorus:]
He got money, he got G's
And the finest H-O-E's
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
(He's a playa!...)
He's a pimp, he's a mack
Tilted brim in a Cadillac
(He's a playa!...)
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
[Too $hort:]
It's all on a bitch, everything I get
From the rims on my whip to the rings I flip
Got a '5 and a '6, you ain't seen my shit?
So clean when I lean with a mean ass grip
I ain't mad at ya player if you're car is loud
Show these motherfuckers what you all about
You got style, like to drive fast and wild?
Pick the girlss with the big ol' ass and smiles
She act foul, you can't hold me down
I burn rubber on a bitch then I'm rollin' out
I do a donut, little kids yellin' wild
They wanna do it, Jazze tell 'em how
[Chorus:]
He got money, he got G's
And the finest H-O-E's
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar
(He's a playa!...)
He's a pimp, he's a mack
Tilted brim in a Cadillac
(He's a playa!...)
Lavish homes and luxury cars
He's a ghetto superstar

You hear me talking you know I'm from the o-a-k
I tell it like it is and that's the only way
I'm the m the a the c the k I write my rhymes everyday
Now all you one-rap rappers what are you doin?
I got so many raps so just go right thru ?em
My name is short but I rap long rhymes
Hand me your mic I do it all the time
Now could you be like me I hate to say it
It's like comparin? mickey d's and quick ways
You only got 3 stores I got the whole wide world
I get beeps everyday from your favorite girl
But I'm such a dog I never call tha freak
Hit it once and she was just too weak
At my house I keep finer things
The candy paints, got her sprung on my diamond rings
She could live like a queen if she was miss too $hort
Have 2 babies, get child support
But at this point she gets nathin from me
I ain't fakin? it, freak, I'm just makin? the beat
So don't dance, ride the strip
All day long playin? too $hort hits
Pop in the tape and start ridin?
Silly young freak who started sidin?

See I'm a true mc, I'm not a mc fool
I'm just rich and famous and way too cool
I get paid to rhyme and I do mean g'z
You don't like my raps don't buy ?em please
I give you no refund cause my bass is phat
Make it hit so hard just like a punch in the back
It's that dopefiend beat got my rap on your plate
Tryin? to bite my style and make a demo tape
Now could you be like me or someone else
Bass hittin? hard like the freaky tales
Oaktown style it goes just like this
If you never heard me rap don't trip
Cause I hit the scene with my homie too clean
We slap hands like a tag team
Some people say they don't like cali raps
People like that must be smokin? that crack
I rhyme good it's been 10 long years
Gettin? sick of all that stuff I always hear
Too $hort can't rap, he's from the westcoast
Between me and you patna I sell the most
So let's take it to the stage and don't get scared
Cause me and too clean, we come well prepared
They call me playboy short, and the girls I play
Every single day

Sixteen stars, rappin over sixteen bars
You ain't never seen big rocks before
Sabotage the show make ?em change the flow
Cash don't make it, put it on hold
Stand back and watch the bitch go gold

Headlights shine, blowing for a hoe
You ain't never seen a freak hop to this
Rock to this, make your nuts fucking wanna pop to this
Too much to dream, tons of cream
Fucking in the limo, listenin my demo
Glisten by the pound
Some smoke weed, some don't fuck around
But check it out, make you freak it when they all alone
The type freak that'll stick you when her momma home

Pushing d-88's, never no trippin
Move out the way and let pit do the mixin
Keep it all smooth, no jackers and haters aloud
One freaky bitch turn the whole fuckin party out
Infatuated by the cheese
Had a group of hoes yellin out ""black please""

"85","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/too_short/in_the_trunk-lyrics-252243.html","too_short","In The Trunk ","It's on
Where they at, where they at, where they at
I sold tapes every day me and Freddy B
Been  famous since 1983
Give me ten dollars, and you straight get blessed
A rap all about you called the special request
Oakland, you know I go way back
To coug nuts, fal stangs, and cadillac's
When homeboys put vogues on any car
With 6 by 9's smoking burners
Everybody got addicted to my dopefiend beat
Whole town fucked around and started smoking D
Every rap I ever made was about this town
I made 7 whole albums with no James Brown
And even though I love his music, I just can't stand
The way they used it all up and didn't pay the man
And after 2 platnum albums, you call me weak
Cause I don't sell records in the East
Now what's funky, I say pussy on an old hoe
I guess y'all fools don't know
Why some good rappers can't sell no tapes
It's not the company's fault, the shit sounds fake
You wanna be in the trunk, with the booming box
While the young bitches ride on your jock
You can't do it like this homey, so just pass it
And stop kissing them white folks asses
It's like you smoked a whole damn key
You rap so fast you keep leaving the beat
I'm from the old school, I love P-Funk
But now rap music is all that they want
So when I'm in my car, I play Clinton
And when I'm on the stage I start pimping
And when I hear your shit, I push eject
Then I throw it out the window with the rejects
And when the hard core rappers go soft
I like to watch when they ass fall off
Cause ain't nothing worth kicking like a sucka MC
And any other rappers ever talk about me
I don't stop rapping, that's all they can say
And how I dogg bitches, every day
But if you can't be a dogg, then you're weak
You be phony like a side show freak
Some rappers try to come off positive
Where I'm from that just ain't how it is
They say rap music is here to stay
But the sucka MC's don't think that way
It took 8 long years before I got my break
So I wonder why rapper's make fake ass tapes
You won't get paid like I did, so give up punk
And while your in the studio, I'm in the trunk
You got no choice, so don't flip that coin
This ain't the military, so you punks can't join
It ain't pop, it's called underground rap
From Oakland California and the shit sounds phat
I'm spitting raps to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I used to be broke, but now we all used to be
Got no game for a bitch, all the game is for me
And these bitches, can't say shit to me
They could never could fuck with Short baby
I'm not a tounge twisting rapper with a funny style
Don't dress hip hop and dance real wild
But I do sell records like a motherfucker
Even though you might I'm just another sucka
I find the beat and then never switch
Grab the microphone and then call you a bitch
You want rent money, I got pimp money
One thing's for sure, I won't give it to a hoe
I throw a bitch in the god damn trunk
And start slamming that Oakland funk
Short Dogg's in the house, once again
Trying to fade the platnum, with Shorty the Pimp
And when I do, I'm going straight to the bank
Withdraw some money and buy some dank
You can't relate to my motherfucking homies
That's why they listen to the one and only
I grew up on the funk called P
But these motherfuckers growing up on me
And if I ego trip, and my head is fucked
I take my ass back, to where I grew up
And get real boy, it's never too late
Before I do like you and make a weak ass tape
I'm in the trunk...
in the trunk, in, in the trunk
in the trunk, in, in the trunk
in the trunk beating down the block
in the trunk, in, in the trunk
in the trunk, in, in the trunk
in the trunk beating down the block

I tell you, nobody does it better than Too $hort
I got so many raps, I know you can't have more
Cause I grew up on the mic, I spent my whole life
Writin raps, late at night
And I never would make no fake LP's
Sucker MC's don't make no g's
They make weak, weak raps, and need to quit
22 songs, and only 3 on hit
Frontin on me like you want some
Better sell a million records, go platinum
Cause I wouldn't waste my time on a one-rap rapper
You wanna get with me, you gotta climb that ladder
But you ain't nothin but a joke
Rappers make money, tell me why are you broke?
We get paid like a muthafucka, and we get
A brand-new house full of brand-new shit
A brand-new car in my brand-new driveway
I always keep the top down on the highway
Too $hort, baby, known everywhere
Had a life-long dream to be a player
Way too cold at a younger age
It was everyday, 'just make that pay'
12 years later, still in the game
And you never talk down on a player's name
Cause I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)

You see, I'm fresh like always with funky beats
I say what's up to the brothers on 10th Street
It's goin down in the Oakland town
Home of the infamous Too $hort sound
So keep your jealous-ass thoughts in your diary
And if you're lookin for a leader, you can hire me
And if your so-called boss don't pay
The only thing you need to say
Is ""I quit, I'm through with you""
Pack up your raps, and join the Dangerous Crew
We got mo' beats than the average joe
And a 24-track studio
So forget what you heard, and we'll see it's on
Oakland, California can't leave me alone
Cause I'm the most rappin, most rhymin
Sold my drop-top, but I'm still high-sidin
I'm (Too $hort, Too $hort)

Now that I've established my career
I wanna help some other brothers out here
Hook em up and let em make some dough
Flip Benzes and turn out shows
Cause Oakland got talent, fool
MC's in elementary school
Not to mention musicians and singers
And Shorty B with his magical fingers
We get funky like skunk weed
Light it up, hit it, and get keed
This dopefiend beat will get you high
If it don't go gold too soon, I'll cry
If the bass ain't deep, somethin's wrong
It must not be a real Too $hort song
Cause the first thing I do when I make my tape
Is drop a few kicks from my 808
And when my tapes hit the store, they sell so quick
You can tell by my big fat royalty check
It's just a Dangerous thing when I'm on the mic
And the local police don't even like
The way we hit your town, it's so funny
It's all about makin big money
So before I go, you should remember this
Muthafuck you, damn shithead bitch

Baby, check this out
Yea you
I wanna ask you a question
Where is yo ass?
Babby, what happened?
A nigga like me I know what's up
I want a nasty bitch with alotta butt
If I can't find one anywhere
It turns my dreams to nightmares
Baby right there ain't got no ass
But she's OK if she's got cash
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
I'll tell you 'bout a day that I had
Seen nothin but bitches with no ass
I woke up early feelin shabby
Got juiced up with a big fat Cabby
Cuz every morning you know I have
A big fat Cabby and a nice hot bath
Just soakin, smokin, Sir Too Short
Thinkin about the day before
Thirty minutes after I woke out
I pulled a freak and took her to the house
She was Eleve Young, with alotta butt
She sucked my dick and then we fucked
That good tight pussy, I wouldn't pass
A light-skinned freak with so much ass
At 1 P.M. I was fuckin away
I wanna do the same thing again today
I want bitches, bitches, and more bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The day my story made itself
Every bitch I saw was flat as hell
I told myself I must need glasses
Where's them bitches with the big brown asses
Me and my group just wanna be tough
Freak two bitches then switch 'em up
It was 3:35, the strip was lit
Every two blocks I seen a bitch
But that ain't nuthin but a cat
None of them bitch didn't have no ass
Wait on the bus, some was walkin
Me and my homie just started talkin
I said, oh, she looks good
He said that ass is flat as wood
I said what about Vicky in the black
He said, Short, she's all that
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The Invasion was on..
Every single day of the week
For every nigga livin there's a freak
If you've got game and a bed
Why not get fucked and get some head
Cuz bitches all over wanna get worked
I just need one with alotta turf
Me and my homie, rollin and smokin
Flat booty bitches took over Oakland
I told my homie, I hate to say
All the bitches with booties stayed home today
And he said Short, what now?
Put the pedal to the metal and hit the B-Town
I thought them bitches out there was fine
But the invasion was on and it fucked my mind
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
We hit the B-Town like Oakland flares
I knew it, bitches was everywhere
The first one had tits so fat
But that don't work, her ass was flat
The second bitch was flat too
I capped on her like a motherfuckin fool
I said be-atch, I know I'm cappin
Where's your ass, baby what happened
She turned around and capped on me
She said, fuck you nigga, where's your teeth
I damn near fell jumpin out the car
But I slapped that bitch, and slapped her hard
My homie said Short we gots to cut
But I was kickin that bitch and her big flat butt
I kicked her ass, got in the ride
Looked at the bitch and said bye bye
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
The invasion was on..
We parked the car and took a walk
I saw another bitch and I had to talk
I said baby, baby, baby come here
Yea you baby with your long long hair
Baby came over from across the street
She was standin on the corner just talkin to me
I was spittin the game but I talked to fast
Cuz I didn't even notice that big flat ass
Shit, and I was ready to go
We was rollin back to the O
I told that bitch I changed my mind
She looked at me and she said why?
I said I'm Sir Too Short, the Oakland player
I'm not one of them niggas who don't care
It's no thang to do my duty
But not with you and yo flat booty
Flat ain't the date superstar
I could see if you was white, but your black as tar
Bitches, bitches, bitches
Invasion of the Flat Booty Bitches
In the Berkeley temp, what did we find?
Freak after freak with no behind
One long day, I never got in
I'm glad that shit never happened again

I got too many girlfriends what am I gonna do?
Play em tell the world ends and always keep a few

Players like me, we never get caught

She give me short, then she'd take my jeans off at
first she wasn't messing with me told me to lick it
but now she's always sweating me. When we gonna kick it?
Spend some time wit her, I need to come through and hit it
Any time I feel like I want it, I can get it
I'll be here for you, you never wonder were I'm at
So when I come through put the spare key under the mat
when I come in, there ain't no holding back
Just feel what I am doing and roll with that
and even though I admit I can't commit this time
it's cause I got my heart broke at the age of nine
I've been hard core every since I sucked up the game from pimps
You never hear me rap about the same bitch
I never turned a hoe into a housewife
Short dog East Oakland in the house right

I thought we was cool like that, why you go behind my back?
Trying to cross me in the game when you know I'm a mack
Can't do that, you all up in my mix
Get the phone book callin all my bitches
You know I don't really care if you interfere
cause I don't think you know about these real players
If you need a lesson, you better listen up
cause I don't think you ready for this pimpin stuff
I'm Too Short baby on the microphone
Since you got no game, I gotta write these songs
To wake you up and get you motivated
I'm about to flip the script and I know your gonna hate it
You can't infatuate my game no more, it's fool proof
So when you try to cross me up, I pull through
like a solider, cause we fighting a war
Haters against Players, who you fighting for?
You all in my business trying to make it theirs
I need to hit you in your face tell you 'mind your own affairs'
I'm Sir Too Short, and I'm knowing just how to be a player bitch
Chorus 2:
Chorus 1:
Too $hort:
BIOTCH
Now if your trying to be a player, do your thing
But if you wanna be in love, it's cool mang
Don't try to be a player when you see that you can't
let your peers pressuring you into being what you ain't
It's hard to be real in this fake world
Would you result to violence if I take your girl?
Or would you realize she likes me more then you
Our relationship is starting and yours is through
Are you riding on the bench. Who you starting for?
Do you have another girl or is your heart broke?
Do you know how to be a player?
Is what they say about me
I'm straight down with the after party, late night freaks.
Belita Woods:
She's just a pretty face, and she doesn't even use her own name

Play em tell the world ends and always keep a few

She give me short, then she'd take my jeans off at
first she wasn't messing with me told me to lick it
but now she's always sweating me. When we gonna kick it?
Spend some time wit her, I need to come through and hit it
Any time I feel like I want it, I can get it
I'll be here for you, you never wonder were I'm at
So when I come through put the spare key under the mat
when I come in, there ain't no holding back
Just feel what I am doing and roll with that

all the homies in the pen straigt locked down
but I gotta get dressed and hit the oaktown
I called Randy ??Olson?? on the telephone
early in the mornin but he still ain't home
so I called Ant Banks to see what's up
he said meet me at the studio at two o'clock
I got dressed, smokin on some serious dank
grabbed my keys off the table and a bid ol bank
I hit interstate 80 and I'm rollin
joint's still burnin and I'm smokin'
I was on my way to San Jose
to the stero shop that make my music play
cause one amp shut down and the bass ain't playin
didn't take long, for Joel and Janks to have me slumpin'
so I called up ??Boo??, what's up nigga what you bout to do
he said, just kickin' back waitin on the fellas

I said it sure sounds good to me
I can't go tho, gotta hit Myrtle Street
passed the acorns on my way, bitch.  it's just anotha day
big Banks came through and started mixin
sittin in the studio kick back listenin
to some funky ass shit from the dangerous crew
Debbie D came through, with FM Blue
Shorty B rolled up smokin' fat ones
Pee-Wee had a crew in the back room
Goldie had the tramps givin head breakin off
rap and rhyme that diddley-dog
twin one and two is tellin stories
bout beatin down niggas for the glory
had to catch a plane that night and roll out of town
everybody gettin high tryin hard to clown
I had to go shop fo its time to leave
I dipped to the mall, flipped me some jeans
rolled on out like a playa
hot ass day, bitches everywhere
I'm leanin' hard to the left like a big shot
checkin out the hoes seein who'll get knocked
cause when you fuck with $hort you get fucked quick
I rub some cum on ya ass and make ya suck dick
ride through the ??old?? scene ??beamin it?? slow
talkin that shit five niggas on the four
drive crazy, tryin to tear up shit
it's just anotha day in Oakland bitch
it was me, Jaque, ??Beamin?? and ??Tilo??
??Boo-kicke?? slow-motion and ??PO??
Spud, Ju-Ju, Frog and Big-E
Gettin high on our street
Bug, Joe-A, Ce-Ce and Mark,
rollin four deep from SobranI Park
Howard came through from the B-Town
motherfuckas gettin high it's goin down
it's the same everyday everyday it's the same
but that night we hit the hoop game
who was playin:  Seattle versus Golden State
hollered at the home boy Gary Payton
after the game, we went to his house
NBA Jams, turned us out
niggas talkin bout slammin bones
any kinda way to get your gamble on
bet, all you kept hearin was bet
dice game on the pool table fuck that shit
I ain't goin outa town broke
I gotta have a bank get some dank to smoke
think I'm gamblin, you must be insane
it started gettin late I had to catch that plane
so I cut to the airport
just anotha day for Too Short
I was high as fuck on the airplane
thinkin to myself about a street gang
how a black man'll do you in a minute
walk around the corner see some shit and get in it
how the police always tryin to catch us
fell asleep and woke up in Houston, Texas
gangtas ass niggas from the fifth and the third
take yo ass there nigga fuck what ya heard
next night we did a show, in New Orleans
same gangstas same old scene
yellin at seventh at ninth ward
I see my homies from the third and the fourth
it was me Big Dog and the ??eight guard?? posse
havin fun and you just can't stop me
I did a show in Birmingham, Alabama
then caught a plane in Atlanta
I heard about the motherfuckin freaknick
popped that pussy hole fuck that weak shit
you shoulda seen all the bitches on the street
niggas from Detroit was deep
all my patnas from the 'O' flew up
and they was slangin that danky stuff
gettin high with some brothers from MiamI and Cleveland
kickin back talkin bout we ain't leavin

Right right right
[Verse One]
I know you love me, I'm like a habit
But if you had a million dollars, could I have it?
If I was broke and starvin, would you feed me?
If I drove a big car, would you see me?
While I'm foldin yo' money in half
If you was holdin on down to yo' last
You know I need it, everything you got
I gotta get it or we'll never see the top
If it was a Happy Meal, or a half-a-mill
It's the same thing baby, that's real
Don't matter if you're holdin out, no doubt
If you fuckin Ludacris bitch, +Rollin' Out+
With a Chinese name, Won Gone
Pack yo' bags, and get the fuck on
It's understandable, why I do what I do
Gettin money every day and I'm still comin through, right..
[Chorus]
I'm a woman that'll hold you down
When the other ones can't be fou-ounnnd, that's right
I'm a woman that'll keep you rich
When the others want you to tri-iiiick - that's right
[Verse Two]
I need team players, to roll with
Get down with an O.G., knowin it
Would you mix Hennessy, with Tanqueray?
Let me fuck yo' best friend every day
Would you walk from Compton to Hollywood
From Richmond to Oakland I got it good
From the Soul Train Awards to the Grammys
From New York City to Miami
If I went to jail, would you bail me out?
If I went through hell, would you help me out?
Get a king and have better things
Sell your grandmomma's wedding ring
Unconditional love, would you donate yo' kidneys?
I wanna know how much would you give me
Let my dawg hit it, matter fact let us all get it
Break somethin off on it, right..
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
I woke up one day in the A-T-L
With a pocket full of money feelin way too real
Thinkin bout what happened 'fore I went to sleep
I'd be broke if it wasn't for the pimp in me
Read my mind, I want what you got
Top down girl, bumpin Tupac
You got too much money in your freak pants
That's why I keep my ladies in a deep trance
From January to December
She can't remember, her mind's in a blender
Wake up in the back of a Caddy
Don't even know who's your momma or your daddy
The name is Too $hort
I'm addictive like Newports, but of course
you can fight the feelin if you want to
But this game might come back to haunt you, right..

I love things about you (it's alright) you got it going on
I'm not in love and this is not a love song, but you've been down for so long
You should never be wrong, I know it's all my fault
My mind been gone, I'm always on the chase
Lipstick on my face, when I get home
You gotta get on my case, cause I've been fuckin' up
Coming home smelling like her, I can't fuck it up
Call your mama tell her how it hurts, tell her
I'm a dog, but don't say that's all
I came in first place at the players ball, and now I got my skrill on
My new grill on, put you through some shit girl
But I know you're real strong, you say I never find a real one like you
But I never take the time to feel like you, I put the game down
The way it's suppose to be, don't be a punk ass bitch, just get open with me
Too Short talking:
Cause I'm a real player. A-yo Pimp C I don't think they feel us.
Pimp C:
There's a very thin line between love and hate
And there's a very thin line between a fuck and a date
Girl you know when I was hollering at you
I want to hit, I ain't got time to get caught up over a girl and lose my grip
I'm screaming ""Steady pimp"" you steady trying a change me
Running that game your mama taught you, bitch that shit don't faze me
Say bitch I'm Pimp C, I shall be seen again
But all that shit your cousin toldyou has gone in the wind
Just cause I pimp my pen, you think you moving in
Like I'm a trick I'm a let you have half of everything I spend
You talking week rent, I'm trying to whip a Benz
Flipping the club with pimps like Too Short, baby lady friends
Talking bout your sister saw me with a brand new bitch at the club
Coming at me wiht high school shit, bitch you must be in love
Space Age, new faze, I done payed the price
Hoping you ain't bout to rip my stable, she said I'm shift
But bitch that's alright
Pimp C talking:
You can keep your funky ass pussy, you know what I'm saying? Straight up.
What's up Short?
Too Short:
Shit go back to pimpology man. These hoe know it's alright though and if
they don't Bun will let them know.
Bun B:
Baby you're hangin' on a rope, it's getting crucial like dope
I can't cope, I guess the situation has lost all hope
Cause you've obviously flipped your lid, but what's done is did
I'm putting youup for sale for the highest bid
Or an ass from kid shit, you got me twist-ed
Little Bun won't be another statist-ic, this love affair went ballist-ic
Puttin' them messy ass hoes up in my mix like Bisquick
And thinkin' you gonna leave Big Bun juiced like mystic
Nigga believe me shit's thick, loves lost
nothing's gained but confusion about the pain
You losing about the same, you can't tame, a wild animal
Feeding lettece to a cannibal, make a grown man wear goranibals
And I can't handle, bullshit that's unnessessary
You can't handle being with a G, I guess it's scary
It's the very thing that put us together seperated us
Player hated us, and things will never be the way it was
I hate to say it cause, but find another shoulder to cry on
Stop gettin' your lie on, baby it's alright
Too Short talking:
I wanna dedicate this song to my bitch, quit tripping and bring your ass
home, baby I love you, al long as you got my money
Pimp C talking:
You know what I'm saying? It's 199 reits, know what I'm sayin', straight up
pimpin', you know what I'm talking about, I'm trying to see some papers,
some dead ones.
Bun B talking:
Some real shit going on, you know what I'm saying? This is Big Bun and I'm
out with my nigga Short and my nigga Pimp C. You know how players is with
bitches on your dick.
Pimp C talking:
Pimping ain't dead, they just scared you know what I'm talking about?

Cause these ladies ain't feelin' you
They don't wanna know what you can really do
They just wanna make you disappear

Take that shit back over there
Go away, she don't wanna know you player

Bitch you goin' home in a taxi cab
No more limos, run the meter
We might need stitches, this one's a bleeder
Grab yo' shit girl, it's time to go

Another time on another day
We could hook up, make love and play
It really can't happen no other way
Girl do you hear what a brotha say?
Don't leave anything in my room
I got another freak, she'll be here soon
She might not be, as wild you
It's 4 AM and right now she'll do
She's not a super freak, and she's not a hoe
But when she gets here, you gotta go

We had fun, but now I'm through with you
I gotta run, I'll call you in a few days
I'll be back, to get some more cooch-ay
Cause you do it, better than most
At this rate, we'll probably never be close
But that's okay, 'cause that's not the mission
You could cheat on your man if you got permission
I'll give it to ya, I'll beat it so well
When we finished, we gotta leave the hotel
That's all... I'm the #1 Player
You can call, or I'll see you somewhere
As long as we make this happen again
Yo' fine ass sittin' back in the Benz
Cause yours is the best, I must confess
But right now, it's time to get dressed

I was at my house not doing anything
Half past ten I heard the phone ring
When I picked it up, I said ""Hello?""
The bitch spoke up and said ""What's up ho?""
I said, ""Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick""
Enough playing, who the fuck is this?
She said ""Janet"" I said ""Oh""
Met the bitch last week at my show
I told her ""Call me"" and I gave her my card
She talked dirty and my dick got hard
That night I fucked the bitch three times straight
Next night we made another date
I gave a concert and she came backstage
Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid
But that puusy squeezed tighter than a vice grip
Fucked around and met this other bitch
Right out the back I told her ""Bitch let's go""
Took the bitch to my limo even though
Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh
She told her friend they fuck the best
Rushed the bitch to the back seat
She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me
She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out
Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth
She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it
The limo door opened, it was Janet
She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit
I kicked back and let 'em have this dick
I told the driver ""Take me straight home""
Then called my partner on the car phone
I said ""I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch""
Come to my house and don't even trip
He came over and we served the hoes
Fucked the bitches like gigalos

It's that high
The pussy's just like dope
It's that dope
Even, if, you don't, want no mo'
Even if you don't want no mo'
The pussy's just like dope
First time you got a shot, you was hooked
When she walked into your life, you never shoulda looked
Ain't no rehab for pussy, it won't hurt me
You just like cigarettes and goin cold turkey
That's all you ever think about
Nasty ass hoes'll give you stank mouth
First thing in the morning, she's on your mind
Twenty minute kisses, all the time
Bomb ass head, hit it from the back
She be ridin yo' dick like a horse bareback
You ever wonder where she learned that?
The bitch'll pull a pimp's perm back
Special handlin, dick's the package
It's mine - you gon' let me have it back bitch?
Good pussy make you fall in love
You better say no to drugs
Chorus: Too $hort
It's like heroin (heroin, heroin)
The pussy's just like dope
Even, if, you don't, want no mo'
The pussy's just like dope
[Too $hort]
I chose to say no to drugs
Pussy throw them thangs beat yo' ass like thugs
Have you whipped, creamin in yo' hand and shit
Call her every day and can't stand the bitch
You old pussy ass sucker niggaz
still love hoes that fuck other niggaz
Can't tell you nothin, you need counselin
Fuck that shit, keep poundin it
I'm talkin bout some stay wet,
bustin big nuts in her face shit
Dick thrustin like a spaceship
Red snapper's what I call that pussy
Why you askin stupid questions like would she
suck yo' dick -- you ain't know?
It was passed down to her from her kinfolks
Momma and her aunties was freaks
Kryptonite pussy got you weak
Chorus
[E-40]
Uh-huh.. OOOH!
Some of these bitches is garden tools, and I don't mean shovels
I mean hoes HOES experts at workin they pussy muscles
Literally (??) over these hoes, niggaz'll fight and scrap for
But see I don't play that shit, I beat a bootch down with a belt buckle
The first thing you wanna do is go down on a botch, and eat her crabby
KNOWIN that there botch still got lead in her ass from yesterday
I'm on your botch -- size 44D bodacious breasts
but the bitch got mo' miles on her THAN SOUTHWEST
Don't, you, get it dis-com-bob-u-la-ted (discombobulated)
She used to have a 70's bush - until I shaved it (until I shaved it)
Beatch, beatch!
Now you all in front of her momma's house, blowin your horn
(blowin your horn) All in front of her momma's house, blowin your horn
Suicide, dial that girl for help?  (help?)
Shot up her fam' BAM, returned to grind on yourself

[Too $hort]
Man look at her, baby look good
The way she dancin, maybe I should
step up to her, and run this game
I wanna FUCK - I don't wanna know her name
I play the role though, act like I'm interested
By the end of the night, she done been molested
And she loves it, that's how I do it
You tried to get with her too but you blew it
I told her I ain't had no woman, I got three
And you ain't leavin this club without me
cause I'll be - your breakfast in the mornin
See the sun rise while you're nake and you're moanin
And when I get up, talkin like a pimp
That's when reality, starts to sink in
You want me to fuck yo' pussy 'til it hurts
And I wanna put yo' fine ass to work, bitch
[Chorus]
Bitches always tellin me
you're a player (a real player)
I don't care about these other hoes
Just keep fuckin me (keep it up in you, way up)
[Too $hort]
I can look in yo' eyes and see I got you
You so fine girl I had to knock you
We left the bar, we in the car
I'm treatin this bitch like a movie star
It's all game, I just wanna hit it quick
Try to turn a bitch out so I can hit a lick
And it's a trip, she's such a good bitch
Mama told you bout niggaz that look slick
You knew about the hoes when you met me
I'll add you to my stable if you let me
So you can get me, what I need so quickly
I want G's bitch, about a hundred fifty
All these hoes, know my style
I'll put you to work but don't go too wild
Cause we'll get this cash, just take our time
Choose or leave, you better make up yo' mind

Bitches always tellin me (what dem hoes say?)
you're a player (that's right, I'm a fuckin player bitch)
I don't care about these other hoes (na nah)
Just keep fuckin me
[Too $hort]
You said put it all up in you, keep on fuckin you
Knew what time it was and I knew just what to do
Bitch I get at you, have you stuck like a statue
Use nothin but words and I have you
I give a fuck if you think I'm too rich
I ain't gon' cash you out like these new tricks
She wanna eat, drink and fuck good
That won't make you get my cash, but what would?
If I turned you on to this player life
Quit fuckin rich niggaz tryin to be a wife
I can show you how to put this game to work
Don't do it, unless you put some change in yo' purse
Bitch you know whassup wit me
I'm from the O, I roll in luxury
I mack broads, and smoke big buds of weed
Can't be a ho when you always fuck for free, beitch!
[Chorus]
Bitches always tellin me (tellin you what?)
you're a player (.. that ain't no lie)

Head cross on fo'-head, five-eight with her shoes on
She said ""I want what you want"", now I'm at her home and I'm fuckin on her futon
Like girl let's do some'n, I ain't gone cum you cum
Homegirl got a true monkey, monkey wanna call that two-some
Come through, with henny and coke, plenty of smoke, plenty of the folks just with me
We ball out pretty, we told on twentie's, we fall out shitty
So if y'all not with me, y'all see me mob with two ho's
Y'all see em' slob on my knob, mobbin' my bob
Y'all drivin' too close
[Too Short]
I know you from Chi-town, pimp her
Break a bitch and lie down in her
Make a little church girl a sinner
Dont worry im finna', put her in a skirt and send her to work
Big pimpin' on the turf, she better use it til' it hurts
Put the money in her bra and not her purse
Bitch, make that cocky glass then panties always drop fast
Dont ever stuff that ass, just hit me when you got my cash

15, 16 and all so young
I thought about you just last night
Grabbed my pen then I started to write
A rap that'll cap like a true blue rap
Not a washed-up almost MC sap
Little girls so fresh and I know you are
Wanna take a little ride in my new car
I see you more than baby, it's more like hell
You screw a little girl and end up in jail
Even though she seems she's 19
You're looking at her body an it's breaking the jeans
Well you know she's not, so don't play dumb
Little girls walking round trying to give me some
But I tell 'em like this, I'm the player $hort
Playing freaks like you is just a sport
I'm coming way too real and I can never be funny
Niggas like me just want your money
Give it up, cause I'm no lost cause
Little girl recognize Too $hort's the boss
When they turn 16, we all find out
What little girls like that are all about
So you girls out there, that fit my rhyme
You'd better think twice before you jump on mine
Little girl's so thick, you might think she's grown
But if you knew when she was born, you might leave her alone
She's trouble homeboy, with a big fat ""T""
Little girls like that make old men pee
Then a brother like me might break my neck
Looking back saying ""Ooooh!"" Bout to get in a wreck
Cause she's always flirting, might give me a look
Like I put her in the oven and she started to cook
But when I put her on the spot, she could not hang
With my so rough, so tough Playboy game
I only said two words, something like ""Get busy""
Her head started hurting and she got real dizzy
Growing up to fast, all you little girls
Letting brothers like me cold crush your world
Should've listen to your momma when she told you so
But you wnet and got G'd now you want some more
They ain't paying me money, talking bout love
And the other girl's who I'm thinking of
Can you understand, I'm just a man
I want to come in this world and cold take the man
So just step on back, while I walk on by
I might look you down, and I might say ""Hi""
And if you come up choosing, I just might laugh
Say ""Little girl check me out in about two and a half...years""
I took a little girl to a drive in show
Jumped in the back and heard ""No no no""
She was only 16 but the girl was ripe
36-24 and a 35
I was wasting time spitting lines
Thinking bout going home cold getting mine
Baby said ""Stop it"" I said ""Drop it""
I tried everything but I could not cop it
I was going to a store about a month ago
Met another girl that just loved my show
We talked for a while and it was all about
Having big fun later on at her house
She said her pops was gone but her mother was there
And everything was cool cause she don't care
So I gave her a ride, kissed her goodbye
I said I'd be back and we all know why
Went to find my thrill up on that hill
I was coming right back with the power drill
I had fun for a while but it wasn't enough
When it all got good, her pops showed up
He must have walked in the room and said ""Young punk""
Cause when he walked in the room, he smelled the funk
Then he tried to mash, but I don't play
Cause I was out of that window and on my way
Little girl
Every night you call and say ""Come by""
You tell me things changed and I know you lie
I came by last week, you said drive on up
And your pops came out talking all that stuff
Next night we made a date for 9 o'clock
And I always wondered why you walked the block
I saw you waiting on the corner when I made the turn
I didn't really think about it cause I wasn't concerned
I said, ""You look so good, but you always do""
I was rushing to the house for the old 1 2's
But the ones ain't cool, and the twos don't work
Every time I tried, you kept saying it hurts
And then it all came out under all your tears
It seems you only been alive for 15 years
You could have fooled me baby with your lying scheme
Said you worked in the mall and just turned 18
When it came down to it, I couldn't go through it
It's all so sad cause you wanted to do it
Little girl, you want to have some fun
You'd better wait a few years cause you're much too young
Stop playing games, you might find a guy
Who will like you for yourself, not for all your lies
So I put it like this, and I don't play
If I see your young ass, I'm not going your way
You little girl

Somebody let him know.. tell that nigga
His bitch is out of pocket
[Verse One]
It was me and yo' broad, ridin in my 'llac
She tried to climb on top of me and slide on my lap
I said hold on baby, we almost to the spot
We gon' do somethin nasty, with all this lust you got
I fucked her on the floor then we got up in the bed
Woke up in the mornin, can't remember what we did
Last night we was drunk, stinkin dirty motherfuckers
Stayed up all night, 'til 7:30 can't touch us
When we down on the beach, in the sand in Miami
I done found me a freak, done got my hand in her panties
She was playin in the water, MAN she was wet
So I laid her on her back, I pulled her panties to the left
I told her.. naww baby, we ain't do it too soon
Straighten up your dress, let's go up to my room
Tell your man you was lost, ran into a boss
Then I opened that ass up like a can of sauce
[Chorus]
We don't like those lollypops
Sucker ass niggaz don't know how we rock
They can't even handle it
When you tell the truth, they can't stand a bitch
We don't like those lame marks
that run the other way when the game starts
Cause they don't know what to do
Don't lie tell me why would I fuck with you
[Verse Two]
Stop hatin since we datin the same lady
Don't hate the player, hate the game baby
I like her style, she's kinda wild
And when we do it we don't waste time goin out
We into it like the X-Rated flick with no plot, it's so hot
Don't hesitate and don't stop 'til we on top
She got a dude - but what I gotta prove?
Ain't no need to creep, you know she's a freak
Take it all, 'til the balls, disappear in her jaws
Then she take off them drawers, let me hit them sugar walls
And when I'm done havin fun tryin to be a player
She kiss my thang goodbye and say I'll see you later
Now if you can't take it mayne you need a good girl
Take a ride around the town and try to look for her
Cause yo' wife's a hoe, you might like to know
If she see a big dick, she might go..
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
I watched her eye, she witcha man, stop starin
Stop the lies, there's no comparin
You wanna ride well let's go; I got a magic carpet with vogues
I'm nice to the ladies but I'm hard on the hoes
And when you jump in my car bumpin ""Freaky Tales""
You told me pull it out, you wanna see it's real
I know your type girl, you ain't fin' to wait
That's how a pimp taste ridin on the interstate
It's in your mouth, make you wanna scream and shout
You can swallow or spit, when the cream comes out - bitch!
Just don't tell your man
Cause whores start wars when they know they can
I understand, you really wanna do me
Dance to a slow jam, ""Feelin' on Your Booty""
And after tonight, when you kick it with a real one
All them fake-ass niggaz you ain't even gon' feel 'em (hell nah)

I might be young, but I spit this game
I start it with P, and it ends the same
If your brain is lame, remember the name
When it's Too $hort baby, ain't nothing plain
Dangerous Music on the microphone
Makes you wanna break your hip bone
Might break your leg, or maybe your back
Grooving to hard to my mack attack
It's really not easy, you know it's hard
Sort of just like my gangster car
You know what I mean, Vern? It's like funny
I mack legit and make all the money
See my capital T on my diamond ring
We hook up the beat and love to swing
So while you're out there grooving back and forth
I want you to scream out ""Sir Too $hort"" (Sir Too $hort!)
Don't stop that rap (Don't stop that rap!)
And it's just like that
Get buy girls, while I rap
I make big money, that ain't no crap
When I grab that mic, and spit my rhymes
I gotta have an 8 or 909 BEAT
So I can rock you all night long, SHE'S
On my tip, she love my song, HE
Tried to do it but did it wrong, FREAKS
Want to get my all alone, but I'm macking
I finally got a chance to grab my pen
And make another rhyme so I can make more ends
It's a rush production, not the beat
I rushed it out the studio and hit the street
Now I'm rocking one more time
Young girls love my Too $hort rhyme
But that big fat girl better let that go
Before I point right at her say ""Ho!""
I'm riding drop-top Caddy, I don't dip fake
I step on the gas then I hit the break
Do it again as I catch the beat
You're feeling that bass all down the street
Jumped out the car on 9-0
I was wearing all white Capezio
Had my 501's, five dunkey ropes
Couldn't be saved by John the Pope
The M, A, C and K, from Oakland, California
I'm Too $hort baby, no I don't play, I'm macking
Freak nasty, I like your dance
You know it looks good in those pants
So damn good, I had to glance
Now I'm macking
See this gold? I bought it all
Now every night you young freaks call
You see my car? It's my best friend
So it you touch, you'll meet your end
Time will tell, just keep it cool
Don't play that game, don't be no fool
I'll burn rubber all down your block
You know what I want so keep the door unlocked
I'm coming in baby, don't waste no time
It's a mack attack, and now you're mine
Dangerous Music is what it seems
The reason this floor just met those jeans
I was running the game all in your ear
You're talking bout love to a stone cold player
Girl look good and wanna have that sex
Took another look and wanted to break that neck
It's a mack attack, coming from way back
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
I'm from the Dangerous Crew, and I know it's true
The only thing you'll say about Playboy Too
Is I'm macking

If you're lookin for a baller, baller

Whassup baby? Still dreamin?
For a rich man, you still fiendin?
Well I hope he got skills if you know what I mean
Everything from oral sex, to cookin and cleanin
Rich niggaz want it all, just like you
And when I ball don't ask me what I do
You wanna be kept, keep yo' mouth shut
But youse a golddigger and you go out too much
If I choose you, it'll be the wrong choice
I'm sayin fuck you loud, with a strong voice
One rainy day and yo' ass is out
No money to spend, you start passin out
So dramatic, even though it ain't yo' cash
Bitches like you I wanna thank yo' ass
for bein shallow, I know you a bad ho
I wouldn't let yo' punk-ass stand next to my shadow
[Chorus]
[Too $hort:]
I like a Cinderella story, but most of the time
These nothin-ass golddiggin hoes are fine
A nigga frontin, you wanna have sex with a star?
He drive a Benz, but it's the next nigga car
The only thing he own is that outfit
But he still stuck his dick in yo' mouth bitch
And after all that gettin fucked on the floor
He called a taxi to take you home in the mornin
Dumb bitch, you just got fucked by a flunkie
See you at the club and you actin like you want ME
Don't make me laugh
We get married, and you take half
I don't think so, see you at the bank ho
You wanna walk down the aisle but I cain't go
I got her number, but I never call her
You better look around and find another baller, beotch!
[Chorus]
[Too $hort:]
I don't want yo' key, you ain't gettin mine
Ask to use my car, you commitin a crime
Leave yo' panties or yo' bra, I throw 'em away
Cain't find the door? I show you the way
Hope you come back, but you just cain't stay
We can get together on another day
I come get you, when I miss you
Cause if I see you every day I'd probably diss you
What'chu gon' do when you get you a baller?
Rich man, what she gotta do to get you to call her?
Better talk about, might like what you hear
Say it right in her ear, every night of the year
You can be together, beotch!
You better get a job if you wanna be rich
Go to school or somethin, get a degree
I know you wanna baller but it can't be me

I drink g-juice and wouldn't cut it with ice
>From the Eastside baby, Oakland town
Can't understand why I'm so down?
I'm not a whitewall, I'm a vogue
Like a Zenith wire wheel I roll
Got a fresh new beat, made to get freak
It was everything you wanted cause I can't be weak
Yeah baby that's it, do the split
Freak nasty all on my tip
I took it to my DJ fresh on wax
Put it on the turntable, I got taps
It started burning up, wires smoking
Had to be the sound coming straight from Oakland
$hort Dog, it's a mack attack
My name is Too $hort baby, I don't play that jack
One young tender lost all hope
Slapped her in the face with my dunkey rope
Another young sucker tried to front my staff
Saw it on his face when they broke him in half
It was the Dangerous Crew, and I tell you it's true
Everything they say about Playboy Too
When I say my rhymes, I'm never fake
When you start my beat, that's when I break
On you, and it don't stop, and it don't stop, and it won't stop

I'm not a wannabe pimp, I never simp

I see that expression on your face is blank
Look like, you need a little extra space to thank
I'ma put somethin on yo' mind, no doubt
Let me take a long ride inside, yo' mouth
I don't care if the police, run my plates
I got a top notch with me, and one on the way
And we gon' do it all night 'til the sun come up
'Til they both quit and ask me if I done enough
But that's a never endin story how I dogged these hoes
Tryin to run game, bitch I heard it all befo'
It's just me and you baby, some wine and some weed
Now you wanna do the 69 with me
On a sex mission, to the next position
A lot of extra lickin, you know the definition
of a fantasy, can it be true?
Another rendezvous, just me and you
Bitch I'm married

[Too $hort]
Don't hide your face baby, stand in the light
Fuck this shit just hand me the mic
Some of y'all hoes don't be dancin right
You can't be a pro when it's amateur night
Curiosity, killed your cat
Kick back, and listen to a real one rap
I'm spittin this game, girl you feelin that?
Open them thighs, let me peel it back
Bitch, you so professional
Can't hold back, baby let it go
Why you wanna test a hoe
Send her to the track, let her flip your roll
She said, ""Too $hort baby don't be that way
I've been lovin you ever since back in the day
Now you wanna break me and take my cash
Make me get naked, and shake my ass""
Bitch you got that right
You better do it all day and don't stop at night
Don't make me hurt yo' ass
You can gimme those gifts but I prefer cash
Ain't no stoppin that
I ride down the street with the top in the back
When I was young, I swore I'd never change
Cause I'm all about the money and I'm married to the game

Short Dog's in the house, once again with this pimp shit
Chorus:
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah
Verse 1: Too $hort
I met this girl in Atlanta
She let a nigga fuck but I still can't stand her
The pussy wasn't good I said ""What's up bitch?
I'm tired of fuckin' can you suck dick?""
She said ""No"", but she had another friend
So I switched like a real pimp
Laying on my back with my dick in her mouth
I said ""Beyotch!!  What you talkin' 'bout?""
She mumbled something, I don't know what she said
Smoking on a joint gettin some bomb-ass head
Bitch said her name was Theresa
All on my dick like cheese on pizza
In the A-T-L where the grass is greener
I fucked Nina, Melina, Sabrina and Tina
When I first moved out there, I met Holly
Five-foot one with a bad ass body
Freaky little bitch she was a Gemini
She used to stand up and say ""Shoot it in my eye!""
I met another girl went to Spellman College
Every day after school I aquired the knowledge
I took her to my house so I could get some
I fucked her real good and made the bitch cum
She was hella limber, said her name was Amber
She wouldn't stop screaming, that's all I remember
I had another freak, her name was Wendy
When I first met the bitch she said ""Please don't pimp me!""
I did it anyway
I'm coming straight from Oakland, C-A
Ain't no other way, like my girl Shante
She lives in Atlanta, but she comes from the Bay
Let me hit that hometown pussy on the strimp
Look out for a nigga, treat me like a pimp
You know I can't forget about the strippers
Cinderella with the glass slipper
Top down in the Benz ain't spendin' no ends
Fat bag of indo, bring all your friends
It's like Lotto, you get a quick pick
Bitches said they heard I had a big dick
So I showed it to 'em, only took one second
Dick rock hard, bitches gettin' nekked
Chorus:
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah
Verse 2: Too $hort
I know another bitch, her name is Terri
I lied to the bitch ""It's about time I get married""
I couldn't see me pimpin' her
So I fucked her next door neighbor, Jennifer
She had two roommates, Cindy and Amy
Terri caught me creepin' and said ""Nigga don't play me!""
But them hoes liked to freak
I used to send 'em new niggas every other week
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
I spent the night with Monique in between the sheets
It was her, her girlfriend April and me
I do it on the regular, two at a time
Call it what you want I be a fool wit' mine
Like them Texas niggas, I never would change
Like my niggas up in Cleveland spit the good game
These hoes recognize when I come in the door
I ain't trickin bitch, so what you want me for?
Like Natalie, swearin' up and down I had to be the one
Bitch lets have some fun
I fucked her, you thought I didn't
Short Dog's in the house and I keep on pimpin'
So then I fucked the twins, Sharon and Karen
Went straight for the panties, but they wasn't wearin 'em
Don't ask me who I fucked first, it ain't my fault
In the end, I still got the same results
Chorus:
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna have sex say hell yeah
Verse 3: Too $hort
Hell yeah, I never would forget Charlene
We was layin real close like two sardines
Talkin', laughin', kissin' and shit
Next thing I know she started kissin' my dick
You know the rest, before she left I paged Mia
I told her ""I got a new freak over here""
She rushed over, I left and when I came back
Them hoes was lickin' cats
They call me ""Short"" when I'm pimpin', ""Dog"" when I'm mackin'
Gotta get the money, thats all thats happenin'
She wants to be my love slave, I need some bug spray
To keep these hoes away
I never would tell you all the hoes I fucked
These are the tales, some of this shit I made up
I change the name so I can rhyme and shit
So if it's you, you know the time bitch!
These are the tales, the freaky tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
For fifteen years I've been a real player
So if you wanna get fucked say hell yeah (hell yeah)
Beyotch!
And it don't stop
Old school Short Dog
Still spittin' it
Still gettin' it
Gettin' that money

Make a real player wanna give you a tip
You move so sexy, I love the way you wiggle
Your titties bounce around and your big booty jiggles
Make the video, it's official
Throw the stiff hoes out the game, blow the whistle

Eyes get pussy hoe, shake that ass
You're like the 84 but rich, cause it's sittin on glass
Ain't nothin happenin but tricks gettin broke

Every nigga that she fuck got some kind of contract
R&B singers, ballplayers and rappers
Niggaz call back cause the bitch got a snapper

The tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, her name was Joan
She loved the way I rocked the microphone
When I met Joan, I took her home
She was just like a doggy all on my bone
I met another girl, her name was Ann
All she wanted was to freak with a man
When I met Ann, I shoked her hand
We ended up freakin' by garbage can
The next young freak I met was Red
I took her to the house and she gave me head
She likes to freak was all she said
We jumped in the sheets and we broke my bed
There's another girl, her name is Mary
Talked about sex and the girl acted scary
I heard she was freakin' for my homeboy Jerry
Took her to the house and I popped that cherry
Young and tender, sweet Denise
Get her in the bed and the girl's a beast
I tell you, homeboy, If you get a piece
She only talks about signin' a lease
I met this tender, her name was Lori
And a X-rated movie wouldn't tell her story
She had a twin sister, her name was Lisa
And just like Lori, she's a real dick pleaser
My girlfriend's name was Michelle,
her booty was bigger than a tale on a whale, I freaked her well
Her pussy got hotter than flames in hell
I geed this girl, her name was Tammy
I didn't wanna do it cause the bitch was flammy
She had a best friend, her name was Jane
I pulled to the side and I spit that game
I met a lot of freaks in my lifespine
Freaked one night with a girl named Pam
The very next day I saw her with her man
One week passed and I was in her again
I had an old tender, her name was Janien
She was thirty-two and I was only eighteen
She likes to freak, she's just a fiend
It really didn't matter when I saw her in jeans
I wanna big freak, fat and slobby
I kick on back and I watch her mouth
Two tons of fun, big mama jama
A country-girl from Alabama
I met this feak, her name was Betty
Her pussy got wet and it smelled like death
I was tired as hell, I was drippin' sweat
But I was all up in her tryin' to hold my breath
Bake and shake us, I met this freak in Vegas
She said her name was Donna
She was a built little freak from China
I said I don't pimp or gigolo
I'm havin' so much money that I don't need a hoe
You can break yourself but you can't break me
You never met a player like $hort, baby
I knew a dick sucker named Betty-Jo
Took her to my home and we did it on the floor
The girl got freaky and I tell you more:
She was down on her knees beggin' to blow
She's like another freak named Rene`
You get her alone and she'll make your day
Like Burger King, she knows the play
But a freak like Rene`, you can have it your way...
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
These are the tales that I tell so well...
I met this girl, thick as hell
Only sixteen, said her name was Linell
I took her to my house, I could not wait
Her shit was much tighter than Central Safe
Let me tell you this since we talkin' young
I met another girl, said her name was Yvonne
Always talkin' about havin' fun
Once again in the bed I got it goin' on
I'm Sir Too $hort, couldn't be no punk
I try to get funky like female funk
So when you see me comin' or see me goin'
I keep my money, let the hoes keep throwin'
I once met a tender, she did it for free
On the Foothill bust number forty-three
All the way on the back she was workin' me
Had my big beatbox and I was jammin' the beat
I met this freak named Antuinet
Macked on the baby like an ice-cold vet
Everythin' she had is what I get
Cause I'm Too $hort, baby, I don't play that shit
I met another freak, her name was Rita
Baby thought that $hort just might eat her
I told her like this, she can suck my peter
Or even go home cause I knew I didn't need her
Scratched her name off my telephone book
Never again I took a second look
Cause the next young freak, her name was Sharon
She kept lookin', well, I kept stairin',
baby came through with my homeboy Darron
Her booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'
She never left, he cutted out
I know you all know what I'm talkin' about
There's a freak named Shane, such a sinner
She smokes that pipe and she's gettin' thinner
Shane is cool but her mind is gone
One fat rock and it's goin' on
She had another buddy, came by my place
Thick ass bitch, said her name was Grace
She walked in the door wearin' a lace
she walked in da door working late
You shoulda seen that look that was on my face
She's like this tender named Belinda
Homeboys call her Belinda the Blender
She gave head like she made it up
She was twenty years old with a big round butt
Had a girl slick like olive oil
Her father was rich and the girl was spoiled
When she got mad he blood would boil
But I rapped her all up like aluminum foil
These are the tales, the freaky tales...
The tales that I tell so well...
Shockedy life, Friday night, it's goin' on Too $hort
Three weeks ago I met this freak
She followed me around like Mary's sheep
I hitted around the corner and when she came
I grabbed her by the arm and I asked her name
She said it was Nina and her man's in Santa Rita
I took her to my home and homeboy, I geed her
Set her on the way the very next way
Playboy $hort was ready to play
I bumped to this girl, her name was Roseanne
We hitted the motel and got it goin' on
Holiday Inn to the break of dawn
When I took baby home, I freaked her mom
I knew this tender named Shanie
I took her to the house and let her freak on me
Baby was a fan, she loved my beat
But I wouldn't raise my leg to let her kiss my feet
I met this freak named Yolanda
Rolled baby doll like a brand new Honda
I was on top and she was up under
The bed hitted the wall and it sounded like thunder
I once had a datewith girl named Kitty
She was so fine with big fat tiddies
All night long she was actin' shitty
So i macked on baby like I was Frank Nitti
There's another girl, her name is Rose
I use to roll baby like brand new Volvos
I never saw Rose wearin' clothes
She's a pent house pet, ready to pose
I was ridin' down the street when I met Janet
Her booty was bigger than the whole damn planet
Ass everywhere, I just can't stand it
Tried to pomit it but I could not manage
I had this freak, her name was Bunny
Said I was the only man who ever called her honey
Everythin' I did to her was funny
I macked on bunny and I took her money
Eight tonight a date with Shirlie
She was really short and her hair was curly
If you saw baby you liked this girlie
She was so fine I went to get her early
Shirlie was freakin' like a girl named Rachel
Her bite was vicious and it sure was fatal
She liked to kiss all on my naval
Those are her lips on top of my label
I knew another freak, her name was Candy
Real big lips and they came in handy
I smooth got worked and it was so dandy
I hooked the brood up with my homeboy Randy
He did me a favor in return
Gave me a lizard, said her name was Laverne
Baby got tossed and I got it on
I grabbed the mic and started to sing my song
My young homeboy heard me rap
And said he had way more freaks than that
So I told him like this: they might be freakin'
But, boy, you never had that T-P-Treatment...

But now it's time to make sure you suck this dick
Wavin' your hands all up in the air
Better recognize when you see a real player
All about the game, if you aint about that
Aint nobody trying to get a thing at your cat
But some money, now whatchu gonna do for me?
Cuz i get done first usually
If you can't make it happen then we got problems
Speak into the mic girl we can solve 'em
Open up wide it's time to get loud
While i put this thing inside
(Chorus)
So lick it now
Lick it good
Suck this dick just like you should
Right now lick it good

First you gotta take your tounge
Stick it out, up & down let it run
All around my dick & balls
Let the spit drip from your jaws
Get hype wit it it's yo' chance
Squeeze my dick let it slide in your hand
Don't stop 'til you make me cum
After me give my homeboy sum
Bustin' nuts all in yo' face

Too $hort why you say those nasty words?
Too $hort why you say those nasty rhymes?
How come you be dissin all us girls?
Too $hort why you say those nasty words?
It's like this bitch
Verse 1:
See I hit the studio ten years ago,
Screamin out cuss words like ""fuck you ho""
Comin from East Oakland went nationwide,
I'm on my tenth album bitch and I still aint died
Wouldn't change for nuthin, gettin paid to kick it,
You could rap your whole life and wouldn't make a mealticket
Nigga don't stop rappin let the hoes keep hoin',
As long as I'm alive I'ma keep on rollin
Can't do nuthin for a bitch while she bleed,
You can put that on a fat bag of weed
And get high, nigga fuck these hoes,
I'll be singin nasty rhymes even when I'm old
Cause I don't stop rappin, bank keep stackin,
Wherever theres hoes best believe I'm mackin
All you emcees tryin to take my place,
Yellin ""Beyotch!!"" just to hear the people say
Hook
Verse 2:
I talk bad about a bitch, it aint that hard,
Never got the big head still the same old Todd
In every household niggas know my name,
Hoes love the way I kick that game
>From nineteen-eighty to ninety-six,
I'm still makin hits, hoes ridin the dick
My crew is thick, and we dangerous,
You lick dick bitch, you wanna hang with us?
You better never talk down on a player,
I'm $horty the pimp, I got hoes everywhere
I get my cash quick you lil' fast bitch,
I take you to my house and get my ass licked
You say hey Too $hort why you rap so nasty,
I look you in the face and say bitch don't ask me
Nuthin, they'll never take my place,
I'm yellin ""Beyotch!!"" just to hear the people say
*Female speaking indeterminately*
Don't get me wrong bitch
Verse 3:
See I got a gang of homies that I put on deck,
I make the shit that you bump when you in the projects
You can check my file and won't find a flaw,
You can ask these bitches am I really raw
Like Captain Fowl, I cuss you out while I spit in your mouth,
So bitch don't ask me how
Too $hort fucked it up came back again ho,
Smokin them big fat sacks of indo
I make a new album every year,
My speakers so loud I can barely hear
I got a bad bitch, with some big ol' breasts,
I like to play with them titties, lay my dick on her chest
And start strokin, thats how it should be,
I'm bustin' nuts everywhere but in her pussy
And if sometimes things don't go my way,
I say ""Beyotch!!"" just to hear the people say

And niggaz like me, never stop hustlin'
Put yo' mind to it, makin' money ain't nothin'
I flip the script, came with this nation-wide shit
All I get is love, so thats all you gonna get
Out here, niggaz come from everywhere
Trynna relocate, trynna become playaz
Tryin' to survive the game you know it ain't easy
That's why they roll with the homeboy sheezy
I got about a quarter-million hardcore troops
We got niggaz in yo' town too
So if it ain't you I hope you gots no problem
'Cause we might have ta solve 'em
From city to city, we got your back
Ain't nothin but pimps and G'z, we ride like that
Keepin' the top drop, maintainin' that bump in yo' trunk
Affiliated with us so you know it's gon' bump
We nation riders, we lead the resident
Verbal assasinators, and dog is the president
First round draft picks from all over the world
Get ready to lock and load, and let the drama unfold
Niggaz always tryin' ta slip me demos
Backstage chillin, gettin' in the limo
But i dun' click up with these nation wide niggaz
You ain't already bumpin' and you can't ride wid us
Natural born killaz, boys in the hood can ya fil' us?
We make the noise sound good, This ain't a game
We ain't trippin' dummy, we nation wide man, we just gettin' money
Basin' A-T-L, we got tapes for sale
And if you real G'z, we got CD's
House hip hop, booty shake, west coast
We the kinda niggaz make ya loose your best hoe
Where she at? They got her on the tour bus, way in the back
Fuck ya to a (???), We nation riders, stand beside us
We big niggaz and you don't wanna fight us
We nation riders, to the galaxy and beyond
We makin music fo' yo' ass, from dusk to dawn
Call up me the for realist so umm if you were real niggaz

Record all your raps and beats at the studio
Cause if you ain't really got a cool flow
Try ta get on stage and can't do a show
I'mma be laughin at ya talkin' bout 'there you go'
But if ya rap tight you still might not be right
If we get into some shit and you scared to fight
Some sucker talkin' bout what you wanna do?
From the head, from the hips, ain't no punks in my crew
We used to free-style, at M-C Breeze' house
Same niggaz on the mic that make ya bleed now
What? Motherfucker can you hear this shit?
He only got one fear, don't be near his bitch
He never be rich, you ain't ready for the show biz
You need to marry that girl and have four kids
Theres no way you can hang with us
Cause niggaz like us are too dangerous
We nation riders, we've been blessed with this game
We practice what we preach when it comes to breakin' hoez, man

You see you never talk down on a player
I spray a to break to your knees
You best to say a prayer
Cause funk been a part of my life ever since the starting gate
Remember me and my nigga $hort Dog way back in '88
Broke them bitches down with some sexual healing
And man the town ain't been the same and dont fight the feeling
But now you new boy
Started off in this game on a accident
Copied another nigga's style
Punk don't let this rap shit get you broke off
Cause see it's potent like that ain't right
Find a maiden name for yourself but don't believe the hype
Fool who you think I was the dope of your producer
If it wasn't for them dogs and them hogs you wouldn't have a future
Now let me add that I could never be scarier
Rappin' fo' wanna raise off in that Bay Area
Stickin' to dat ass like a hot bowl of grits
Hits on top of hits who you think started this shit
Chorus:
Never talk down on a playa
Unless you ready to be straight layed where there's a hater
Save a bitch in a minute for a nut
Its the funk when this dog got you fiendin' on this funk, Nigga (X2)
(Short Dog)
It's going down right now
California mackin at its best
Somethin' for my niggas on the grind from the west
Cali is my home but its just like yours
Niggas love to get money while dey fuck dey whores
Hit all the parties and do the same old shit
Bitches gettin' broke cuz the game don't quit
I had a flash back it was the Oakland Raiders at the Colliseum we ain't
nuttin' but playas
Diamonds glistenin' hoes whistlin'
Bitches know my name cuz its a natural thing
I had to bend da corna
Really didnt bone her
Punk yooz a gona

Stick up mission triple beam in da kitchen
Never shot nobody but I'm damn sho' itchin' to blast you
Cuz in your dream you shot me then you woke up and found out you can't stop me
Chorus (X2)
Rappin 4':
If buckin' 'em up fuckin' da mic be a crime
Best believe da police got a APB out on mine
Because I gots mo' disguises than that fool inspecta gadget
I'm not a witch but crystal ball let me have it, Ahh
I seen playa hatin' way back from da gate
Now everybody wanna be a P-L-A-Y-A
While life to you self play da role wasn't a simp
Knowin' damn well your girl brought Shorty da pimp
Becuz they smile in ya face
And all da while dem motha fuckas wanna take ya place
Short Dog:
That's right funky from da old school
Been doin' shows been comin' tight in studios
Songs on da radio interviews and laughs
Up at da mall signin' autographs
And ain't nuttin' gonna change in '96
Cuz this pimp gotta mack all the finest bitches
And get paid from da game so they never talk down on a playas name

Niggas always talkin bout 'I love you'
But ain't no love, bitch
[ VERSE 1 ]
Now it's a shame, I can't be saved by John the Pope
I gotta be a pimp or sellin dope
Cause in this town, it's goin on
And brothers doin that can't live too long
So what's my option, do it or not
Break a hoe, sell a ki, just don't get caught
Cause if I do, I'm goin to jail
On a one-way ticket to a prison cell
So why commit the crime? Don't ask me
Went to school everyday, and I still can't read
I count money like a champ, now ask me
Why everyday does the task force jack me
The story's been told one million times
About a boy growin up to a life of crime
I heard it before, you heard it too
But now, homeboy, it's just me and you
You see, people try to call us filthy trash
Even though we live better and make mo' cash
Than they do, I'm not a no-good thug
Standin on the corner sellin drugs
And just remember, this ain't multiple choice
Without a college degree you only got your voice
You gotta talk for yours, or get nothin at all
This ain't the NBA, I ain't havin a ball
Every day is a trip, but I ain't trippin
Watch my back and don't start slippin
Money won't talk, but it looks right back
Everytime I dip into my stack
I'm buyin cars, jewelries, and mobile phones
Things I couldn't get with a high school diploma
It's alright, cause I just help myself
You should know, cause I can't do nothin else
And you better watch out for the day
When you lock me up and throw that key away
Cause I'll be back on parole
Ain't changed nothing, cause I'm ready to roll
I go to school now, but just to front
Still servin dopefiends what they want
Count 5 to 10, 10 to 20
And I just keep on makin money
I hope you don't think my story's amazin
I tell it to a kid in the ghetto, it won't faze him
So many blackmen die for drugs
I think back on the way life was
Before rock cocaine started runnin thangs
And drive-by shootings was a normal thang
Before brothers bought Benzes, used to drive Mustangs
12 years later, and I'm still in the game
All my life all I wanted was a few hoes
If I was pimpin or slingin at the liquor sto'
Ain't nothin but street life, fuck that school
All the squares up there ain't even cool
Plus my partners at the house sell coke all day
Hit the mall like players, spendin fat-ass bank
Junior high wasn't shit but a place to fight
Muthafuckas wasn't learnin how to read and write
I'm just walkin down the street all alone
High as hell, my mind is gone
I'm thinkin bout some brand-new shit and I'm broke
I know I be a fiend if I smoke that coke
But if I go back to school and get educated
Be a old-ass man before I graduated
So what should I do, I can't even cope
I guess I'll get a sack and start slingin dope
I went to my homie, said, ""Give me the sack""
He disappeared quick, and he came right back
He said, ""You owe me a g, I give you a week
You fuck up my money, don't cop no plead
Cause in the Oak ain't no love, $hort""
I knew right then I couldn't sell that coke
When I was young, it was hard to tell
If I grow up and be rich as hell
See, I was cool I knew all the shit
Big bank on my finger tips
But I never had a big bank, not back then
I kicked back and watched all my friends
Make big money, right in my face
And if you ever crossed them, they be on your case
You go under, six feet underground
You gets no love from the Oaktown
[ VERSE 2 ]
I drive my top everyday like a movie star
Drive around all night in old towed up cars
And if you stop me, ain't no tellin what you find in my trunk
Gotta live like this, cause I ain't no punk
So break down the dank and roll up that shit
Light the muthafucka, take a fat-ass hit
My fingers all sticky from the residue
Don't fuck with me, I won't fuck with you
Cause life is only give and take
In the town where the strong control the fake
The wild wild west, that's the place
Suckers take a bite, and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
Mack these hoes every chance I get
Like a drop SL, three times black
I'm a pimp, a player and I been known to mack
I'm a muthafucka, I broke your heart
She gave it all to me, and I tore it apart
Talked about love right to the end
But I broke your heart and, bitch, I do it again
So young and tender, also fine
Tryin to get Short Dog all the time
I take what I want, you can keep the rest
You gets no love from East Oakland, bitch
That's the place I call home
Where the Oakland City players roam
Game don't stop, listen to me
Everybody fuckin with the O.P.D.
Slingin cocaine, knockin it off
Killed some nigga, and he never got caught
High-speed chases everyday
Can't make no money no other way
A bitch yelled ""raid!"", that ain't true
Cause you laid down, and she fucked you
Two days ago I didn't know she existed
But now baby is just one of my bitches
I don't care what you say
Cause I catch bitches and straight get pay
You don't care what I'm sayin
Punk-ass square ain't got no game
Hoes love me, cause I'm a player
They think maybe I just might fuck em later
I keep mackin though, I don't work for free
To be a true hoe you gotta pay me
I spend endless days and endless nights
Plottin this shit to keep my money right
I build stages in my mind, and it's all an act
All I'm tryin to do is keep my pockets fat
With this pimp game, and these funky beats
Now here's a little story from the Oakland streets
You see, Tania had a boyfriend, his name was Jack
Always had the bitches on their backs
Jack told Tania, ""I love you so""
But Jack's a mack, he's got several hoes
One day she beeped him to say what's up
He didn't call back, cause she was only out to fuck
She beeped Mike, cause she got mad
She knew about the bitches her boyfriend had
Mike called back, and he was on his way
He just got the pussy yesterday
You see, Mike ain't trippin on his girlfriend
Fine little bitch, I think her name is Lynn
Mike paid the bills always in cash
And if she ever got raw, he just beat that ass
It goes on y'all, so don't even trip
You gets no love from East Oakland, bitch
Got sprung, even though it's not legal
A young black man livin like rich people
I got this game from a hard-ass place
It's on the map, right there in your face
I see my people, all filled with joy
Next day they're killin homeboys
Can't say shit if you sho' can't shoot
Cause muthafuckas will smoke them boots
You gets no love from Oakland, bitch
You better try to make me rich

Too $hort, baby,'s gonna spit that rhyme
At you, cause I'm jammin, so check me

Cause I'm the most rappin, most rhymin
Rollin in a drop-top straight high-sidin
On you, boy, I'm poppin the most
I come from Oakland, don't play me close
Cause I'm a player, love to play this game
I get funky out here, pumpin the name
Too $hort, the one and only, I just rock it
Fat bankrolls in my pocket
Call me 'the dirty rapper', I'll say, ""Sure""
But I'm a young black entrepreneur
I'm an MC, right? I own a company too
Programmed the drums and made the groove
So when you look in my face you see a wealthy man

I came here to rap
You got a choice to make about me
Can I get busy, are my raps too weak?
Boy, you're too grown, don't say I'm borin
Just because you know I come from Californ-
ia where many rappers get no respect
I'm at home in a tape deck
I get played and played until it's all played out
Sucker MC's come to my house
They want a contract, get signed up
But like toys they need a good wind-up
Then the other suckers, sayin no names
Rap on the mic and use New York slang
Even though we don't talk like that out here
The point I'm tryina make comes out so clear
You want paper or plastic, Visa or cash?
You wanna burn rubber, gonna step on the gas
Now nip, dip, roll the strip
Gonna take your mind on a serious tip
Like always I made the beat funky
I keep your head bouncin like a dopefiend junkie
I got to say it before I break
I never rap fake
Cause I'm

It's time to jump back in the mix and get
On it, now is the time
Too $hort, baby,'s gonna spit that rhyme
I sell records everyday
And still I get no radio play
I got homies, they love my beat
So you hear me all over the streets
A tape rhymes with bass, I make it deep
The kinda tape you'll always keep
So if you lose it, you're not my mama's son
It ain't free, go and buy another one
Like a costume party on Halloween
MC's pop up on the scene
So you made a record, I saw your poster
I'm still harder than you, boy, look closer
Won't say who's best, I just tell you the truth
You're not makin money, so it couldn't be you
So if that leaves me, Too $hort, baby
I keep it in tune like do-re-mi
With a strict rap tempo, bassline simple
Take that, it's a Too $hort rap
It's on you, boy, I'm poppin the most

Don't look now, but I'm shinin bright
I know you wanna hear my triple x
Foul language, girls and sex
Well, I'm gonna tell you bout livin the life
Stayin in school and not smokin the pipe
It's hard to be a rich man, don't you know?
When you drop out of school and start smokin dope
It goes d-u-m-b
You're lookin for some d?
Then start tweakin, it's goin on
You don't like it? Well, play another song
I got rhymes, you wanna hear?
I sing em every day of the year
You try to get it, you think you got it
I hope you like it, cause you sure can't stop it

Takin' turns, while they suck on each others clits
Want a nigga with some game to nut on her upper lip
Massagin' her tongue, while I tickle her tonsils
It's no doubt though, I get big in your mouth hoe
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're suckin' my dick
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)
Nothin' in the world make a nigga feel better
Than when you're lickin' my balls
(Lick it right there, suck it real good
lick it right there, suck it real good)

$hort Dog's on the microphone...
Straight from the East Side...
I'm a player, bitch, Oakland style
They call me playboy $hort, I know it's been a while
Since dangerous crew took the time to say hello
Mothafuckas makin' money in the ghetto
It's just another day and it's way too real
All my bitches cut, so what? That's how I feel
It's all good so just make me rich
And get in where you fit in, bitch
Well, I get high cause that's what I do
What about you? Tell me is it true?
I heard you was thru, your ass went broke
Jewerly got pawned and your cars got sold
But on the long run you got nothin' to prove
Life to me is like a funk in the groove
You gotta get right in where you belong
Find a right mission and ride the song
Ride it...Oakland style...Bitch!

We ain't doin no freestyles
Don't even know how to do that shit
*chuckling*
Yeah whatevah
Check it out man, check this one out
I been rappin for half my life
I'm twenty-eight now sayin pass the mic
If you eighteen or nineteen speak up fool
I was born on the mic before you went to school
Talkin bout pimp shit, you know whassup
I wonder if you mom'll let you play that stuff
Now you're flowin like your name is water
But I'm ten years older and my game is harder
I'm not tryin to say you're out there dissin
I'm just tryin to say lil nigga listen
Before you grab the mic and act wild
Bitin on the next nigga's mackin style
And it's all from head, passin round the mic
Never even care who you sounded like
Sound like Snoop Dogg, then you switched to Treach
Bit the Pharcyde then A Tribe Called Quest
And you gots no respect for me, is that right?
Well jump your ass on the train witcha backpack tight
and keep rappin, I'm floatin past all the stops
In a clean ass Benz I have all the props
Fuck credit from a rapper can you match my Visa
I heard your girlfriend was a real dick pleaser
And a Too $hort fan, faithfully
When I came to your town she couldn't wait to see me
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Let me tell you somethin bout a nigga named Short
Rappers always talk about the way I can't flow
But let me hit the mall with the same MC's
I be signin autographs, spend a gang of G's
While you walkin round broke, nobody knows ya
Lookin like you smoked a whole sack of doja
Outside in the parking lot in front of the cars
Standin in a circle with some wannabe stars
Freestylin, but you ain't original
You just shootin everything and you pimpin hoes
And to think you could hang with me
I never would spit this game for free
I'm the T-double-O, S-H, O-R-T
I rock all stages and any parties
Any my style is gettin bank
Gettin head, gettin hella dank
I drop my top when it's hot and sunny
So how you talk shit when you ain't havin no money
I set trends in the rap game bitch
And gives a fuck when other rappers talk shit
I know you motherfuckers, heard me rap
So hard, I put your momma in my dirty rap
No shit, the old bitch sucked a damn good dick
Put them legs up high she couldn't handle it
I'm not a no good punk, I coulda macked your mother
But Life is Too $hort, so I kept it undercover
Now you're all grown up, with your partners rappin
But old Short Dawg'll your ass what happened
To a fake MC, who tried to get with me
I ended his career, instantly
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Now let's compare the lifestyles, of me and you
You're phony and I'm all about bein true
You drive a bucket, that you bought for a G
I ride around snuffin them fo'-eighteens
In the back of a motherfuckin big ass truck
Jump two rows back and get my dick sucked
Benzos, Lexus, Rolex and Caddy
Fine lil bitches havin sex with Daddy
I ain't givin no bitch, no kind of slack
You got one girl then treat the hoe like a mack
What's yours is hers, she don't trip
Sucker ass nigga need to check that bitch
But you're so weak, and it shows in your rap
I'm out here, gettin hoes livin fat
While you at home, gettin sweated by your mamma
I bought my mother a house in Atlanta
And you can't stand it, so whaddayou say
Too $hort can't rap, no fuckin way
But here I am, workin in the studio
And your album ain't out because you're movin slow
By the time you make one I'll be on ten
Hit the studio nigga, and do it again
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Now ask New York, can Too $hort flow
Ask Detroit, they'll let them niggaz know
Then ask Philly, can I rap
South side of Chicago, who's the mack?
I never ever tripped on the shit that you spit about me
Everytime I perform, I make a lot of G's
Cause I'm paid for this motherfuckin rap shit
Eatin good like a motherfuckin fat bitch
Every single day at the house what's wrong wichu
Eatin fast food if you only knew
I understand though, cause I been there befo'
Eat any damn thing and got nowhere to go
Daydreams, about bein great
It all started back when I was sellin tapes
in eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up
Waitin still waitin just to blow on up
And when it happened, I still had to wait
I didn't get paid til eighty-eight
I made nine albums in nine years
I'm a true blue West coast pioneer
Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest
All that money we makin don't fault the West
Cause we ain't the ones who created rap
But when we made the shit, we made it fat
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
BEYOTCH!

Song:   Oakland, California
(3x)oakland,california
oakland california is the city of snakes
pimps,pussy's,players and fakes
loud mouth bitches who talk too much
dick teasin bitches who never fuck
sucka ass nigga fake as hell
a man or a bitch I really can't tell
some of you niggas need to quit
show and tell nigga you ain't shit
sayin I got this and I got that
but when it comes to you I got no rap
cause what I see is good for me
and what I don't know just let it be
bitches gamin workin extensions
her hair ain't really but two inches
bald head girls in the oakland world
short afros and jheri curls
nappy head niggas like myself
get a bald head and say go to hell
but your a snake your a worm
bald head bitch you need a perm
oakland california is the city of liers
fresh barbed wires with vouge tires
niggas tellin stories twenty minutes long
and everything in it was smooth wrong
I said why you wanna tell me I don't wanna know
all I want is stereo rock
homeboys kick it gettin keyed
sold that mark some fake weed
told that nigga here you go
a big fat sack and you know it's premo
a 20-dollar bill went to your hand
you rushed that money to the coke man
to the coke bottle was the next stop
but you broke the bottle and cant smoke rock
bass rocks bass rocks thats your daddy
you better  off smokin on a powdered cabby
have a white christmas everyday
cause coke can cabby is a too short way
thats too s-h-o-r-t
smoke more coke than Richard P

hey young tender in the 501's
I love to see when you work your tongue
suckin my dick in the back of the car
rollin down skyline boulavard
I said beeeeeeeyach

a big fat dick in the big east oakland
I seen my homey he needs to quit
holdin hands with a bitch who looks like shit

cut cocaine get a big nigga rock
crime went down murder went up
and some of these turfs are tryin to get tuff
whos the leader of the hour
anybody livin if they push power
M-16, 357

so much death in the oakland streets
your nothin but a target sellin weed
you know i'm rappin the honest truth
niggas roll up shotin guns at you
frettin your life and call you fake
till you take your drugs to another state
and sometimes man it's a pitty
cause a nigga used to roll in the oakland city
niggas who take do you know yourself
you must be the nigga with all the wealth
maybe one day you can own this town
if everybody fucked and you are down

Album:  You Nasty
Song:   Old School
[Too $hort]
Old school.. I'm from the old school
Old school.. I'm from the old school
I came in the door as the story goes
Looked around the room all I seen was hoes
It's like a pussy supermarket; let's go shoppin
Packed like sardines, clubs straight poppin
Fuck the V.I.P. section
I'm bout to hit the pharmacy, and get my head connected
Get me some protection
Walk around and see who I wanna have sex with
The usual - a nice high-yellow cutie
or maybe tonight, I might find a black beauty
with a big ol' booty, no doubt
We'll have a few drinks and then roll out
I can't do the ""Jungle Fever""
cause it's too many black hoes here that might see ya
If I peep a white broad with some ass and lips
fine as hell - I'ma have to ask the bitch some'in
cause I might end up fuckin
I don't care what you say, I don't owe you hoes nothin
I fuck tall bitches, even fuck small bitches
Too bad I can't fuck all you bitches
It don't take players like me too long
to get bitches like you to let me take you home
I got the game from Oakland, California
I'm Short Dawg, I hope your momma warned ya
bout the old school.. do the old school
I'm from the old school.. do the old school
I'm always hustlin, always workin hard
If you tryin to get the money I'ma do my part
On the weekends, we like to celebrate
Cash checks ride away can't wait
Fuck crime - I'm bustin Too $hort rhymes
Unless it's bout millions I ain't tryin to do time
It's like everyday is Saturday
So many bitches let me have my way
You can analyze it, all you want
But I was knockin bad hoes with no teeth in the front
When I had no money and drove my momma's car
I had bad-ass bitches look like superstars
It's the game, old as it may be
it makes fine-ass hoes call me baby
I look down and think, this that fuckin shit
Seein this beautiful bitch, she just suckin my dick
Too many times in a player's wife
We always have to hear what you squares feel like
Fuck that; do what you gotta do
I see you creepin through the hood buyin prostitutes
I know I'm fuckin hoes, and gettin high
You wanna criticize me but you livin a lie
with yo' suit and tie, and yo' love for hoes
You ain't shit motherfucker and Short Dawg knows
I'm from the old school.. do the old school
Do the old school.. I'm from the old school
Don't cross the game they'll take yo' life
Respect the game and you can play all night
If you snitchin, don't get caught slippin
If you blood'n or crip'n, other niggaz set-trippin
watch yo' back, it don't take a brainiac
We got a lot of homocidal maniacs in the streets
Sometimes life is terrible
Y'all say goodbye, niggaz say be careful
Back in the day they woulda killed yo' ass
for a reason, they might even keep you breathin
Fuck your whole world up, you can't get down
Broke livin on the streets and you can't skip town
But ain't no slow deaths in the triple-oh
If you fuckin up then you get to go
Somebody gon' hold you down
so you can't get up off that cold ground
Lights flashin, and you keep passin out
You know you fucked up with your bad-ass mouth
Once upon a time they woulda knocked you out
Maybe back in ninety-nine, but not in 2000
Anybody wanna do it like the old school?
Hella niggaz at the park with no shootin
Sunday afternoon, at the park
Niggaz leanin hella hard goin by in the car
Do the old school.. do the old school
I'm from the old school.. do the old school
Old school.. do the old school
I'm from the old school..
Yeah old school baby, BEOTCH!

It's goin down bitch
Motherfuckers can't be weak

None of that shit
Short dawg is in the house
Ninety-three, bitch
I always heard that you gotta be strong, if you wanna survive
Get your diploma go to college get a nine-to-five
Every year, you're makin 30 g's a pop
Workin see, and you're tied to the white man's jock
Movin out of the ghetto cause it troubles you
Makin payments on a b-m-w
I know you never would settle for the minimum snaps
Have to live in the ghetto where the blacks be at
And send your kids to a school that don't really teach
I give a fuck about a motherfuckin college degree, beeotch!
You think I wanna get cha?
Take you to the motel, and straight raw dick ya?
You must be crazy, smokin that chronic
I take you to the motel, and put my rubber on it
And hope it don't bust, so I can stay alive
Cause only the strong survive, you little shithead bitch
(vocal ""only the strong'll survive"" repeats in background 4x)
So tell me what it is, man tell me what you want
Not talkin bout the music but we likes to funk
Ain't no such thang as a oakland punk
It don't matter who you are, you'll be _in the trunk_
You come twenty-five deep, or maybe ten
If I let your ass push me, then you push me again
He was six foot four, they used to call him sir
But he was smooth gunned down by a teenage gangsta
No bigger than me, never could be hisself
Always tryin to act like someone else
There just ain't no future for us young black men
Cause we always get killed, or sent to the pen
But even, malcolm x was a ex-convict
And you can bet I won't go fo? it next time bitch!
I'm kinda strong with my bullets in the clip
That's why I never trip, cause only the strong survive
(vocal ""only the strong'll survive"" repeats in background 4x)
..
(vocal ""only the strong'll survive"" repeats in background 4x)
You say be a man, let's go toe to toe
But that was like fifteen years ago
They say only the strong, will survive
But brothers be strong, and still they die
But you gotta get around that bullshit
All the things we used to do we can't pull the shit no more
Cause ain't nobody trippin on us
You wanna fight, fuck around and get shot up
See your ass layin there bleedin, losin the fight
All behind a bitch and that shit ain't right
You could, live or die it just doesn't make a difference
Cause everybody knows about your sorry ass simpin for a hoe
I thought you knew, _life is.._
But the punk motherfucker can't handle his
So you weak bizznews ain't no surprise
Cause only the strong survive, bitch

Party time, it's party time. Without a doubt i'm coming back and I would do it again, you can take away my beat and touch
my pen. My name is short that's a fake because I rap so long other rappers hear pop I put funk in this song. Young tender on
the floor wiggle it all homeboy keeps telling her to give him a call. He's been on her since 10 and it's almost 2 walking
through the party with his dick on the roof. Tryin' to catch a little freak in the mini skirt she can dance real nasty all
the boys like her you can handle like a dog but you won't get game you'll only get dog fake number and name. She's a mother
to be and you better beleive you'll be looking at her mean next time you meet. Young tender won't care she's still fine here
you come again with your playboy line you don't stop.
[Verse 2:]
The party start jumping 5 hours ago the mix don't stop till it's way past 4. At 3 A.M. I hit the scene buck-toothed freaks
hit 3:15. Pull out with one ditch the other, I jumped in my ride and I burnt rubber. Party time, get busy. Too Short.
She's the one, love those legs danced to rockers but it seems like days. Baby so fine I keep telling myself, I want the
young tender under my love spell. she could be all mine, nothing more or less life with a smile never, ever depressed. I
give her ever lasting love around the clock. Baby doll it's you and me so just rock.
[Verse 3:]
Breakdown. All you superficial rappers will cease to exist if I come into a party hittin' raps like this. Though I make you
feel weak when you want to be strong your soft so buddy as I statin' my song. According to the scriptures in the book of
rhymes, biting on a line is considered a crime unnitelligent? yes! never fresh! RUN DMC tattooed on ya chest. I'll tell ya
one time and one time only, you might be fresh if you were'nt so phoney. The ability to rap is a gift from god if you biting
where you writing and it won't be bought. At the spur of a moment I will bust a rap simutaniously jammin with the beat in
the back. Party time! get busy. Party time, party time so get busy.
[Verse 4:]
Shake it, bake it, make it, break it, work that body girl just don't fake it. I'm the kinda brotha for a girl like you I
can see in yo eyes that you know it's true. I'm the mack and I bike from the big oak town layin track by track that vicious
sound. All you sucka emcee's hatin my face even though there's not a rapper that could take my place. You better hunt, look,
or just get took, I know what you about see, I read you like a book. Desperate dreams are on your mind with a 10 foot mic

I was at my house not doing anything
Half past ten I heard the phone ring
When I picked it up, I said ""Hello?""
The bitch spoke up and said ""What's up ho?""
I said, ""Bitch, if you're fine it's my dick""
Enough playing, who the fuck is this?
She said ""Janet"" I said ""Oh""
Met the bitch last week at my show
I told her ""Call me"" and I gave her my card
She talked dirty and my dick got hard
That night I fucked the bitch three times straight
Next night we made another date
I gave a concert and she came backstage
Fuck a bitch, I'm trying to get paid
But that puusy squeezed tighter than a vice grip
Fucked around and met this other bitch
Right out the back I told her ""Bitch let's go""
Took the bitch to my limo even though
Her friend said I'm ugly, I ain't even fresh
She told her friend they fuck the best
Rushed the bitch to the back seat
She pulled up her skirt and fucked the shit out of me
She said her name was Paula, bitch turned me out
Took my dick out the pussy, let me cum in her mouth
She kept sucking like a veteran, I couldn't handle it
The limo door opened, it was Janet
She jumped in the car, they started kissing and shit
I kicked back and let 'em have this dick
I told the driver ""Take me straight home""
Then called my partner on the car phone
I said ""I'll hook you with a bad-ass bitch""
Come to my house and don't even trip
He came over and we served the hoes
Fucked the bitches like gigalos
Paula and Janet will make you wet in your pants
But to me, they're just two more tramps
With some good ass motherfucking pussy, no shit
Short Dog's in the motherfucking house and I ain't even tripping, bitch

Every single day at the house what's wrong wichu
Eatin fast food if you only knew
I understand though, cause I been there befo'
Eat any damn thing and got nowhere to go
Daydreams, about bein great
It all started back when I was sellin tapes
in eighty-two eighty-three eighty-fo' on up
Waitin still waitin just to blow on up
And when it happened, I still had to wait
I didn't get paid til eighty-eight
I made nine albums in nine years
I'm a true blue West coast pioneer
Dr. Dre, Ice-T, and all the rest
All that money we makin don't fault the West
Cause we ain't the ones who created rap
But when the West coast laid it, we made it fat
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
And it don't stop, to the beat y'all
It goes on cause I don't stop rappin
Bitch!

Song:   Pimp Life
(Too $hort)
I chose to live this life
(Devin the Dude)
I be stickin this dick up in these hoes hoes
'til a couple of bitches bitches get caught by they niggaz
(Devin the Dude)
Niggaz trippin - and for what?
Why must he think he 'posed to change her
When she'll give the pussy up even to a, total stranger
And, I'm just one of 'em, you can't trust none of them
They'll say they love you while they wipin your cum on them
Then they'll run and tell her friends how she found another sucker
to pay a fee for pus-sy but not - me, motherfuckahHHH
I move quick with my pool stick, Slicker than Willie
Slicker than Kelly, slicker than KY Jelly
But really this dick has got me in a lot of trouble recently
I bend 'em and go in 'em and don't even have the decency
to call her, my balls have been leaked of most of their fluids
I used to put the rubber on and skeet straight through it
And it seems, that I always keep my pipe in these hoes
Keep my mic at these shows, cause that's the life that I chose
(Devin the Dude)
Pimp life!
I chose to live the - pimp life!
(Bun B)
Come take a walk up in my shoes, pay a couple of my dues
Roll my boulevard on trues, while your lady sings the blues
Got everythang to lose, not a damn thang to gain
I be tryin to cross the line, but with that I gotta bring the pain
Now I tried to compromise, see the other side of the story
But that's easier said that done, when it comes to your pride & your glory
I'm a pimp with a glide in my worries, limp pimp I'ma step when I wreck
But my armor's on at all times, cause I gots me a rep to protect
Now I mights be known for this, and maybe recognized for that
But they be high-beamin me; and I be like where my visors at?
Nowadays I'm a wiser cat, after what I been through I better be
Back then I woulda broke ya broad, nowadays I just let her be
Cause through seconds minutes hours days weeks months and years
Man I reckon that it's power fuckin freaks blunts and beers
That ain't what I'm supposed to be
(Devin) Pimp life!

(Too $hort)
Yeah I have menage-a-trois with superstars, one night stands, quickies
Booty calls, it ain't nuttin for her to just stick around here and lick me
Cause I run through broads and never get enough, maybe I'm too selfish
But I cain't help it.. can't stay witchu girl cause I can't tell if it's
official, or just another ritual
It's hard for me to find a wife, it's nothin for me to, get a hoe
I know it sounds, pitiful, sometimes I'm blessed, sometimes I'm cursed
If it's supposed to be the best then tell me, what's the worst?
I'll be a P-F-L, 'til I'm a old nigga
Cause I never spend my life with groupies, or golddiggers
I see these bitches now, shake it naked tryin to make it
If you spendin all his money take it bitch you can't fake it
When it's real, I'm cappin like the snub-nosed, they pay me
I love hoes, never go home when the club close
I do shows, ride new vogues and keep two hoes
I'm all about this money girl, that's why I chose

Too Sheezy, (whats up main?)
Playa (for life baby)
You got to go out there
and handle your buisiness (get my money)
Handle yours, playas play on (bitch)
Nigga thats pimp shit (bitches gonna pay me)
What you say? (Oh these hoes gon' pay me)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me baby)
Nigga thats pimp shit (born to mack)
Nothin but the hog in me (thats what I said)
Verse 1: Too $hort
I was born to mack and at a young age
I knew I'd be a real pimp someday
So I practiced my walk, I studied the game
I never been a sucker but I was still lame
Some things never change but my game elevated
When it comes to pimpin hoes I been truly educated
Cause Im so slick, I make hoes turn tricks
Players University, class of '86
And I'm hard on a bitch, go ask my first ho
I was 17 then and now I'm 34
I'ma still be a pimp till the day I die
On every street corner, and every high rise
I got the best women that money can buy
When I talk about the game, I never lie
Ask me why that lil girl made her momma cry
You wanna know I'll tell you why, nigga
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga thats pimp shit (get that money main)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me baby)
Nigga thats pimp shit (thats right)
Nothin but the hog in me
(get that money bitch, get that money bitch)
Verse 2: Too $hort
She got lost and turned out at a young age
I knew she'd be a real ho someday
When she was 10, she was freaky back then
She would let the lil boys rub on her pants
She liked sittin on a grown mans lap
When she was 14, she let em fuck her from the back
For some scratch, she let em hit
Pull up her skirt, and lick on her clit
Lil fine ass bitch, with some big ol' tits
Made her first pimp rich with that good shit
But at the age of 26 she's an old ho
She don't really look that good no mo'
But she could make a trick cum in a minute
Anything you want you can get it
Anything you pay for, she'll earn
Give her some money, she'll take your sperm, nigga
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga thats pimp shit (get your money girl, get that money girl)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me bitch)
Niggas thats pimp shit (pimp shit, yea, fa sho)
Nothin but the hog in me
(Oh you know pimpin is the oldest profession)
Verse 3: Too $hort
He used to give the girls his lunch money when he was young
For a kiss on the cheek, he thought it was fun
I knew he'd be a real trick one day
Lettin girls ride his bike, let 'em win when they play
He was soft, and females made him week
When you got no game, the only way to make a freak
Is to pay em, and thats what he grew up and did
He won't lie, ask him what he do for a bitch
Spend cash, just to get some ass
He tried to marry a ho, but the shit didn't last
He broke the golden rule, I hope he never tried
His own wife, own house, and he still had to die
Thats fucked up, but thats the life of a trick
Be a sucker for a bitch and she'll suck your dick
I know he loves her, I don't doubt him
She pulled out his money, said ""I love things about him""
Hook: Kokane (Too $hort)
Nigga thats pimp shit (pimp shit)
Nothin but the hog in me (nothin but the dog in me baby)
Nigga thats pimp shit (get that money girl, get ya money bitch)
It's nothin but the hog in me
Nigga thats pimp shit
Nothin but the hog in me

Hoes be nothin but slaves for me, ready to go to their graves for me
I'm lookin for a ho to knock, hit em with a Goldy lock,
Get at the ho, spit at the ho, now I got ho rollin cock
Pimpin aint easy, I went from jeans, t-shirts, and tennis shoes,
To gators and suits and zebra hats, my pimpin tools, I win or lose
My hoes be bringin me hoes, now I got more hoes than a golf course,
With ass like a soft horse, I get em with game and never with all force
With a pimp stick on a pimp throne, that lazy ho better get goin,
Ho aint workin on Daddy's scratch, she bout to feel the grill of a Cadillac
I was yours when the ho wouldn't leave me, cause an agry ho would decieve me,
But I'm ten G's ahead of that ho, you want your shit better get it and go
But I be laughin with Sir Captain cause he always handle what happen,
Fall in love with the pimpin and gettin ho money and be like fuck this rappin

Your daddy said come back baby, find your life
It was wrong before but this time it's right
It's been way too long, you've been gone from home
You wasn't ready when you left to be grown on your own
Now deep down inside you're his little girl
Gotta swallow his pride cause you're his little girl
Wouldn't be so bad, if you only stripped
But you don't do dancin just lonely tricks
Now you're hooked - ain't no love
You in this game, it's just like drugs
Your family wrote you off cause you fucked that up
You way out of town and you stuck
Now you're on your own, you've been disowned
Since you left your hometown all your friends are gone
It's girls like you that truly make us
You're lost in the world so I moved you to Vegas

Before you met me you wasn't nuttin
I fucked wit'cha and I turned you into somethin
Now fuck J-Lo, be your own woman

I'm like the big bad wolf, you better scream
Run for your life cause I want that cream
Your father told you, to stay away from me
And now you gotta call me daddy?
Now let me ask you, you think you've got it together?
You're too fine to be broke, you gotta get whatever

Look into my eyes, and say you understand me

Your father wants to know, when you comin
But you never liked home so you keep on runnin
Now I got you, you're mine for life
Bitch get your mind right, don't let the limelight
steal your soul, and make you old
Make the happy lil' girl turn bitter and cold
Now your brain is frozen, your body is numb
You're stuck in the hoe-zone, you gotta get home
You can go to Oz and won't learn shit
Click your heels three times and go turn a trick
Beotch! You better get that cash
If you don't got it when I see you I'ma whip that ass

(Pimp 2): I keep em' bro.  Wake up one morning, and, with some money
to 	  spend,  they go crazy.
(Verse 1):
I'm going to tell you a story in stereo,
About the pimping game, that you should know.
But if you don't, it's alright.
Cause I'll be spittin' this game to you all damn night.
When I was 3 years old,
Straight pimp game I was told.
My daddy sent me to pimp school.
In this man's world, you can't be no fool.
If a pimp is what you wanna be,
You're gonna have to learn pimpology.
Pimpology: a pimp's profession.
Can't be effected by the Great Depression.
So if you want to be giant sized,
Come to my school.  Get pimp-matized.
In your school, what do they teach?
English, math, and history.
Pimpin' game, you can learn.
And if you do, you will earn
A pimp diploma, just for you
For learning what you're taught when you come to school.
Lesson 1, you should know:
Never fall in love, with your ho.
Lesson 2 tells you to do only one thing:
Act cool.
Lesson 3:
Don't be a trick. If she's poor, if she's rich,
If your game is soft or hard,
It shouldn't take long to break the broad.
Lesson 4:
Keep ya ho.  It's the most important thing to know.
'Cause I pimp or die.  I'm like the Mack:
riding around Oakland in a Cadillac.
But on the other hand, if you can't pimp
And the hos keep treating you like a simp,
I don't know what to say about you boys.
You better go to the store and buy some toys.
'Cause you can't play this game.
(Pimp Talking):
Next time you hear grown folks talking, shut the fuck up y' hear?
(Verse 2):
Now you heard my story in stereo:
About the pimpin' game, that you should know.
And if you don't, it's alright,
'Cause I'll be spittin' this game to ya all damn night.
I'm Short Dog.  Ain't nothing nice.
I never rap fake when I'm on the mic.
I ride around town in a clean Benz.
Never ever frontin' on my real cool friends.
My zodiac sign is a Taurus the bull.
I drink Old English, and I do get full.
If you're wondering why I don't stop my rap,
'Cause other MC's can't rock like that.
My music flows like domino's.
I pimp these hoes that's how it goes.
Tenders on my beeper all day and night.
I'm a true blue player homeboy.  That's right.
O-A-K-L-A-N-D:
That's where I rain, top dog MC.
Too Short, baby, on the microphone.
I work more tails.  I don't take freaks home.
Man, they start trippin' when they think your rich.
Met her yesterday.  All on my tip.
It's not hard to believe.  But that's how it goes.
I'm burning rubber on these hoes like vogues.
Check out my style.  Baby don't stop.
If you can't call me Short, just call me Dog.
Black is my color.  I have no other.  Nothing else will do.
I've got a black car, black bed, black TV.
I've even got a silk black suit.
Dangerous music, and the Dangerous Crew,
Oakland, Ca, and the Playboy too.
West coast rapping al over the place.
Too Short, baby, all in your face.
I rap so hard'you can't stop me.
My last album sold a million copies.
Me and the maestro, laying the beat.
DJ scratches from my homeboy Pete.
Dangerous music is what you hear.
A new LP, every year.
You know we rolling.  Can't be faking.
We come through, and all your girls, we're taking.
You know we're rolling.  Don't do no simpin'.
Oaktown players, strictly pimpin', baby.
My name is Short.  Just what you've been looking for.
Sending young tenders on a wild goose chase.
Up in the hills, trying to find my place.
Getting lost, getting tossed, getting found and clowned.
Every time you see Short baby, you get down.
'Cause the raps I make are the raps you like.
The way Sir Too Short rocks the mic.
It's a one of a kind, rapping style.
Have the freaks in the crowd, going wild.
For when I spit my rhyme, I just don't quit.
Grab the microphone, and just make me rich.
(Pimp 1): It was $35, 000.
(Pimp 2): $35,000 cash money?
(Pimp 1): No. I get 1.  $35, 000 plus 1, right?
(Pimp 2): The one I gave you?
(Pimp 1): No, I gave you 6 alright.  I had 1.  Now $35,000 plus 6
right.
Now $35, 000 plus 1, plus 6 makes 7.
$35, 000 plus 7, right.  Motha fucka, can you buy that?

so boy straightin' up I'm still rappin'
comin' at you fresh. Do you know what happened?
I'm sayin' rhymes messin' with your mind
I didn't want your girl 'cause she really ain't fine
I took her to a motel could've been a hotel
It costs me 20 dollars but I did it so well
She had to tell your sister, your sister told you
Now the whole damn town calls me playboy too
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they don't stop
I'm lookin' at an empty page about to fill it up
I write only the truth, speak only to you
So if I tell you to say somethin' then you know what to do
I got rhymes, keep 'em comin', they never stop
I live in California, drive a drop top
Roll by the beach, look at the freaks
jump in my car, I do it every week
DJ's who know call me Mister Short
All you wanna be mothers get no child support
I'm Too Short baby gettin' rich
Get on the mic and then say... Like left to right
right to left girl stealin' your heart is like petty theft
Like 10 to 9, 3 to 2
I'll always be one up on you
Like nightfall makes the sun go down
CRAZY RACK laid the beat changed your life around
From the sea to the mountains the mountains to the sea
all you're gonna do is wanna rock this beat
It's so rough so tough when I talk this stuff
When I get on the mic I can't get enough
I'm the rapper of the season, fresh and decent
All my raps are smooth and decent
I'm that rapper known place to place
for the hardest raps with the hardest bass
You see I rap all the time, that's the point
When I walk in the place I just jam the joint
Singin' old Too Short's on the microphone
The beat's so fresh can't leave me alone
You see I rap so cool I will not shout
I keep comin' so hard I might knock you out
If you battle with Short that's the chance you take
so you better come fresh and don't be fake
All you weak MC's with your weak drum beats
tellin' all your people you can hang with me
Count 1 to 10 count 10 to 20 and I'll just keep on makin' money
Life is Too Short I don't stop
I'm hooked on money like a junkie on TOP
I got to make it every day, I won't go broke
Ask me am I rich and I'll say ""no""
I'm your homeboy Too Short back again
puttin' Oakland on the map my rap will never end
I'd like to send a special thanks to the dangerous crew
for believin' in me when they thought I was through
I got rhymes, I keep 'em comin'
I'm on the mic, I won't stop rappin' till it comes out right
and when it's BEATIN' I'll just say ""let's roll""
I make another record and buy some gold
I keep rhymin' and I do it by myself
I'm like a one man crew, you see I don't need help
I get the job done so all you fake rappers, MC's rap masters
Give it up leave that rappin' to me
Realizin' young buck you can't rock that beat
I rap on the mic and you'll believe
Nothin' ain't kickin' like the BIG OLD C
It's just one hard rapper spittin' a rap
Not 3 or 4 sucka's or a couple of saps
Like born to Mack I'll cash a check
Walkin' 'round like a fool livin' up to his rep
I'll tell you life ain't long
What you waitin' for?
Thought you wanted to be like Too Short?

Gotta be a player for life, gotta be a player for life
(That's right) Gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life
[Too $hort]
Smob to the tip, I feel no guilt
She's young and she's fine and she bout to get peeled
I know you heard why, no need to tell
You lookin at a certified P.F.L.
You wanna be like me?  I don't think you can
Your girlfriend loves you, need to be her man
She never told you how she was a Too $hort fan
She kept it to herself, you wouldn't understand
I met her at the mall when she was mad at you
She said, gimme a call and I was glad to
That night, I gave your girl a ex tab..
.. the best sex she ever had
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
I gotta be a player for life, I gotta be a player for life
[Too $hort]
It'd be nice to wake up to some little smilin faces
sayin, ""Daddy"" - instead of bein in wild faces
Smokin fatties, fo' hoes in my Caddy
Each one willin to have me
Sometimes you want my life, sometimes I want yours
I'm tryin to find a wife and you tryin to find whores
Which one of us is lookin in the devil's eyes?
I'd settle down if I could have seven wives
But that's illegal, and everywhere we go
We roll through the town takin every ho
And of course, we show no remorse
I'm doin one-twenty with your ho in the Porsche
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
'Til death do us part, with all yo' heart
It was love - right from the start
But could you do it - would you change yo' life
and get married, stop runnin game every night?
Ex-player with his wife and kids
Lookin happy; I wonder if he really is
I would hate to be committed even though I ain't wit it
Still out in the streets tryin to get it
It's hard for a man with access to one vagina
to be faithful, when she's so much finer
than his wife - she seen it comin
He fell in love with another woman
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
I keep comin back to the same thought
Fallin in love'll throw the game off
You let her get to you, you know you still care
But I was raised by them real players
I try to tell the homies fuck the party
This player lifestyle ain't for everybody
You gotta make your own choice - it's yo' life
How would it be without yo' kids, and no wife?
Wakin up with a tramp - you don't like
Nigga, you better hear what I'm sayin on the mic
You wanna be a pimp, you better go back home
Leave them tramps alone, you know you wrong
You wrong
[Chorus] - 2X

Mother fucker
Always can't be players
Players
Always can't be players
-too $hort-
Players are the realest time to go
If you don't understand I'll let you know
Players are the people who just can't stand
Having one woman and just one man
Players are the ones who always see
Players are the ones that you always meet
Couldn't fall in love, even if you tried
Couldn't be devoted unless you lied
It's the players in the world to the west you play
Fresh young tenders every day
Breaking hearts every time your love is real
Players say love just ain't the deal
But the old and wise couldn't tell you why
Players just don't live happy lives
So all you fake wanna be's I hope you hear
Players always can't be players
-digital voice-
Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players

Do you wanna be a player

It's saturday night, it's time to have fun
Parties all going and players come
Sometimes in 3's sometimes in 2's
Fresh ball point pens, ready to use
It all makes sense, maybe it doesn't
Players just always use that lutten
Give it up everyday when the players play
Just don't act snoty when the players say
What's your name and number let me get my pen
Do you have any sisters too and that's to kim
Cuz I rap to kim, and that's the truth
And right now I gotta go rap for you
Baby, like players speak
Baby right there is a stone cold freak
Trying to be a player, but she don't hear
Players always can't be players
-digital voice-
Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players
Mother fucker
Do you wanna be a player
Players
Always can't be players
Players are the bored I hate to say
Nine out of ten don't know the play
Falling in, falling out, does it ever last
Players are the world, they're just too fast
Your life is at best when you lose control
Taking love from the way you know you told
You could love so much, just give you time
Your nothing but a player don't say your mine
Cause the way I love, is not your type
Trying to get everything you can for life
Too bad you don't know what I think you should
Too much of a good thing ain't so good
Your nothing but a player, whatever you feel
You can't be loved cause your not real
But tricks in the city could solve right there
Players always can't be players

It's not only the men, it's the females too
Come out the shop with the fresh hair-dews
Working that bottom like it's on top
Looking so good you just don't stop
The guys can't help but to come your way
So your giving out your number 3 times a day
Your a player, baby, the real mccoy
Last week I saw you with my homeboy
Now you wanna tell me, I'm the one
And all I wanna do is just have some fun
Cause a girl like you, I know your kind
Think you look too good cuz your so fine
You'll be 30 years old still playing games
Giving out fake numbers and more fake names
But you'll find out, it may take 2 years
Players always can't be players

Fake punk-ass bitches...
Do you know what i mean Vern?
Fuckin'em up like this, Vern...
$hort Dog's in the house, bitch!
She's a punk-ass bitch, hoe, tramp and a slut
Took her to the hotel just to fuck
Last night she licked all on my balls
Pussy got wet like Niagara-falls
Dropped my drawls and bitch said: ""Shit!""
Skinny mothafucka with a fat-ass dick
It's like a T-P-treatment, tongue so fast
From the tip of my head to the crack of my ass
She got busy so I called to the crew
You bitches know what to do
Hoes try to front like they ain't no tramps
Try to get that pussy and she say you can't
Me and my partners we got that game
Check a square-ass bitch and make her throw that thang
You wine and dine that nasty freak
Dropped her off and got a kiss on cheek
You never even know how she ran in the home
Jumped on the phone and started to burnin' me out
She kept beepin' so I made the call
Bitch on the phone jackin' off
Sounded like she was havin' fun
Playin' with her pearl tongue
I said: ""Bitch, I'm on my way!""
I givit to you, homeboy, play by play
She had on polkadots with miniskirt
Jumped in the car straight went to work
I must to bust two nuts back to back
Never seen a bitch work head like that
She had me jumpin' out of my seat
Workin' her jaws to the beat
She was a good dicksucker, I can't lie
Sucked so good I thought I'd die
Bitch blew me up and blew me down
All the way back to the Oakland-town
Baby started to singin': ""I love you!""
Tellin' me things she wanted to do
If I needed some money come to her
Everythin' I want is everythin' I'm worth
And you know what I said? I told the bitch
I said: ""Bitch, I'm rich!""
Fuck these hoes, man...
I ain't trippin'...I'm like Al...
Long-hair suckers...
I know you're fine, bitch
But you got no cash you need to get a job
But your lazy-ass try to juice me up
I ain't no punk
I put you in the rap with some serious funk
I wouldn't buy you a car, no diamonds and shit
All the time talkin' about your fake-ass gifts
George bought you a ring, John bought you a chain
Bitch, I'm buyin' you an ounce of this game
You better take it and shut the fuck up
Stop runnin' your mouth like a sucka
Cause you's a punk bitch It shows a mile away
Everythin' you do and everythin' you say
Makes you a punk bitch, no good, no doubt
All I gotta do is stick a dick in your mouth
Wanna give up the pussy, bitch, I'll pass
You're too slim, I like your mama's ass
Pops came home, came up short
found me in the backroom,  fuckin'em both
Now I'm the stepdaddy and the son in law
You call me Too $hort they call me too raw
I creep out one room into the next
Nothin' goin' on but some serious sex
Some of these hoes might think I'm played
Bald-head bitch need some dookie braids
Cause that nappy-hair don't even hit
What's cookin' in the kitchen on the back of your neck
Like you burned the rise and wanna front on me
You could never fuck with $hort, baby
I'm from the O-A-K-L-A-N-D
I slap you in the face with reality
These punk-ass hoes out here is sick
Have ya walkin round with a drippy dick
So beautiful fine young thang
To get that cock was just like a dream
But now three days later ask Kool Moe
You feel the burnin' sensation down below
You're a true blue victim of a punk-ass bitch
Thought she was a square and she gave you the shit
So for all you hoes that live like this
All the homies in the house say: ""punk-ass bitch!""

High cause I'm tokin the choke and smokin on Purple Haze and I'm coughin
Got some new Nike's on my feet, even my Caddy wear Jordans
Now bitches be on my dick when I pull up in a platinum blue 'llac
They come and spread they ass crack, let me hit it from the back
On the flo', they bend over, shake them titties and twurk them hips
With them lil' ol' thongs on, I can almost see they coochie lips
And she backin that thing up on me, so I do the damn thing and pop her
With a lil' curl that ha-hangin proper, drunk off champagne and vodka
Just cause it's us in the club they krunk, it's $hort and Twista
And I know the ladies know we love to cut, I can tell it when they whisper
They say -
[Twista - really fast]
See the ballin niggaz in the party
They came in new Escalades
And I got a single, wanna get up in the lobby
I'm with that, come freak all in my body, it's on

We about to break your back and your hip
Smoke a sack and just sip
Sit back and eat some immaculate shrimp
Stackin chips as a mack and a pimp, in the club you gon' bounce
But on the streets, my dro' goin for, six hundred a ounce
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
Show me love when you see me, don't hate
If you take my woman from me, what you gon' say?
Charge it to the game, if I lose, I lose
You never know when a hoe is wearin choosy shoes
You must be a magician cause you're nothin but a trick
Tryin to give her all your money, but whatchu gon' get?
I get 'em all, suited at the player's ball
Up against the wall, just got another number to call
Y'all see me I'm a real player, I do this nightly
You wanna fight me, cause you can't be like me
All you hatin ass suckers in the place
You better stop starin in my motherfuckin face
Too many jealous thoughts goin through yo' mind
You mad like you guilty, goin to do some time
Pay yo' pussy bill nigga if you want a date
But you just talkin shit I figure you just wanna hate
You hater!
[Chorus]
[V. White]
Now you can catch me I-80 in the diamond lane gettin head
In the rearview, make a wrong move and I gotsta have your head
I put 23's in the game on the Avalanche and give you the blues
And blow white smoke up out the sunroof while we keep it on cruise
I ride with a hog in the back and the vogue in the back and you hatin on that
It's just V. White, T. $hort, Twista boy we blazin on track
It's just that Eastside psycho-chronological mind-stopper
Keep a burner at yo' waist while we serve these haters proper
You better get up, get out, get somethin; nigga, and stop frontin
If I had no car and stayed with my momma then I'd be hatin on somethin
Nah but nope, not me, I give 'em out, above the knee
You could catch one in the torso, b-2-1-2, fuckin with me
Now you can hate me all you want to cause I ain't hard to find
I got hitters on payroll and parolees dyin to shine
That'll leave a hole in your dome like Rogaine, old school like road games
You can't stop me from shinin, I'm highly flammable like propane

Yeah we got some real players in this motherfucker
Too $hort, Twista, V. White, Lil' Jon, Eastside Boyz, Delinquents

Fell in the relapse besides I'm a trauma a nigga
Look in the eyes and when you see me I be hardcore

Sup?
Short Dogg back in the house beeyatch!
And it don't stop to the beat
Ain't no thang but a chicken wing
We gonna do it like this one mo' time
Verse 1:
Straight from Oakland, California I'm back again
Short Dogg's on the mic 'bout to mack and pimp
We got flavor at the Dangerous Crew camp
Save ya money, can't use dem food stamps
Other crews like to sample and mix
But our crew, we just play that shit
live, drums, bass, keys
Niggas don't like it, you can get bees
stuck in the back of your throat
Fuckin with a pimp named Sir Too $hort
We coulda sampled the Luke but we didn't
I'd rather treat ya like a ho and start pimpin
When will you other brothers realise?
Can't fuck with my crew better feel your eyes
cos you must be blind if you can't see
And I'ma say this shit quite frankly
I give a fuck when freestylers step up
I don't do it, tell you 'bout it on the next cut
Cos right now we gotta feel the flow
and make sure we keep it real slow
Just like the motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
We gettin funky like it's 1972
Still puffin on them zags, dressed like pimps
and axe Ohio Players once again
can we sample the funk?
Y'know we don't wanna wear it out
We just wanna lil' piece, y'knowhati'msayin?
We ain't goin loopy, we're goin freaky
We gonna funk it track for track
Dangerous Crew style
Ant Banks let me flip this one more time
Ya ready?
Verse 2:
All you brand new rappers got a new flow
You ain't samplin James Brown no mo'
Probably try to sample cameo
Parliament Funkadelic, you scandalous ho
you stole it, Ossie Brothers, Bark Kays
Barry White, Isaac Hayes
Have you heard the term 'Sample Clearance'?
Start the nigga who wrote it, would never hear it
Now we're suin your ass for sure
Got'cha spendin all ya money cos you need a lawyer
You got problems and ya need ta solve em
Ya shouldn't of sampled wouldn't of had dem problems
If you'd have played your own shit
you wouldn't be broke, you woulda made ya long grip, bitch
But that's irrelevant now, my friend
cos they done wiped you clean like Ant Banks' Benz
Sittin on some three-piece AMG's
Better find you a sample, you ain't playin these
kinda beats, so funky make your fingers pop
If you can't find a sample you ain't got
not one damn thing for a nigga to ride to
But I been gettin funky since I was in high school
Growin up in that Bootsy's rubber band
In '76, seen a mothership land
Nothin but funk all in your face
I like to slow it way down in ass and bass
cos that's how we be layin tracks
Just flip the funky rhyme and start sayin raps
Get funky with Ant Banks, PeeWee, Shorty B
Father D, Dope D, Tony T
The motherfuckin Dangerous Crew
and that's the drop from the dime, we'll change the groove
just to sample the funk
Beeyatch!
That's right, PeeWee friggin the keyboards
Tony T on the drums, Shorty B on the bass
Ant Banks on the mixing boards, Short Dogg on the vocals
Verse 3:
Right now you know the story of Too $hort baby
First started rappin in 1980
I got more game than Monopoly
Now I'm makin money there ain't nobody stoppin me
Used to be local til I signed with Jive, man
Used to like to sample now I'm rollin with live band
Now that I finally did this shit
I'm makin one more album and then I quit
and only one thing could make me say I'm not
and that's one million dollars on the spot
Upfront cash, money, no compromise
No schemes, no scandals, don't front and lie
Just pay the man in full
Thirty years old, torch the bull
Ain't givin shit up but the funk
Let these record companies know what the fuck I want
Cos they been fuckin black folks right from the start
When you sign that line tear your ass apart
For every one you get they gettin five
Niggas gettin paid but it don't seem right
I know where I came from and know where I'm at
and my last two albums don't sound real bad
I'm Too $hort baby, I ain't no punk
I'm just askin 'Can I sample the funk?'
So can we sample the funk?
Bitch!
Outro:
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
I'm talkin to George Clinton, Bootsy Collins
My nigga Suga Foot and Diamond from the Ohio Players
I'm talkin to James Brown
We know where the funk came from
Johnny 'Guitar' ????
To all y'all niggas, y'all can sample all you want
Here we go loopty-loo
cos the Dangerous Crew goin to get funky like this
Flip it!

[Too $hort - over Interlude]
Fuck that bitch!
With her sadity ass
[Kurupt]
Damn, look at her, what's your name?
How come I ain't never met you in the game?
You somebody I could have on my side
We could partner in crime, it's just you and I
The problem is that you're just a bitch
I couldn't trust you as far as you can sit and piss
Look bitch, I know you got bank
You're actin rude, and your attitude is stank bitch
But that shit won't work with me
Uncle Too $hort, or D-A-Z
See I'm bangin to Lil Jon
When this dumb pretty bitch turned my radio off
Had a nigga, so pissed off
So I laid right back and let her eat my dick off
Yeah bitch, I'm talkin to you
Stop actin high sadity bitch, chill be cool
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
You got money in your purse girl
Shake that ass, make it work girl
Tryin to shake it 'til it hurt girl
I'm fin' ta check yo' ass
Lil' bad-ass bitch came through with her clique
They all look good, I'm like who would I pick
When they walk past me, I do 'em like this
Grab that ass, let her feel on my dick
Actin fake sadity and stuck up
Sittin next to her, she holla get the fuck up
You ain't never too cute to get slapped
Shit gon' change when you get with a mack
You can't hold back when you fuck with me
Don't let me find out that you're just a tease
Don't let me find out you won't suck my balls
Bitches like that I don't fuck with y'all
I fuck with bad bitches, my girls do it all
I ain't gotta finance trips to the mall
Tell that fine-ass bitch I'm Todd Shaw
As I stick my dick in her jaw
[Chorus] + [Interlude]

Short there baby what's that axe
I never saw a girl that could finish that
I said you look so high and your hair so long
When I see you baby I'm gonna sing this song
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
I tell you about a freak that I met
Short got heat when the funk got wet
She's the one I won't forget
Got to get that funk like it ain't no sweat
Like a seven eleven on a non stop street
The first young tender was a true the freak
Cuz the funk won't let quit they don't tell me shit
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
The second gender that I had
Talk about Friday that girl was bad
But young tender and sir too short
Gotta get that funk everyday at fo
Cuz a brother like me pay to in out
Funk that jump bitch there's just no way out
Once was yours but now she's mine
But now I get that funk I sing this rhyme
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
The dirt young tender that I put
Couldn't understand that torched the but
Big time rapper that's what I am
But in that funk I'm superman
The dirt young tender she's the one
After two whole dates she had me sprung
Working that funk like I know I should
This and sour when I know that funk is good
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
The next young tender was the fourth
So much love for sir too short
The fourth young tender that I'll regret
The girl got scared when the funk got wet
Without that funk what's to play
Sleep, and eat, and work all day
Give me that funk and I might just shout
Sir too short just turned you out
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
Too s.h.o.r.t. female funk is all I see
Baby and short all night long
Give me that funk and sing that song
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
Hey young female there female funk is what I said
Funk, funk, give me some more
You get a lot of funk when your name too short
Give me that funk give me a lot
That funk won't stop give me that funk don't be
Everywhere I go they sing this song
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
I gotta get more gotta get mail
Told my hoe by the fifth young tail
Call me up on the telephone
And said sir too short I'm all alone
I said there's no need to say anymore
Getting real funky is up to too short
The two emcee is who I be
Working that funk to the video
Crawl [scratch] I gotta get that funk
Female funk
Thirty eight twenty four thrity seven
All about tennies all extra thick
Work that funk if you dare
Cuz all my young tenders got funk to spare
Watch your step you just might slip
Sewed up too short on a tender tip
Got to get that funk with that G
When it get's that high just send to me
Funk [scratch] gotta get that funk
Female funk
The next young tender down the line
Is just a fan who loves the rhymes
She saw me rolling so so hot
Recognized pain in the start
There's no time so the story goes
I rolled that freak like a two hoe
Cuz I'm a vet not a punk
So let too short just rock that funk
Funk [scratch] gotta get that funk
Female funk
Female funk seven day all two times
Smooth the ocean around the clock
Saw too short just watch that cock
Funk [scratch] gotta get that funk
Female funk

[Too $hort]
First we got the crack
Then we got the gats
Then they changed all the laws
It was a set up
Lockin all the young homies up
Gettin 'em all shot dead in the streets
Straight set up
I remember when the world went crazy
Crack cocaine, hit the streets in the 80's
Right before the crack they was smokin fat
They called it freebase and rich folks did that (that's right)
It's all good, but nobody in the hood
put powder in water and cooked it, they never would (naw)
A white boy did it, showed niggaz how to get it
The rich man's high got the ghetto addicted
It used to be expensive, fuck that ten shit
Turnin out cute little bitches that was innocent
Five years later, she to' up from the flo' up (be-itch)
Niggaz used to kiss her, now the bitch smell like throw-up
(hoe) What? I'm tellin the truth
The man had a plan that was killin the youth
You can smoke it, or sell it, if you choose you lose
It was a set up, got everybody singin the blues
They gave you the crack to start flippin your sack
You makin your money, it's sittin in stacks (yeah)
You bought you some gats, for niggaz who jack
Put a 50 in the crib, motherfucker bag that (nigga what?)
Somebody died, you're goin to war
You got a lot of straps and you want some more
You in the little leagues, AK's from the Middle East
Guns and coke, you wanna get a piece?
It was a set up, that's what the O.G.'s say
I heard Rick got his dope from the CIA
A new kind of baller out in sunny Los Angeles
Benzes, houses, young niggaz havin this
Oakland got a taste and all over the place
Detroit to Miami they was rollin case
Down to I-75, whatchu need in Atlanta
White Christmas, a bag full of dope like Santa
(Whatchu need homey whatchu need?) It was a set up
(I got whatchu need baby, I got whatever you need)
(You got the money? I got the llello)
Don't look in his eyes, use your automatic weapons
Shoot in the crowd and keep steppin (that's yo' ass)
Read about it later, wrong nigga got hit
Shot a gangster in the leg, but you killed a little kid
Now where in the fuck did the guns come from?
They used to put 'em up and say you want some?
Now you get shot, makin all that loud noise (nigga)
Have your pistol on your side like the cowboys (beotch)
Cause you can make a lot of money when you sellin dope
Sell your soul to the devil, say to hell with the Pope
At the Benz dealer (yea I want that one) spend a hundred thousand cash
You feelin like a hoe, money comin out your ass
In a way, it's not your fault
You stupid as fuck, that's why you got caught
You never get out, and I'm still amazed
You shoulda opened up a biz and bought some real estate
(I'm havin money) Niggaz strapped like the military
Know how to cook it, package it and get it there
You get paid? You coulda been a CPA
When you weigh that yay, tell the DEA
It ain't mine (it ain't mine) I don't wanna do no time
They got the new laws havin niggaz snitchin and lyin
Cause what we do y'all we gotta get our own hustle
I'm cool on the coke, I don't want no trouble (fuck that)
I got a felony (one strike) I was caught in a bust
Got probation, they can't stop us (unstoppable)
I got two gat cases and I still ain't been to jail
They caught my little homey on the hill and made him tell
He told about the murders and the whole operation (shit)
I feel like the slave, on a plantation
Now I'm stuck in here, and don't wanna stay
I wish I was a kid so I could go out and play
(They set me up man) It was a set up...

Put a hand on her car and started swangin it hard

Take it down to the ground, and pop it harder
Youve been hangin round them pimps again
She gangsta walkin like she Memphis 10
Get it girl i like the way u bounce

Find a spot on tha floor let me see it drop!

Are you in heaven, or is it real life
Cause ain't nobody ever made you feel like
you can't get enough it, you keep wantin more
Ever since you was young, you felt the need to explore
Baby girl youse a natural, you can't hide it
The way you put that strap on, and let her ride it
Gave her multiple orgasms, witcha vibrator
All five flavors tasted like Life Savors
I know you love her, everything about her
Laid in the bed, you sprinkled baby powder, on the sheets
Smilin, kissin down her spine
Climbed over, and then y'all did the 69
Cause her touch, is nothin like your man's
Soft as a baby when her butt is in yo' hands
And she does, so many different things
Make yo' body start shakin almost instantly

It's a brand new experience, you knew the day would come
Find you a girl, and get you some
If it's her first time, I bet you can't tell
Cause she got down on her knees and licked that thang well
And when you taste her, you can't replace her
Smooth like Remi X-O with no chaser
You look in the mirror, and see your own reflection
Face in her thighs, with no long erection

She's thought about these things, it's been a long while
She wants to play witchu, if you can be alone
She turned the radio on to play her favorite song
She didn't take ex pills, smoke weed or drink
Just take your clothes off, and let her kiss that thing
Don't be scared, I see you gettin down like that
On your stomach while you run your tongue around that cat
Y'all can be the Mary Jane Girls, ""All Night Long""
Play the radio with nuttin but the hall light on
It don't stop, juices flowin like a stream
With no man in between, feels like a dream

Life is too short but now it's kind of funky
I make the beats for me and my homies
Newspaper reporters and others always ask me
Why I'm X-rated and I rap so nasty
When I was a teen I did nothing else
But pick up a pen and express myself
The things I wrote were obsene and kind of dirty
But mama always said the truth couldn't hurt me
She also said that it would set me free
I guess she was R-I-G-H-T on the nail
Cause now I'm out making my mail
It all started out from a freaky tale
If that's what sells then I'm a stick with it
Short Dog ain't changing, so forget it
You can sell out if you want to, homie
But I'm a stay short but funky
Verse 2:
Don't stop, just call it verse two
It's Short Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew
Not your average everyday fake rap on the micro
I might say something that your mother don't like so
Don't play it loud if she's around to see
But you can play this cause it's rated PG
When I'm rated X I'm just having my fun
I bring a smile to each and every one
But there's a serious side in everything I say
Life is too short for you to wait 'til the next day
Just straighten up your life and you can start right here
Drop the cocaine and the bottles of beer
People always say it ain't right to preach
But take my advice, get wise and reach for the sky
So you can live like a king homie
And I'm a stay short but funky
Verse 3:
You never catch me on the mic rappin' a dance tune
I like it kind of mellow with the sound of the bass boom
The style is mine, I've been doing it for ten
You might say it's simple, but I'm making my ends
See I don't trip on a punk cause I jack him
Too $hort plus the cuss words equals platinum
What would I look like dancing on a stage
I wave my hand and do it like the old days
But some dumb fool want to take it out of hand
With 50 million dancers and a big old band
That ain't me, I'm from the old school
Play the instrumental, get the mic and I'm cool
Cause I'm an Oaktown mack and it's like that, so
It all comes out in my records and my stage show
In my category I'm the one and only
And I'm a stay short but funky
Hey yo, that's it
Baby Jesus
Dog baby from the Dangerous Crew

Oakland, California, West Coast life
You either play the game or you smoke the pipe
I became a rapper at the age 14
No gold ropes, no diamond rings
But look at me now, 10 years later
Ask any MC if I rap greater
See I'm known in Fresno, even the big O
>From San Diego to Sacramento
They'll tell you yes, wherever you go
And I bet my life won't one say no
Ain't nothing like a Too $hort fan
I ain't tripping, you can play it again
Don't fight the feeling, life is me
I rock shows in Nashville, Tennessee
It wasn't ""Hee Haw,"" so don't laugh
At the good ol' boys getting autographs
In Cinncinatti, I know you heard
I got fined for the ""Cusswords""
It's true, baby, so so unique
Might slap your man, or just thump your freak
I come to your town, I'm not under
I want your name and your telephone number
You think I'm faking, but I'll call
We only got one night to do it all
I know baby it's such a pity
Tomorrow night, we hit another city
Cold macking in the game is all we do
Me and the boys called ""The Dangerous Crew""
I used to be local til I signed with Jive
Too $hort then went nationwide
I went to Georgia with the Too $hort sound
I went down like Bobby Brown
I said a rap and they took me to jail
Pulled out my bank, and made bail
This is my story, it could not wait
It all started out in the Golden State
California, where I was born and raised
I used to play the drum in my younger days
I just hit that beat any way I can
Smooth high-stepping in the marching band
I turned in my drum and I started to rap
Now beats I make, make my bank so fat
It's Too $hort, on the mic tonight
Pennsylvania, can you see the light?
>From Chicago, to Indiana
>From Mississippi, to Alabama
Louisiana, even Texas
Females, call me sexist
But don't they love it, you know me
Freak nasty in a room trying to blow me
Like engine, engine, number 9
Homies run a train, standing in line
If that train jumps off the track
Then my brother you will catch the clap
>From Colorado, to Arizona
All the way back home to California
In Chatanooga, they know the tip
Short Dog in the house, I'm that flip
Getting clip, or playing pool
I can't help it I'm so damn cool
Call me ""Dog"" or leave me alone
I'm riding in a Caddilac Fleetwood Chrome
With Too Clean, behind the wheel
I'm riding shotgun, rapping for real
Total boss in the back, give me superside
They like to roll 'em fat cause you know we ride
To the beat y'all, and it don't stop
It goes on cause I don't stop rapping
Now you know, nothing but the Dog in me
You make love to me and I still act stingy
Oh should I pay you? You must be tripping
I didn't buy you and I sure ain't renting
I said ""I love you"" cause you gave me head
I didn't love you when we got out the bed
If I could love you, you know I would
But what you giving, ain't all that good
A little southern hospitality
You'd better try to get away from me
I love money, and I just can't fake it
I go to Magic City and the girls dance naked
I'm somewhat of a hero by the way I rap
But I'm living like an Oaktown mack
I'm in the house y'all, I'm like ?peeser? y'all
Rat heads get nothing but cheese, y'all
Or get slapped, put up your dukes
I kick you in your ass with my Nike boots
Some rappers try to be just like Too $hort
Can hang with the Dog, you'd better stay on the porch
In Minnesota, Virginia Beach
Wisconson, I got freaks
Atlanta, Little Rock
Louisville, it don't stop
Kansas City, Missouri
I rock the house in East St. Louis
Detroit, it's like Oakland
It's a black thing, and I'm a black man
To all my brothers in the U.S.A.
Too $hort baby don't even play
Woofers in the trunk, blasting the beat
I cross the bridge and hit 3rd street
Years ago, I rocked that joint
I say what's up to my homies from Hunter's Point
We go a long way back, it's always been like that
In the days that Short Dog was so young at the rap
I'm in the house!

Repeat x2
Short rap, is everything
It's what I think, it's what I sing
Cause I'm a rapper, who lets you know
When it comes to music, I will grow
Rap more raps than any mc
Your rap ain't rap cause your rap ain't me
Short rap, is what you find
The mastermind, short rap that rhyme
Too short baby, that's the name
When I rap my rap I rap that game
I tell it to you like you always knew
Short rap's not fake, it's always true
It's me, it's you, short rap is life
It's everyday and every night
And I don't just say it's this and that
It's everything, it's what short rap's
Short rap (echo)
Itz what?
Short rap(echo)
Fresh
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
S-h-o-r-t-r-a-p
Short rap is what I call this beat
Rap that rap like no one else
I'm sir too short all by myself
I make fresh raps without your help
And all I want is fame and wealth
Smooth in the game, just like that
And all you hear me say is rap
Short (echo)
Short rap, is way to hard
Every I stop, it's time to start
Cause what you find, when I say rhymes
Is a non-stop rap, right on time
I'm the kind of person you always thought
Couldn't make a record that would be bought
Sir too short, it couldn't be
Short rap, what's that, short rap is me
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
So so fresh
I like tenders, young and hot
You never hear short say baby why not?
I'm sir too short, I'm so down
Mc rapper from the oakland town
You better get up, short raps a song
It really ain't short, it's much too long
Cause I don't stop, once I start
Short rap, what's that, short rap is art
Took my rap to the neighborhood
From day one too short was good
True mc's make sucka mc's
In my time they rap like me
A brotha said short, he's good as you
Saw me on stage and learned the truth
I was born, to hit the tops
Short rap, I don't stop
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
Short rap has now affected you
Short rap won't stop until I get through
Short rap could knock,
Sucka mc's stop biting on you and start biting on me
And I won't get mad, cause I'm so bad
The rap you have is the rap I had
Now if you want, my new short rap
You can put it in your shorts and bite on that
Sucka mc, you know I'm fresh
A rap in my trash can top your best
Check it out boy, here and now
How will you rap when you don't know how
I wish I could hear you answer that
It just won't work and that's short rap
Try to make you understand
Don't make more raps, just be a fan
Short rap(echo)
Short rap, is it sad or funny
I thought you knew short rap is money
Sucka mc, you don't need help
All you need to do is something else
Cause mc rapper's are all around
And sucka mc's are like bloodhounds
Sniffing away, to find a rhyme
Just quit rapping and you won't rap mine
Short rap, I'm so hard
She got her butter on my candy bar
No time to play, just work and work
I gotta kick back, call me bizurke
Cause that's just all she made me go
Toss it up short, I know you know
Short rap, is everything
Her worst nightmare, her wettest dream
Her mind, her body, short rap is life
She's just a friend, she's not my wife
I wouldn't even let her in my car
And the babe said I'm her lucky star
I'm a fresh young bachelor, I roll caddy
86 her cause she said daddy
But that's not it, it wasn't that
Short rap is life so let me rap
I gotta stop sooner, but I'll stop later
I'm her man, I'm not a player
And I know just what she's thinking of
Sir too short, and all her love
But then she asked for my love back
And all I had was too short raps
I can't lie, I tried to try
Your fun not one, but don't asked why
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
Is everything
Short rap(echo)
Short rap(echo)
I don't stop, baby
Short rap, is everything
It's what I think, it's what I sing
Short rap, in stereo
Short is what you think you know
Your rap is fresh, but look at me
I rap more rhymes than any mc
Living so close up on the hill
Short rap won't stop, it never will(echo)

I heard short dog settled down and tied the knot

You think I fade 'em all and lied a lot
My real friends know
I always try to find me a woman
But everywhere I go
Bitches try to slide me something
Now listen up, I try to make it quick
I tell you about my greatest hits
My latest flick, was a porno
Cuz I reached that level
I fulfilled all my fantasies
I passed several.. beautiful women
Im a thrill seeker, a pro player
My speciality is ex cheerleaders
Dancers, gymnasts, and ballerinas
They all hot like some halapenos
If I released the names and pictures
Of all the bitches
Drop everything you doing
And call the missus
She was young when she met me
So don't hate her
Im an entertainer
And a master manipulator

Take a chance, sit down and have a seat
You know the saying 'dont bring your girl round me'
Did you think my greatest hits was gonna be some songs?
Nope, just some stories about a bunch of thongs
Fo sho
Shes the type that you haad to marry
You walked in the room and said Halle Berry
Thats what she looked like
So I put my thing up in her, rolled over and said good night
When I woke up in the morning, she looked the same
So I did the same thing to her, hooked her mayn
I hit her two best friends first
Thats what I did
She heard I was good in bed

From 14-41, 4'11-6 feet
Lil mama was a big freak
The 6 footer had her time with me
I got some supermodel head on miami beach
Then I fingerfucked the woman on the plane next to me
When it landed, the flight attendant had sex with me
And they ask 'is it the pimp in you?'
I hit reporters morning after interviews
Checking in, lil cutie at the front desk
All in my face, lookin like she wants this
Later on, she asks me to play her a song
Getting nasty in my room with her uniform on
I been with roommates, sisters, EVEN twins
Next door neighbours ??? and best friends
I got passed around the crew, WILLINGLY
Until this very day they all feeling me

cause you a gangster -- nuttin more nuttin less
Put my boy to the test and catch one in your chest
Since he was young, homeboy won't back down
cause real gangsters, always hold that frown
Until you lose control, then you sell your soul
to the devil motherfucker cause you're way too cold
And all the people hide and just run inside
cause you keep usin yo' gat commitin homicide
Boy I tell ya, Life Is way Too $hort
Another brother just got smoked

Get out the fast line -- stick with the homeboys
Ready made gangster get gone boy

You call them shots, when you're down with the click
Niggaz dyin everyday but that's a black thang
You either sell dope, or your gangbang
But you got the biggest heart in the click man
You did a murder, and now you're a hitman
All your homies tryin to tell you, that ain't cool
Playin shoot 'em up, like a fuckin fool

Ahhhhhh shit
Now let me warm it up
I got the gin and juice and I'm a poor ?em cup
To get smooth in the mood that I'm in
So lets start riding till this mother fucker ends
And hit the main strip, where the hoes be hanging
Spitting some game and trying to throw that thang
On any young nigger with some ends
A mobile phone and a drop top benz
Take it from me, see
Cuz I know what it's about
Kick a big fat dick in a bitches mouth
And keep riding, high siding, but don't front
Nigger serve that shit, don't be no punk
And while the nigger's keep jocking
I be scoping
All the fine ass freaks of oakland
That's where I reside, and where I always will be
The city of killers, dope dealers and still we
Chill like players, and like pimps
Mack all hoes and slap all simps
The big badass, I'm from the dangerous crew
I just hang with the gang like it's the thang to do
Now mother fuckers can't face the facts that I'm doing this
Rapping and producing and they can't even ruin this
See everybody knows the banksta
The big dick gangsta who's fucking with dank and clocking the bank
And I'm a get mine in the 9 o's
I mean the money, the fame, and the and the big thick fine hoes
I'm pulling up right beside you
Bumping this funky ass shit to ride to.
-pooh man-
Now here's some shit for you to ride to punk
Fifteeen's slamming hard in my God damn trunk
From tenth ave, to a hundred and fifth
Young players ride the foothill strip
They ride chevys, cougars, blazers, vettes
Five 60 benzos with ferrari kits
They love fine ass bitches, rolex watch
Top let down on the coke white drop
I love my high schools cuties
Muscle bound booties
Pools a hoes so you know I had to do my duties
I got to have it like a rabbit
Fuck her like a champ
I tell you nigger I'm a pro with these high school tramps
They say young minds, make good times
See I'm a player so let me give an o 9
Alicia, tina, marie, and evette
She wanna ride punk bitch you can ride my dick
Now shawnetta, shawnda, an rida too
Now here's a shot to the whole slug crew
Talk bad punk bitch but it's always pooh
Kiss my ass and spend your cash, on this shit to ride to
-goldy-
Pushing my dank coke into the key and start the engine
Hit song, joking time, smoking, donuts while I'm spinning
A tight haffa fullest engine with duels, and counts
Fuck a spare tire in my trunk, it's boom, that slams
Cuz I'm a young brotha like to burn rubber yo ? ? ? out of lanes
I pump it, while ya bump her, so ya change
Than I take a pitched out, exterior interior window
They wax me, then they buff me, niggers don't love me now I'm tipped out
Now I'm coming fresh from the detail shop
Going to the lee-male spots
Looking for the female cock
I feel the bass and woofer kick my chest like a heartbeat
Went to the curb, when I saw the ass of a dark freak
So I pulled up slamming short dogg
I said ""hey"", she said (snort)
I said damn I'm fucking warthog
So I smashed out doing 90
Covered her ass up with the smoke I left behind me
The metly stently flowed in my ears like oxygen
Too short pulling the bass, got the hoes on our jocks again
Fucking with the hooties, with booties, and big titties
That's potent, but all I is cheese for a rodent
Got a ticket doing 60 in a school crossing
Picking up my young cock for some cool tossing
Defermation of character, racially slandering
But all I'm ever givin ya is pimping and pandering
So please let me go off of some
Because I could be at home in my bed tossing her
I make like altune, quick to value human dash
Hit the freeway cuz I can't play when I got some ass
Respect a player and an o g that's what they told me
Mhisani nickname goldy
-too short-
Now I come from the mother fucking eastside
So shut the fuck up bitch and just ride
I'm short dogg, hoe you can't front me
Since my very first album I was funky
Bitches start seeing them dollar signs
Even though I wouldn't give a broke bitch one dime
It's kind of funny, they want money from a pimp
Bitch, you couldn't get 50 cents
I take a gap from your ass and then I owe you the rest
I know the game hoe, and I'm a vet
Playing broads ain't based on love
You want my money, I wanna fuck
And after we do all that, I talk about you in my next rap
Beyotch!! kiss my pimping ass
Cause all the time I didn't have this cash
Wouldn't call, wouldn't give me your number
I couldn't see ya like stevie wonder
I made a hit record
Now I got money
You wanna play $hort dogg for a dummy
But I come from the mother fucking eastside
You suck my dick so I let the fake bitch ride
Dangerous music is on the mike
And like banks always say, ""this shit is tight""
-unknown voice- ** note - below the words are probably very inaccurate.
Now thats some shit I ride
Puff daddy and k-5 will go, buuuut
I got my partner ant banks sittin on something real phat
I got my partner short, sittin on the hood of a cadillac
I got eveybody rolling
I got kool-aid, he ain't spilling and he ain't trippin
I got ol? t b with his big ?ol fat ass

You said you never fucked another girl before
And you wanted me to help you so
Bitch, I took you down to the strip club
I told you ""look around, who you wanna fuck?""
You picked thick chocolate, big booty, big tits
I told her she could have you, and this dick
She got so excited she got off work early
Jumped in the back and started lickin on my girlie
I couldn't get home fast enough
Now its time to fuck
Hook
Verse 2:
When we got to my room she started actin nervous
Sat down and said ""lets order room service""
I said ""bitch, what are ya smokin?
A big fat dick comin from East Oakland""
I stuck it in her mouth she started moanin
I said ""hang up, get off my telephone, bitch""
I put the game down immediately
I'm a vet from the town started freakin them freaks
And once they started, they couldn't stop
I fuck em for awhile then I kick back and watch
Two bitches at the same time
And neither one of these hoes is mine
I don't give a fuck I'm a player
I been doin this for years, I got bitches everywhere
You think I'm payin hoes? You got the game distorted
You a trick, mad cause you can't afford it
Hook
Verse 3:
Them bitches kissed 20 minutes straight non-stop
Strip girl on the bottom, lil momma on top
It was beautiful, you know what happened next
Spent 20 more minutes lickin each others breasts
Two titty suckin hoes, navels and toes
Bitch rolled her on her stomach, licked her asshole
I was smokin on a fat one, layin in the cut
After seein this shit, I aint wanna fuck
I wanna see how long they can keep goin
I don't know, I fell asleep on 'em
When I woke up I was gettin my dick sucked
These hoes horny as fuck, they can't get enough
I was fuckin them sluts till the sun came up
Nut in both their mouths, you ever done that stuff?
Dog baby, this shit aint really nuthin to me
You better handcuff your ho or I'll be fuckin your freak, nigga
Hook
Sing it, pimp niggas don't pay a dime
I'm fuckin 2 bitches at the same time,
Fuckin 2 bitches at the same time
Let em know pimp niggas dont pay a dime, bitch
Hit the studio and write a rhyme
These tramps aint hard to find nigga
Bitch
2 Bitches
2 of em

Still strugglin, still hustlin, tryin to get my money on
Fresh outta retirement, you know I ain't tryin to fall off,
Too $hort records, we ain't tryin to fall off
We ain't goin nowhere, I'm tryin to see everybody make money
I wanna see everybody get paid, everybody
Chorus:
Another day, another dollar spent
And I'm still out here strugglin
Caught in the game, and I'm just hustlin
Don't even trust my closest friends
Verse One:
Don't ever say you can't do it, it's not that hard
You wanna be a lawyer, you wanna be a star
You can do anything you wanna do
Forget what they say, as long as you believe in you
Keep chasing your dreams, wherever they take you
You gotta hustle, which shouldn't have to make you
Get your money on, like I always said
It's playin like a old song in your head
You say it ain't cool in the hood
I know some folks in the ghetto livin good
Now tell me how you get there, tell the next man, too
You ain't got it, give him yours, cause he got less than you
Give him game, and that's all he need
The knowledge, to plant that seed
And make it grow, get the dough
Even though I make money, I'm trying to get some more
You gotta be the best at what you do, and even though you ain't
That's just how you need to think
Don't tell me no, I already made up my mind
It's going down my way this time
I'm so deep into this
It's like I'm in some pussy, fucking my bitch
I've been going platinum, you walk by
you player-hate, don't even try
Chorus
Verse Two:
Don't ever quit, once you get started
It's on til the end, til you're dearly departed
You know you can't quit, too much time invested
You learned your lesson, no time for stressing
Looking in the mirror, trying to act hard
Walking down the street, thinking bout a car
I been there a million times
I'm like baby, Dee, I got a million rhymes
I been a famous MC since 1983
When Run-DMC was singing sucka MC's
Niggaz in the papers ride Too $hort
Rolling brand-new Vogues, smoking Newports
$hort studios, in my room making tapes
When I moved up to Oakland from L.A.
I was a square, I ain't gotta lie to you
I wasn't rapping, I was fresh outta private school
Now I'm old school, Too $hort, fuck what ya heard
There ain't no way I could memorize all these words
I been rapping for years, spitting game
Twenty years from now, you could say the same thing
If you determined, look at me
I'm getting on the car, used to roll two feet
Back in the day, selling dope fiend
Based on SunnySide, up Ninety-Sixth to Birch Street
Chorus
Verse Three:
Don't ever say it's old, I know you wanna go gold
Trying to be like me is getting old
It's been proven, there's only one Too $hort
Most Valuable Player, you know the sport
It's time to be you, cause being me comes natural to me
I hope you make it in the industry
You could work on Wall Street, or be a doctor in a hospital
As long as you're happy, I know you got a little
Stash, stack your cash
And keep hustling, cause it ain't gone last
How many times you seen a broke nigga, wanting to be a dope dealer
Make some money, and turn into a cold killer
Alot of people came up like that
But alot of y'all faking that ya hold that gat
Now your little ass is out
You finally realized, you took the wrong route
You got alot of talent, don't let it go to waste
Handcuffed on the ground, with dirt in ya face
I know the trap, circumstances make ya sell crack
Shackles and Chains, take us all back
To slavery, back when the days would be
Long and hot, with nobody paying me
These days we have opportunities
To blow up and give back to our communities

Bought it at the five and dime

Survivin the game man, it ain't easy when
you out here for uh ten years hanging with the cut-throats
back stabbers, playa haters y'know what I'm sayin?
but I'm a bitch killa always was, and always will be
If you ain't in the right state of mind don't play with me
Cause they ain't never ended slavery
You fuckin with my freedom, let's keep it real fool
Don't underestimate niggaz who'll kill you
Cause everything changed, and everybody got a strap
Don't wanna be attacked keep it on your lap
I'm smobbing in my drop, smiling like Priest
Superfly top down speeding through the streets
killas on the prowl,and jacking is how
They get paid pull out a gat and break your ass down
Nigga show no fear, but you scared as hell
And your partner riding with you is prepared to tell
but you don't know it yet, you havin hella fun
and when the shit hit the fan and you on the run
you better pray if they catch your homeboy first
Cause if they put him under pressure, he bound to burst
into a long conversation bout everything you did
No more tusslin, time to do a bid
in the brand new jail that they built for you
where the smallest little thing you get killed over
(survivin the game)
Ain't to bailin out, you mad as hell
Instead of send you to school, they keep you in jail
that cost way more, when you do time
When you creep through the hood and kill your own kind
they building county jails, and penitentiaries
They gettin ready for the motherfucking 21st century
computers taking over, money's obsolete
Now they buying all the houses in the ghetto streets
they way we live now, we can't last long
Cause everyday niggaz gettin they blast on
funerals and court dates, plea bargain for your life
you'll be out in twelve years, once a month see your wife
Now how that sound?
You killed the black man, now they got you locked down
they let you learn a trade, working years for pennies
And that shit you building, was making white man plenty
got the game fucked up,  and you'll never be rich
It's all about respect and they treat you like a bitch
(survivin the game)
I was born with the skills of a black man
to survive in the streets and keep stackin
I'm thirty years old, and far from done
I don't care what you think, I ain't forgot where I'm from
east Oakland / and that's where I learned
everything I know, and when I got my turn
I never came fake on a microphone
I always let em know that the town is home
I wasn't born in Oakland, I was born a mack
Stay true to the game, always stating the facts
Bitch you can't stop my mack attack
I know you love this shit, when I rap like that
you never would get me to change my style
I spent 20 million dollars on a brand new house
I got bills to pay, no time to be fake
Eating top rump don't fuck with steak
don't be jealous of me, cause it's well known
I could slip in a minute after hella songs
make one fake album and I'm through
I be a broke ass nigga like you
so I just try to stay focused and do my job
Turn that shit up loud and watch a bitch head bob
Cause I'm the Too S-H-O-R-T
I take a square ass bitch and turn her into a freak
(survivin the game)
Now growing old in the streets aint no easy task
Losing homeboys every time the season pass
Gettin phone calls, another soldier dead
Sittin in the car got four in the head
Rush to his mama house the shit is real
Trying to find out why a nigga got killed
I'm about to hurt somebody, give a fuck who
Cause you already know what you need to do
kill another black man that's what you figure
Just what we need, another dead nigga
got your guns you don't want none
You stupid motherfucker where they come from
from the white man, get em like fast food
With an attitude to make a nigga blast you
You little violent motherfucker don't play with me
Cause they ain't never ended slavery fuckin with my freedom
(survivin the game)

Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday

Ant B-Z what up man?
[Ant Banks]
Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it
[Mac Mall]
It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday
Chorus[1]:
Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be a lovely day

January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
Short Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Buy some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?
[Captain Save Em]
I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never
[1,2]Chorus
[Ant Banks]
Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown
[Rappin 4-tay]
None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days
[2]Chorus
[Mac Mall]
Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks
Mac Mall do it big on a Players Holiday, yeah

That's the trademark
Short Dog in the house
And it don't stop to the beat baby
Verse 1:
Now take my bitch, she won't complain about shit
Cause I taught her well, she got game for a trick
It aint hard to tell she belongs to me,
I pimped her 15 years in this industry
Now her pussy so big I don't want no mo',
But she still down wit me cuz I raised that ho
Found a bitch in East Oakland broke silly and young,
Don't let her fool ya playa, she aint really dumb
Don't be a sucka and give an old ho new life,
She got so much game ya wanna make her your wife
>From California all the way to Miami,
I pimped that bitch and now the hoes can't stand me
Cuz when I put my bitch on the streets,
Niggas rush to the store cuz they love the beats
We gettin' all the money, we cashin' all the checks,
I aint no fake pimp nigga you can take my bitch
*DJ scratching ""Now take my bitch"" *
Verse 2:
Now do ya think I get mad when you sport my bitch around town,
Never that, cause my bitch is so down
I could send her to Hawaii or out to Nevada,
It really don't matta, my pockets get fatta
Used to go to Las Vegas in the early-eighties snortin' Coke,
Tryin to turn the ladies on to $hort
It was my destiny to pimp these hoes,
(Beyotch) Whole crowd screamin loud at my shows
I've been to every last city with the Dangerous Crew,
And everywhere I went the bitch came through
Makin' money like a real good whore,
Tell 'em whos your pimp bitch, ""Too $hort""
On a ten week run back in eighty-nine,
I flipped a brand new Benz, the bitch was so fine
If you want that ho, you can have that bitch,
She won't complain about shit
*DJ scratching ""Now take my bitch"" *
Verse 3:
Now take my bitch, the kind of bitch all pimps want,
But if you slip and ya pockets get small ya get done
You got to stay up, fuck tryin to come up,
Get your mind off the pussy, always tryin to run up
Cause these bitches like mine, love to work,
Get down in the dirt, get money on the turf
Slang that ass for daddy bitch,
It's time to get the old caddy whip
One more time, new paint and interior,
New rims, new top and a new be-yotch,
Thats how you say it right,
But $hort Dog say ""Beyotch!!"" you better make me rich
And thats how it goes, gotta cover every angle,
So if ya takin my bitch aint no need to tangle
Just don't keep braggin' on that used ho,
Let em know, you got the bitch from Too $hort

And it don't stop to the beat, baby
Funky fresh on the microphone
One time for your mind, beeyatch (beeyatch)
Short dogg's in the motherfuckin house
Doin what we always do, a stack
(gettin money) gettin money (gettin money)
Chorus: too $hort, (slink capone)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(fuck a secret indictment, all I do is write shit)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(you got the wrong rappers, nigga you better tell em!!)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(tell em short, tell em!!!)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(ooooohhhhh!!!!!)
Verse one:
You broke the law, and you got caught
Got a good lawyer, case is bein fought
Life is full of choices, make em at the crossroads
If you had five, you already lost four
Straight apprehended, handcuffed and can't stand it
Don't wanna go to jail but you was caught redhanded
A felony, strike number two
Federal agents like, ""what you wanna do? ""
Make a choice, so you start to think back
Short dogg was a nigga that always rapped
Half my life ago, didn't sell no dope
I sold dope fiend music for your stereo
Sittin at the crossroads in ?84
I knew hella motherfuckers that was slangin coke
Use to tell my homeboys, front me a sack
Postin me at the dopehouse dumpin the crack
My niggas wouldn't do it, I love em for that
Cos now I still rap and get paid to gat
Since ?87, that's how the shit comes
We made two hundred thousand in six months
Sellin tapes not cakes, cheques kept comin
Fuck buyin *? boats? *, niggas makin hundreds
Legit, you think I'm stupid, bitch
I bought a studio so I can do this shit
Chorus: too $hort, (slink capone)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory

Why pressin charges when I'm depressin hard and shit)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(run tell em, tell em short, tell em)
Verse two:
I used to sell weed in high school, smoked the profit
I never sold *? company due? *, I can't knock it
Cos the inner city public school system is fucked
Go to class all day, you ain't gettin enough
So at 3:15 it's time to put in work
Buy you some dope and go hit the turf
Ain't no scholarship, no rap contract
But a nigga get paid sellin hop and crack
I got lucky, it's not a get-rich scheme
I've been sellin rap tapes since I was 15
I told the oakland police, too many times
I make a lot of money doin pimp rhymes
I never sell drugs to jeopardise my freedom
You never could make me realise I need em
I went from hundreds, to hundreds to thousands, to millions
I know what police want, I feel em
I'm always ballin right there in the hype
Instantly, dope dealer stereotype
But shit is serious, I know I never sold drugs
So why these motherfuckers tryin ta roll me up?
And smoke me, why? no one knows
The only thing I did wrong was fuck all ya hoes
I don't smoke coke blunts and sho? don't sell em
Call the fbi, somebody please tell em
Chorus: too $hort, (slink capone)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory

That's all you are)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(somebody better tell em we got receipts)
Verse three:
Rap is brand new, not long ago
Made a billion dollars last year round the globe
Now all the little kids can't let it go
To the new millenium with a brand new flow
Too $hort baby straight from the o
If you're like me, you're tryin ta make some doe
Roll to the spot and try ta break a hoe
Pimp her real hard and then take it slow
When I rap to a bitch, I'm a pro
I spit this game like never befo?
Grab the microphone and always rock the show
Then I grab me a freak, tell her ""keep it on the low""
If I take her to my house she won't say no
I burn rubber with the bitch in my fo?-fifty-fo?
California niggas drop the top and roll
Stare up at the mountains, won't see no snow
I go coast to coast smokin indo
If my bitch actin up, I fuck her friend so
Don't investigate me for sellin dope
If you see me rollin clean thru the ghetto
I'm probably on my way to the studio
Probably playin somethin loud on the stereo
Short dogg, don't forget the funk motto:
?free your mind and your ass will follow?
Chorus: too $hort, (slink capone)
Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory
(we're up y'all in this motherfuckin holdin tank for hidin snitch ass

Tell the feds we ain't runnin no coke factory

Outro: slink capone
Pop this shit, be outta state, niggas is hella fake
Moms ain't mess with the motherfuckin phone
My girl, she's fuckin up, God damn!

from the whole stroll,
to my fax machine,
I got money comin in from everywhere,
from New York,
to L.A.,
to the mutha fuckin Bay,
it's true,
I'm the man G,
I'm underground 106 can't ban me,
all on the air sayin they don't fuck wit me no mo,
I go back wit rap like K-P-O-O,
from the very first time I grabbed the mic,
niggaz smokin burner,
ready to fight,
I don't promote violence,
I'm from Oakland where the real kick it,
you might get killed nigga,
or make a mill ticket,
move down south cuz the town is wild,
now the radio jocks wanna clown my style,
I raised too many rappers you support,
ask 'em who they grew up on.... TOO $HORT,
fuck all that black ball shit it won't last,
KMEL y'all can kiss my ass.
*(Chorus)*
That's why the town got rid 'o $hort (x2)
*(Verse 2)*
It all started back when C & H,
went to T & B tryin to playa hate,
I flipped a brand new Lexus,
93,
Joda Balls called me up said ya lyin to me,
he said I heard you an Ran got the cash an split it,
if I don't get my cut,
you mutha fuckaz gonna get it,
it was thirteen G's all mine,
didn't give Teddy Gram one dime,
now listen real close cuz it might be,
hard to follow,
Chris told Ted it was fifty thousand dollaz,
shit sound petty,
an it is,
but that's how it goes when you in show biz,
niggaz fallin out,
should be makin millions,
instead of studios,
we seein lawyers in buildings,
then we stop speakin,
shit got funky,
I don't give a fuck,
mutha fucka get my money,
I ain't never been a hoe you can't pimp me,
I do all the work while you pimp me,
I tried to buy him out,
but right about then,
they let the lions out,
niggaz start eatin that shit up,
you shoulda never listened,
I'm always on this money makin mission,
sold a car an a truck in Oakland fo that Lex,
Jock loaned me five an I was rollin that bitch.
*(Chorus)* x2
Don't believe everythang you hear nigga.
*(Verse 3)*
I went to the freak-nik,
shit turned me out,
came back fo jack the rapper,
bought me a house,
that was August '93 time to dip,
I hade warrants in the town an I was hot as shit,
everytime I got stopped,
nigga went to jail,
treat me bad cuz I was hangin wit criminals,
I wanted to buy me a house in the Oakland hills,
nice lil sumpthin fo a half a mill,
that's was right around the time Chris hooked Dru Down,
the Luniz came through an them tricks got clowned,
Rappin Ron tore 'em up on the freestyle tip,
an niggaz ain't ran nobody outta shit,
then they put it on the town,
shit got real,
when you was in the fourth grade I had a record deal,
you got one hit record now you ballin,
you make one fake album you'll be fallin,
an that shit don't apply to me,
present or past,
you can meet me at the mall an get my autograph,
or you can flash back,
if you can do all that,
me Fred Benz,
an Freddy Craps,
smokin burner upstairs in hot lips house,
It's been fifteen years an I ain't played out,
they playin Too $hort steppin on a Chevy pedal,
back in the days KMEL played heavy metal.
*(chorus)* x2
*(Verse 4)*
Niggaz shootin at the studio late at night,
seen a Charokee,
started shootin at Spice,
at the E-40 picnic out in the park,
niggaz gather round fo some shit to start,
they had bullets wit my name,
but we never got to me,
see me sucka mutha fucka,
shootin at the street,
it was me,
Boo, Howard, an Jock,
a full clip,
one in the chamber an it blockin T.B.,
still tryin to be my pimp,
I could lose my life,
or give my money to him,
I'd rather die before you use me,
I tried to buy him out,
the nigga sued me.
*(Too $hort talking)*
An that's where it stands right now y'all. Fo the mutha fuckaz that
don't know, like the Notorious say, ""If you don't know, now you know.""
BIATCH!!

I'm the cold cap (echo)
I'm what you know, ask
Rapping
Beyotch, beyotch
2 times baby, one time more
Give it one more for sir too short
When I rap, I'm like this, I'm like that
They can't resist, the mc mc mc thing
That too too too too too short thing
Beyotch, I don't stop
Never ever ever will smoke that rock
Beyotch, I don't quit
I'm too short baby, got the shit
To rap on the mike, turn you out
Too short baby without a doubt
I gotta change the beat
I got a song for every cold player
Oh yeah, this here song is dedicated to any nigger who ever in
Life got his dick sucked. so if you don't know what it's like
To get your dick sucked, well then just dream.
H-e-a-d
I need a doctor just for me
To suck my dick, like a vet
To suck my dick until I sweat
I need a bitch, thick as hell
She's gotta suck dick so I can tell
All my homies, what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch
The homeboys laugh, everytime
And then I put her in my rhyme
Talk about a bitch who sucked dick
Man oh man that bitch can lick
She'll have a nigger jumping up
Making a nigger just wanna fuck
Have you heard about baby, man she's tough
You know I have and now she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved that blowjob
I'm sir too $hort, I don't stop
I love a bitch for a blow job
I just laugh, over and over
When a bitch drinks sperm like it's a soda
A nigger be aiming, whops I missed
Get back bitch, we'll never kiss
When it comes to me, game is tough
Have you heard about baby, man she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved to get my dick sucked by her
Bitches in oakland want to be under
When they suck dick like girl wonder
Niggers in oakland are sick as hell
As soon as they nut they gots to tell
All the homies, what she did
She sucked and sucked and she's a bitch
The homeboys laugh everytime
And then I put her in a rhyme
Cause when a bitch sucks me down
I kick on back and think about now
When I sing about rap, all about her
The way she will and put in work
I'm sir too short, in the chair
Bust big nuts like a big ?ol player
And sometimes baby we could fuck
But everytime you know she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I loved to get my dick sucked by that bitch
Me and homeboy roll to the hyatt
Shit went crazy when they had a riot
I got in the cutlass, went a few blocks
Saw a bitch and had to stop
Asked her if she needed a ride
The bitch just kept on walking by
So I said baby, could we just talk
I make you see, no need to walk
She never should have stopped, now that time
Cuz now baby, your in my rhyme
I remember you leaving, said I'll see you soon
I remember us going in my room
But I've never seen you, you freaky bitch
I now I tell the world just how you live
Too bad baby, we couldn't fuck
Everytime I see ya I'm a say you suck
The bitch sucked dick
Man that bitch is going to give a vicious blow job
When I drop my drawls, I'll be ready
Blow more head than blow job betty
Suck my dick, and suck it cool
And suck my homie when he come through
Just suck dick, till you see no other
I think my homie, is bringing his brother
All my homies are coming up
Kick back and cap and say she sucks
The bitch sucked dick
That bitch sucked dick (echo)
I love a bitch like that, suck a whole lotta dick
Knows, get a nigger all juiced up when they bust into the bitches mouth
I'm a tell ya
If I wanted, I could black her
But I'm not fucking no head doctor
Bitches don't know that too short tip
You might get fucked if you don't suck dick
But I'm so freash, I'm so down
I tell that bitch the other way around
Suck my dick and you'll get some
I'll fuck you baby till your cock is numb
I'll bust my nut in her mouth
Smooth get dressed and roll out
I'm sir too short, fresh fresh again
Kicking it tough just like a pimp
I could rap non stop in stereo
I talk about a bitch, I watch her blow
Cause she just can't wait to fuck
So for that one reason you know she sucks
The bitch sucked dick, so much dick
I just love that bitch for that good blowjob
I'm too s-h-o-r-t
Rap so strong to the disco beat
Talk about bitches who ever licked
Bitch don't lie, you sucked my dick
More then once, more than twice
It was hella times and it all was nice
You see me nut, when I look down
And you looked up and see me frown
Cause your one bitch I'll never fuck
Do you know why, because you suck
She's a vicious head doctor with a p.h.d.

Tell em what we do in here, Dangerous...
Get some drums from a break and then break yo ass
You want beats from the crew? we'll take yo cash
Five g's for a muthafuckin song
And if you can't pay it, keep movin on
I'm into somethin that your fake ass never can handle
With your SP-12 and your raggedy samples
Better stick with the James Brown and pay him
Cause the JD-800 ain't even playin
Unless Pee Wee hit them keys
Ant Banks on the beats, now we makin g's
Shorty B got the bass and we sellin it
Shit kinda fat like a muthafuckin elephant
Sample that shit if you want
You better try to sample this dangerous funk
Cause ain't nobody trippin on your fake-ass tape
Shoulda got some beats from my nigga Ant Banks
But Banks ain't thinkin bout no weak shit
Now you're goin out like MC Bitch
And ain't nothin worth killin like a sucker
Why you wanna make fake beats, muthafucka
Shoulda came real like the Oakland city
Beat your ass to death with a S-950
It's not a James Brown loop, it's not Parliament
But you can smell it cause it sho' got a funky scent
It's called The Dangerous Crew, make you feel stupid
Play a thousand records and you still can't loop it
Cause it's not to be found, but if you do
Nothin you could try make you sound like the crew
{Pee Wee:}
Geah man
Just another gangsta kickin tha playa pimp shit for nine-trey
When you're with the dangerous crew
Bitches wann hang with you
Think about the thang in you
She can suck a thang or two
Niggas in other gangs wanna hang with you
Learn your slang, made a few fools wanna slang, would you
Tell them bitches they sang or would you
Lie to get that thang cause they gameless
Them aimless, niggas get extinguished
But they're just muthafuckas
Got bitches duckin suckers
When we come to town, mayn
We rollin fat with dank, ain't fuckin with that brown thang
To Shorty B and $hort, we goin international
Fuck the local fashion show
Niggas can't be broke
Mhisani for the money fuck a bitch until she dizzy
And me and the bigged-Banks is gettin perkin off Aliz'Big Bob's down with the crew ready to do
Any muthafucka steppin to
F.M. Blue and Randy Austin
You're lost when
You thought that you can hang with this
Niggas, this is dangerous
{Spice 1:}
I'm committin a 187 so gimme the clip and let me - pow
I'm down with the Dangerous Crew, so nigga, whatcha wanna do

Known for killin every muthafucka dead in my raps
Nigga, so gimme the clip and let me pow one
Cause everbody dyin on this next fuckin album
Dumpin em up in ditches, kill the snitches
Sell a glock to a gee for these playa-hatin bitches
Gets my smob on, gets my mob on
And niggas be talkin the shit, but yo I'm quick to get my rob on
Cause peelin your cap will put my dick on swoll
Muthafucka you, bitch, godddam-ass hoe
{Ant Banks:}
It's the Big Badass back on that ass, so it's on, gee

Straight dangerous, we cold mack the most
(Yeah bitch) and we do that coast to coast
Now all the macks in the house, just grab your dick
And tell em funky-cock hoes to have a lick
Fuckin with the gin and juice, dick hard as a rock
Hoes block to block, so what's up with the cock?
I gotta get it goin on till I reach my peak
With a late night freak everyday of the week
Ant Banks, the hoes keep yellin my name
But I ain't trippin cause a nigga got all the game
>From the streets of Oakland, the City of Dope, and
I'm hopin that the hoes keep the pussy hole open
To a nigga like me cause the pussy is free
Never pay to play cause it's plain to see
That the big-dick gangsta's in the house
And the Dangerous Crew's gonna turn it out
So everybody out there that's talkin shit
I'ma wash my name out your mouth with my dick
Cause it's a dangerous thang, and I thought you knew
Boy, you can't fuck with the crew
{Mhisani:}
Clinch your booty cheek, shut your eyes, and grit your teeth
Goldy's bout to explode, I put your shit to cease
I'm like the wick on a stick of dynamite
Light me up when I find a mic
And watch me flow real tight while you're flowin - kinda tight
Goldy bitches comin tighter than some virgin pussy
If I ever get loose and start stinkin, please douche me
The Dangerous Crew ain't no strangers to
What these fingers do, hang his crew
A cold dead nigga changes blue
The skull and crossbones
Bitches get tossed on, niggas get flossed on
Take your mic and bury it like it's a lost bone
If you was a pussy you'd get fucked
If you was a dick you'd get circumsized
You better back the fuck up or I hurt them eyes
Fuck with Goldy you be hoein
With your shoulder above your stomach in a bow tie
Unbuttoned with your nipples showin
D to the a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s is the true test
In Oakland makin the funk, so won't you stick to what you do best
Keep a dick in your ass and keep your nine to five
And don't be runnin and rappin about you signed to Jive
And I don't give a fuck if it angers you
Fuck you woodhogs, I'm down the $hort Dog and the Dangerous Crew

Trying to survive, trying to stay alive
Chorus:
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Talking bout the ghetto)
The ghetto
The ghetto
(Funk funky ghetto)
Even though the streets are bumpy, lights burned out
Dope fiends die with a pipe in their mouths
Old school buddies not doing it right
Every day it's the same
And it's the same every night
I wouldn't shoot you bro but I'd shoot that fool
If he played me close and tried to test my cool
Every day I wonder just how I'll die
Only thing I know is how to survive
There's only one rule in the real world
And that's to take care of you, only you and yours
Keep dealing with the hard times day after day
Might deal me some dope but then crime don't pay
Black man tried to break into my house again
Thought he got off early doing time in the pen
Even though my brothers do me just like that
I get a lot of love so I'm giving it back to the...
Chorus
So just peep the game and don't call it crap
Cause to me, life is one hard rap
Even though my sister smoked crack cocaine
She was nine months pregnant, ain't nothing changed
600 million on a footbal team
And her baby dies just like a dope fiend
The story I tell is so incomplete
Five kids in the house and no food to eat
Don't look at me and don't ask me why
Mama's next door getting high
Even though she's got five mouths to feed
She's rather spend her money on a H-I-T
I always tell the truth about things like this
I wonder if the mayor overlooked that list
Instead of adding to the task force send some help
Waiting on him I'd better help myself
Housing Authority and the O.P.D.
All these guns just to handle me in the...
Chorus
Even though they put us down and call us animals
We make real big banks and buy brand new clothes
Drive fancy cars, make love to stars
Never really saying just who we are
We use alias names like TOO $HORT
Sell you stuff you might kill for
Young kids grow up and that's all they know
Didn't teach him in school now he's slangin dope
Only thing he knows is how to survive
But will he kill another brother before he dies?
In the ghetto, you keep one eye open
All day long, just hoping and hoping
You can pay your bills and not drink too much
Then the problems of life you'll be throwing up
Like me, but you don't see
Ten years from now, where will you be?
Chorus
So much game in a Too $hort rap
Blacks can't be white and whites can't be black
Why you wanna act like someone else?
All you gotta do is just be yourself
We're all the same color underneath
Short Dog's in the house you'd better listen to me
Never be ashamed of what you are
Proud to be black stand tall at heart
Even though some people give you no respect
Be intelligent, when you put em in check
Cause when you're ignorant, you get treated that way
And when they throw you in jail you got nothing to say
So if you don't listen it's not my fault
I'll be getting paid while you'll be paying the cost
Sitting in the jailhouse running your mouth
While me and my peoples try to get out

[Verse One]
What you rhyme mayne?  You always spend G's
How much cash you got that you can lend me?
Think I'll pay you back, think you flossin hard
when you ridin down the strip in yo' boss's car?
With your silver chain on and your fake diamonds
Cain't do it right but you stay tryin
You got big dreams, to hit a lick quick
And buy a brand new house, but you ain't get shit
Wouldn't even know what to do if you had bread
How to be a baller - can you pass the test?
There's more than one way to hit the top
Trunk full of dope nigga don't get stopped
Take it to the house and bag it up
Make that money and stack it up
Or spend it all in one place, what you want from me?
I can't tell you how to run yo' company
And don't start bitchin bout Too $hort
What the fuck I wanna listen to you fo'?
Look at you, you ain't all that successful
Them plates ain't made out of Cristal
You just regular, plain ol' frontin
You come from nowhere and you don't claim nuttin
Stop bein phony, actin hella hard
Girl at the mall, maxin your credit card
Answer your cell phone, now you smilin
Talk to your girl, man it's been a while
since she left to go shoppin, girl where you at?
She out havin lunch with a player mack
I'm in the background, don't trip partner
Just munchin on the lunch that your bitch bought me
She don't love you, she just used to you
Got your mom and them wonderin what she do to you
[Chorus]
I don't pay hoes, I turn 'em
I teach hoes, you learn 'em
How we get them hoes, don't concern 'em
The old fashioned way, we earn 'em
I been in the game, I did it
I'm true to the game, I'm so committed
I got a lot of hoe money, where you get it
The old fashioned way, I just spit it
[Verse Two]
I'm pimpish, I never let hoes pimp me
I let one bitch get me, and instantly
she dipped to Mexico, I'ma get you hoe
I'ma find you and check you like a physical
I'm not a doctor, but I cut a bitch open
With this game have her broken never quit hoein
A bad habit, I picked up along the way
Break a bitch, and make a new song every day
I do my own thing, I'm original
I was ""Born to Mack"" when I came in the do'
Just so you know, I got the game from the East
Lake Merritt(?) to Sobranny(?) in them East Oakland streets
Took my game on the road, became a millionaire
Tell the world get ready for a real player
And so it happened, I grabbed the mic and start rappin
Make that money keep stackin
I made a new album, fourteen times
Hoes screamin out Too $hort keep rhymin
I got rich screamin BITCH
My favorite word; I hear it on - E'RYBODY shit
And when they say it like me, I couldn't want mo'
Send a special thanks out to yo' Uncle $hort
Do yo' thang nephew, y'know I'm down witcha
Stay strapped, watch yo' back, don't let the town getcha
And when you get mad, try to use your brain
Get some street etiquette, don't abuse the game
You know us real ones, you know we never bite
When these hoes start shit you know we never fight
Cause I'd be layin on the ground feelin real silly
All I did was fuck his bitch, that nigga still killed me
And even though I know a sucker spent all his cash
Just so he could fuck and try to get some ass

These are the tales
These are the tales that I tell so well
(tune in to the history channel)
These are the tales (learn a lesson biatch)
these are the tales that I tell so well (Short Dog)
I'm thinkin' way back, it's been a long long time
In 1980 I wrote my first rhyme
I like to spit a lot of game
but back then, I was just sayin' my name
I had a record player, on my stereo
Got down on my knees with my radio
From Oakland California with some new shit
I'm Sir Too $hort I'm bout to do this
In 1981, that's where it all begun
We do it for the money we don't rap for fun
Five dolla's fo' a tape, Too $hort and Freddy B
Money in my pocket's all I ever need
It was me, Fred B, and Freddy Brack
Dipped the sermon sticks then we smoked them phat
While we rapped about the bitches and all the ho's
Can't be in the hole tryin' to ball without vogues
In '82 you was in the game
with a Falcon, Cougar or a Mustang
Me and Freddy B used to hit the turfs
with a bag of tapes puttin in work, Biatch
In '83 you hit a house party
a dolla' get you in and a dolla' fo' a drink
I'm on the turntable smokin' get-right
and at mid-night I'll be rappin' on the mic
I did the same thang, for the next two years
That's why they say my name, when I come through here
When I was 16, I want'd to be a mack
I went to Fremont High with Lil' D and Black
Young ballers in the town livin' real phat
Never had the sack but I smoked a little crack
Crushed up in the weed, we call em bass rock Caddies
Goin' on them grimmies make them ho's call me daddy
[Hook]
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
These are the tales, these are the tales that I tell so well
[Too $hort]
It's been 15 years since that shit happened
But Too $hort don't stop rappin'
In '85, I was on the right page
Ten thousand niggaz, $hort live on stage
Underground tapes was all they ever heard
but the whole crowd sang along with me word for word
And that changed everything
Went to Seventy Five Girls and hooked up with Dean
Real player-ism and that's no joke
Snort a lot of coke with ho's that like to smoke
I was makin' records but wasn't makin' money
you can take it seriously or you can think its funny
By '87, I was on my own, started Dangerous Music
and I made the song ""These are the tales, the freaky tales""
No radio or video or CD sales
Six platinums in a row Ice Cube and Cool J
Who else did that shit? $hort Dog from the Bay
These ho's try to play it safe
but I been mackin' hard since eighty-eight
And from eighty-nine to ninety-six
I was rappin' on the mic talkin' shit about a bitch
I'll retire 10 times and I'll still be here
My old records sell about a half a mil' a year
I say ""bitch get naked"" so pimpishly
spit rhymes through decades and centuries
And bitches just love my dirty mouth
when I see you again I'ma cuss you out, BIATCH!
That's my gift, now all you rappers get to say that shit
I wont sue you, but that's the trademark
I was a grown ass man when you was playin' in the park lil' nigga
[Hook]
[Too $hort]
Now I'm in Atlanta I still love the O
I gave you my bitch but you can't have my flow
I guest appeared on 47 albums
Fuck McDonalds and fuck Calvin
I get money with Erick Sermon when I'm in New York
I get respect, they call me Too $hort
I live swell in A.T.L. cause I'm a player
We fuckin' hella ho's at X House in Decatur where it's greater
You know how we ride
I got love for all niggaz from the EastSide
It was me, Ant Banks and Shorty B
All we need to do is find my nigga PeeWee
We used to be on Murdel Street makin' funky songs
if you see him tell him Short said its back on
Lets get this money, midwest down South
East coast West coast ride out, BIATCH
[Too $hort talking over Hook]
That's my gift to rap, you can have that word
Say bitch all you want, all you regular fake ass niggas
You finally get to have Too $hort's bitch, trick

Catch me headed out west, Impala drive
And when they see balkin and be talkin bout (?)
Too $hort, Eastsidaz, and ya boy Big Tig
It's on and poppin now, but we wattn't always this big
Wanted a Benz and a Lotus (what?)
Whatever feels, sprayin Raid on the roaches
I mean the whole damn scene was kinda hopless (whattchu mean?)
Came home to it, then we flipped the notice
Now we big crib livin, Rockland and non-stop
with hot women, cop drops with rims that don't stop spinnin (whoo!)
And it's just the beginnin (what?)
Cuz as long as the game strong we gon' keep winnin
Big Tigger, Too $hort, drops it so mean
That lets us go get us a team of flatscreens
Three cars, three cribs and three bikes
When I drop this hot shit, I'm gonna cop three plus three mics
[talking]
Y'all niggaz better stop playin and get yo' game tight
Too $hort, Eastsidaz, Big Tig... oh boy
Album number 13 nigga, y'all better stop chasin the cat
Chase that money, well unless you know
The cat got money (please believe it) this how we eat nigga!
Let's go, oh boy...

Heyyy! Strip down to your asshole
Whoa, more excitin than the last hoe
Just pop that pussy and shake that ass
Pop that pussy and shake that ass
[Too $hort]
You got dem heels, do that A-Town lady stomp
You ain't white bitch, must be them razor bumps
Stop shavin that cat girl
You might need to get it waxed girl
I saw enough of you the other day, you need to go the other way
Everything looks good on the hoe but her face
Turn back around girl
Before you drop it to the ground girl
I wanna see you down on all 4's, what you got on drawers for
That's daytime shit, hit the club when the mall close
And drop them panties girl
Your pussy feelin better now ain't it girl
Hear the crash from the cymbal when your ass start to tremble
Wanna ride with a pimp, blowin hash out the window
Better make my night happy
Or it's gon' be some problems like Lil' Scrappy
You know the drill!
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
Naw baby wasn't doin it right
C'mere lil' mama see what you look like
Can you get butt naked girl?
Can I see how you shake it girl?
You gotta turn a nigga on when you dancin to the song
I wanna get you all alone in the mansion in a thong
Lemme see that pussy hoe
You think you got what I'm lookin fo'?
I need a freak that'll suck me back hard when I cum
Ain't no way we goin to sleep, not befo' we see the sun
Can you make that happen girl?
I'm all night, all day with this mackin girl
I wanna see you do that dance when you swing on the pole
Put your ass in my hands, put my thang in your hole
Now shake that ass girl
But don't do it too fast girl
You know the drill!
[Chorus]
[Too $hort]
You make me feel like we fuckin and we still in the club
You probably have a trickin millionaire really in love
Let me see that pussy girl
Now let me see how you touch it girl
You act like you wanna fuck when you back it up
Make my dick get bigger than a mack truck
Let me see you bend over girl
You gotta get a little closer girl
I ain't tippin no mo' 'til you get buck booty
Wanna see you ass-naked like you're in a fuck movie
Shake that booty girl
You know you wanna give it to me girl
I said waittress where the 'gnac at, I need a big sip
Girl if you don't get naked I'm about to dip, BEOTCH
Cause time don't stop girl
Get naked and climb on top girl
You know the drill!

[woman] Short Dawg!
[Too $hort]
What's on yo' mind ho?  That nigga Too $hort
got you playin witcho' pussy fo' twenty-fo'
In the mo'nin, why I won't call you back
Got another little freak all on my lap
She's been tellin me things that I wanna hear
So I hit you on another day, another year maybe
I still wanna see you baby
I know I told a few lies, you wanna be my lady
I let you ride with a player in my new truck
Take you straight to my house, you can do me up
and back down again, get around your friends
Let 'em know, e'ry nigga from the town's a pimp
My daddy was a player, my grandpa too
Now what the fuck else am I supposed to do?
Put my finger on the pussy, rub the nipple next
Short Dawg's in the house with the triple X
I'm a hooker's dream, a hoe's delight
They prove it, with bankrolls every night
You like to kiss her, she like to drink sperm
Get you high, smokin that pink sherm
I don't have sex with her, she just give me head
Like the ex-President, I don't need a bed
Let it drip down your cheek, get all on your dress
Rinse the evidence or rub it all on your tits
I don't care - cause I'm cold as ice
I don't feel nothin for you, think you know I'm nice
That's what you heard about Todd when I'm gettin hoes
Leave a trail of broken hearts when I let 'em go
It's not my fault, cause they be all in the club
Believin what I say, bitches fallin in love
When all I really wanted was a little sex
Turn your ass out with my triple X
[Chorus: female singer]
It's Short Dawg, he came to play the game
So whatch'all wanna do?  He'll make you say his name (Short Dawg)
It's Short Dawg, he came to play the game
So whatch'all wanna do?  He'll make you say his name (Short Dawg!)
[Too $hort]
Now what you bouts to do, little prostitute
I see that sucka in ya ear but I gots to shoot
some real game your way, what I came to say
is what I did yesterday it ain't gon' change today
And if I cain't knock you I bet I get her
Cause I'm a hard workin pimp, I'm not a quitter
These hatin lames, don't even realize
Short Dawg's dirty rhymes make them fantasize
I don't dream about pussy cause I get too much
Can't believe that nasty slut didn't let you fuck
But maybe you ain't ready for the skills she got
Non-stop, hit the cot, the bitch still be hot
She's workin tonight, she'll stick to the script
My life is so tight, when hoes flip you tricks
Put a sponge on her pussy and she'll still be wet
Another bitch turned out by my triple X
It's nothin new - I've ran up in a few
Hit the party had the hardest G's cuffin them too
Cause I'm a mack, the whole world knows that
I'm in the house, you better hold your hoes back
Fuck $hort - that's what the bitches thinkin
Put my hand up her dress and her clit was stinkin
I gotta pass!  Pussy smell like ass
So I jumped in my Benz and gave it hella gas
I can't believe you nasty girls tryin to get some
Sit on my shit and give my dick the runs
Like the East coast homies they don't slip son
Too many women in the world, you bound to get one
That slick bitch, dressed her up and played the road
But all my niggaz out in Texas say the bitch is throwed
She snort coke, rollin on them triple stacks
Rated X in the back while we dip the 'llac, beotch!

The luscious bitch, she is true
But it's not nice to fool Mother Nature
The proud mother of God, like all hoes
is jealous of her own shadow
Who is this young big tawny bitch who wish to be queen for a day?
Who would sacrifice the great grandsons and daughters of her jealous mother?
By suckin their brain until their ability to think was amuptated?
By pimpin their instincts until they were fat, horny and strung out?
And her right to be kept queen of the universe
Who is this bitch?
[Too $hort]
You get, somethin for nothin when you got to get the gas
Spit the game in her ear tell her, get on the ave
It's mind manipulation, in every situation
There's a pimp and a ho, somebody roll this Dayton
downhill, takin the easy way
While the other brother say it should be this way
Which one are you? Cause I was ""Born to Mack""
Since the day of my birth, I was sworn to that
It's the P-I, M-P, that's in me
You envy, how instantly I make ten G's
And never lift a finger, makes you wanna bring a
player to the show and get your clown Jerry Springer
Blame the consumer's how I look at life
It's just another day in a hooker's life
With no tricks there's no pimpin
It's like drugs with no fiends, sex with no women

Or beat your pussy up 'til it smokes?
Young girl lookin brand new, told me what her man do

Now you got me talkin niggarish
So just color me like a nigga
Peanut bitin on my tongue while I'm spillin nigga gibberish
Nigga got a habit of babblin broken english
So make an american apple so a nigga won't be distinguished
Perceivin me to be somewhat a common nigga?
Fuck an AK-47, a millimeter
Don't need a fresh hooker on my jock shootin drag
Gettin paid ho
Go rush some cash
You went to school to still run in the street
Back in the day, you know a raw nigga like me don't play
I'm a blue B-L-A-C-K black-ass nigga
Suck my dick and make it bigger
As I walk into the party I grab my goatin ass
You see him and you love him, here you go ho hug him
Walkin around here with your lips curled, makin me sick
Actin like you got class, this here Sheba Makeba
I said naw, disagree
She was a beat the bitch, bitch I bet I'll beat yo' ass

You see my pockets stay full, yours stay empty
You say I look Kunta Kinte
Blue black ain't shit jack, I'm blacker than that
Jet black, yeah I do smoke crack
You and your bitch will get checked

I do it like the best of the greatest, not the worst
Like welfare day, can't stop the first of the month
Can't stop Short Dawg neither
Got a good hoe niggaz sure better keep her
Cause I'm on the prowl, all the time
Tryin knock every bitch so they all be mine
And I ain't never, ever gone change my ways
Drop a few lines, leave a bitch in a daze
Have her homegirls wonderin what she do
Fucked around and gave me that pussy too
I be doin this shit on a regular basis
Got bitches everywhere in all kind of places
I can pull out my little black phone book
Flip every last page take a long look
Than pull out a bitch, like a rabbit out a hat
Nigga if I want, I can have it like that
Fuck two or three bitches at the same time
Grab the microphone sing my rhyme
About them same three bitches that fucked me good
Us niggas gotta do what the fuck we should when we want to
I might pass it
So get butt naked, shake that ass bitch
I'm bout as real as the stones in my diamond rings
You can hate my guts, but I'm gone do these things, bitch
[MC Breed]
Ahhh why have a nine, when I can have a ten
Lickin up the nuts, while I'm gone holler at her friend
Bitch, ain't no time for me to teach her
Rather have an everyday hoe, that umm knows how to treat a nigga
Thinkin if she ain't lickin me up
I'm givin her to Short, cause he don't give a fuck
Do yourself a favor and quit callin my house
If you really don't want this nigga to put this dick in your mouth
Umm, have you seen my bitch?
I ain't seen her, but if i do she gets dick
That's what I'm givin her just like that
To the front and back, nothing but the bozack
The second she get lonely, feelin she can get her money
And she run to fuck her own ignorant homey
You a lost cause, yellin pause when they drop the draws
Its's entrapment, have yo nigga breakin nigga laws
But it ain't a matter of mentality, it's reality
Open your eyes, realize bitches ain't nothin but a casuality
But a factor to a nigga wanting fuckin time
She's just an everday, don't wanna catch a fuckin ?mime?
Bitch ain't lieing, so I thought you knew this
Bitch this is how I do this
[Short Dawg]
You can call eight ball in the corner when you shootin pool
But when you play the game of life, ain't no stupid rules
Gotta go for yours at all times
Cause if you don't, nigga yours will be mine
And I won't go to bed early, won't sleep too late
And I'll never take a punk ass bitch on a date
They say Too Short baby why you talk so bad?
Just a player ass nigga and that's all I rap about
Bitches, hoes and all that shit
She got my number, if she beep me I might call the bitch
And go diggin in them guts like a gardener
If she starts screamin, I'm gone fuck the hoe harder
Just havin fun with the bitch, as she sprung on my dick
Guess I'll pull it out and just cum on the bitch
And from New Year's Day to New Year's Eve
And everyday in between I will do these things, I won't stop bitch

I like to go to the club mix and mingle
Nigga plays his dick like a 12 inch single
Yeah, so what you bitches wanna do?
Step to me you gots to do my crew, first
When I rehearse I change rearrange
My mentality will bring you to reality
You on me like cologne 'til now
I feel it's time for us to bone so I
Look and pimp the background
Look, listen put the bitch on lockdown
See you hangin out with me tonight
Everythings alright, but a nigga wanna fight
Damn, that's a real player hater for ya
Fuck it, I'll be waitin for ya

I'm droppin lines like a mother fuckin pimp at this shit
I'm gettin hoes out they clothes cause i'm good at this shit
They callin me the pussy jammer cause I'm breakin hoes off
See i'm paid to be boss, I'm kickin back at no cost
Never slackin, just mackin, money stackin that's my motto
With so much game they want to play me like the lotto
Tip the bottle, now I'm drunk as a skunk
High off the dank, but I can't front
See I'm never being senile
See I'm smooth as a nail on a fingernail file
Keepin it wild, but in the meanwhile we the coolest
Sure enough this how we do this
[2Pac]
I'm fingerfuckin with my
Now they peepin how a nigga climb on the chart
Ain't fear in my heart, I represent it from the start
Deep, my momma raised me as a g from birth
Be a hustlin motherfucker 'til I sees my hearse
No doubt, I bust a shot for all my niggaz in jail
All the young black males, that got slang yell
Cause its a hard life nigga only thugs survive
Ain't no love, unless a nigga slangin drugs or high
Conversations with these bitches on my mobil
Always in control and never let these bitches know ya
And even though I'm gettin high, a thug nigga gettin by
Catchin bitches spittin lies, I'm gettin mine
All day, I puff a blunt and parlay and sometimes if we party
Gettin my dick licked twice
And death to a trick's life, we can pursue this 'til my shit's right
Went from havin fantasies, to havin hoes leave they man for me
There is no realer man than me
The city of Oaktown laced me with my first case
When them punk police tried to break me
Didn't think the shit was cute, so I got a lawsuit
And made them punk police buy my coupe
This is how we do this

I know you and B-Legit finna get in here and get down on this song right?
But yall can't be talkin bad about broads, man, you know?
Yall in here talkin bout ""suckin this"" and ""suckin that""
Aww shit, here come B pullin up in his 600 blowin big weed, yall be cool man
Verse 1: B-Legit/Too $hort
B-Legit:
I blaze blunts all day get keyed all night
Be the one to take flight if the smoke aint right
I'm tight, nicknamed Ike for the drama
It's baby and her mama, naked in a sauna
Down with the gang cuz them flows be hard
Blue mink, Short, and my St. Brenard
Super bad man all around Hoo-J
Tell me what the fuck happened to the groupies
Too $hort:
What happened to the groupies, I thought they was comin through
To do everything we want em to
Supposed to be all good when they get here
Break niggas off, bitch we real playas
Baby in the red said ""It's coo'""
She gonna give me some pussy, and some head too
I aint trippin though, these bitches takin too long
I'm bout to call some other hoes on the phone
B-Legit:
Tell em I'm a hog nigga, need a triple-X bitch down to stick
Turn tricks switched the dick
Theres hips outside and I'm fo' sho' dat
And the finest ho she know where mo' at
Gotta show that, nigga tuck my jewels
Can't be slippin with a bitch, niggas know that shit
Hit me at the room when the hoes come
It be at 301 we callin for some
Too $hort:
Where they at B-Legit where they at? (where they at)
Let these bitches know theres some real playas back
Told her meet me in room 510 on the mattress
If you do it right then I'll be back bitch
Another showdown, in yo' town
Let everybody know you my ho now
I'm feelin way too cool off the gin and juice
I'm bout to fuck my bitch and her friend too (and her friend too)
Captain Save-A-Hoe:
Damn, see man yall niggas is trippin man,
niggas this '98 yall actin like its still '88
Short cussin, and all this bullshit,
check this out--see baby and them leavin see?
Baby come here, c'mon, baby don't even trip, just kick it for a lil while
You know what I'm sayin?  I'll take you to Sizzler to go eat after awhile
I'll make em stop trippin, don't even trip baby its all good
Verse 2: Too $hort/B-Legit
Too $hort:
I'm feelin good, everything hooked up right
Before its all over I'ma be in som'n tight
Looked down at my hip to check my pager
Tryin to find me a bitch, fresh off the stage
Nigga aint hungry, fuck the after party
Told a cute groupie ""Bitch meet me in the lobby""
You know how we do it, told her bring all her friends
Next weekend we gonna do it all again
B-Legit:
I said it out my mouth on the mic real loud
We at the Holiday-Inn, room 510
Bring all the bitches even if they dikes
We hyped, hoes eatin pussy tonight
Seen her in my mug, peepin my game
Lookin like she could take dick in the brain
We all champagne and Cali green
I need a bitch like that on a pimp team
Too $hort:
It's after midnight, can't find the right women
Can't be slippin while you're late night pimpin
Way too many niggas got stuck like that
Waited too late then fucked a rat
Wake up in the mornin, mad as hell
With the wrong bitch in the wrong hotel
Shoulda gave up when you first struck out
Now you tryna get the fuck out
B-Legit:
Man I was drunk when I went out, blow when I woke up
Didn't get to fuck cuz these hoes is ducks
Niggas like me need the head lay on
From bad ass bitches who prefer red bones
Rock microphones, later count G's
Could always spot a rat chasin niggas with cheese
Please, put it on freeze, it don't suit me
What happened to the muthafuckin groupies? (muthafuckin groupies)
Captain Save-A-Hoe:
What happened? nigga they all left, thats what happened
Yall muthafuckas gonna be sittin around all night talkin to each other
Oh thats cool, yall got some muthafuckin Playboy magazines
So I guess thats why yall aint trippin, check this out man
Yall niggas gotta understand one thing man
Bitches don't love to be talked to like that, yall gotta break down
Be cool with a bitch, ya know what I'm sayin?
Show her some caring and shit, understand me?

I used to fuck the dog shit out my biggest

She's all about that get rich
Treat a nigga like the lotto, he's a quick pick
... it's nothin to a boss bitch
What happened to his cash flow?  He lost it
She don't give a fuck about none of you guys
She make you look so bad, I bet you want a disguise
I knew the day and time would come
When she went out in the world and had to find her one
He sponsors all her daily, activities
I'm not her pimp, she don't pay me or give me fees
I just laced her with the game, so she could shake those lames
And try to take her change, I told her make yo' name
And turn the tables on 'em, I call her DJ Break-a-Trick
Cause all your money she'll be takin it
Put her on the pedestal, your queen on the throne
And she's still gon' bring the money home
[Chorus: Too $hort]

(Ye-yeah ye-yeah) What she gon' do?
(Make me say ohh) What she gon' do?
Players better ask a bitch - bitch whatchu gon' do?

(That's what you'll hear me say, boy every dayyyyyyyy)
[Verse Two]
I knew she had potential, to be a real player
Get paid up the ass by a millionaire
She ain't tradin sex, like these broke hoes
Her shit is worldwide, these bitches loco
She took the show on the road, for the fun and the thrills
Now it's nothin but hundred dollar bills
She got a lot of G's, spend 'em how you please
All you broke-ass hoes, get up off yo' knees
Don't go to Hoe College if you want some mo' knowledge
Cause bitches graduate and end up with fo' dollars
You can be a hustler, and never be a baller
He tried to bread her up whenever he would call her
But the bitch was too dumb, to ask for a thang
I try to teach 'em when they young, so they don't pass on the game
And when you get your thang on
Remember where you got your game and where you came from
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
It's obvious, we don't come from the same world
But you still fell in love with the game girl
Now you're, dedicated since you elevated
And you, you never hated, just celebrated
You can't play with the game, you gotta go get it
It's fire - stop drop and then roll with it
Let a baller finance your brand new car
And if he can't do more, you better kick him out the door pimpin
Tell him how you like diamond rings
So fine, that's why he wanna buy you things
Now you spendin and shoppin, like you playin a sport
Cause you listened to the game that you got from Uncle $hort
I'm proud of you - what you grown to be
Don't tell him nothin - you always belong to me
You can travel the world and get your stack on
Just don't be broke when you come back home

Sometimes we lose some good ones mayn y'know?
They don't really understand this playerism
Just gotta break it down to 'em, keep it real y'know?
I'm a P-F-L, sworn to the P.I.
[Verse One]
I spent so many days with you, so many nights
It's nice, I wanted you to be my only wife
We didn't make it, I couldn't take it
I tried to square up, it's too hard I couldn't fake it
And now I see why, since I was knee high
I swore to live and die by the P.I.
And I'm stayin true, born in this game and it's payin too
I wish I could have stayed witchu
But it's over, I love you and I still care
We can kick it any time, but I'm still a player
... damn you got that look I like
I tried to settle down it felt like you took my life
I left town, I got women all around
While I was out soul-searchin, guess what I found?
The more hoes the merrier, you think I wanna marry her?
Bitch that sounds scarier and scarier
I need to have a few wives
Cause I don't wanna come home and tell you lies
In my heart I think I found her if she feels the same
You think I've changed, think I'd play her if I'm still in the game?
Hell yeah! One woman, I don't think so
I let the game be my wife, and I'm faithful
I never do her wrong, I never cheat on her
And if the game was baseball, I'd be on first
[Chorus]
(I see you watchin this) I see you watchin
(I know it looks real hot up in here) It's pimpin baby
(But what's a pimp?) Oh you know
(I say but what's a pimp?)
(They wanna be like this) They wanna be like this
(I know it looks real fly up in here) It's real fly
(But what's a pimp?)
(I say but what's a pimp?)
[Verse Two]
It's like this
I don't lie, I told you what I felt at the time
I wasn't high, I know you see yourself in my rhymes
A lot of women I dealt with, could hear these words
And realize there's no way I could still be hers
Unless you wanna share me with a hot one named Tarrie
And don't get mad at me when I'm out poppin cherries
I know some ladies they just wanna have babies
Collect child support from rich men in Mercedes
It's cool, but that's not what players do
Get with me, those days are over, I swear it's true
You're through, havin sex for nothin
Hopin some day some man'll give you somethin
Your own bank account - don't laugh, it's not funny
You only fucked with him cause he got a lotta money
But you never get paid, don't lie to me
You just look good, and you get to ride for free
What you eat and what you drink, you trade for sex
Pick you up in the Benz, next day in the Lex
Are you happy? Do you think you're, on a roll?
Do you love your life? Are you achievin any goals?
Or are you sad, mad cause it ain't your way?
Call mom and dad they'll be glad that you ain't gon' stay
Or call me, I got a solution
Choose me and then hit the top with your new man
[Chorus] w/ variations
[Verse Three]
I don't have fantasies, just needs
I need more than one woman to please
And she's like a love roller coaster, the thrill never lasts
And I always seem to find some better ass
Some bitch that can suck better, get wetter
She got them super skills to do anything you let her
So I'm done with you, I still care
I love you baby but I'm still a player
I always been aware and I never been scared
Found some magazines on the top they said Player$
I was young but I was old and I wanted those hoes
Found out playin with girls was mo' fun with no clothes
You can call it what you want to, Doctor or House
Hide and Go Get It, then I'm knockin it out
If she ain't widdit, I find another little chick
I'm quick to switch, even when I was six
I had a backup bitch, when my bitch would trip
I'd go play with my other girlfriend and get me a kiss
And at the age of thirty-six I'm to the same old tricks
Too $hort baby no the game don't quit
I'm playin games with these lame brains
Treatin superstars, like some plane Janes
I wanna get new thangs, so I used the game to maintain
Bitch I refuse to change
[Chorus] w/ variations
[unknown singer from Chorus]
Minks and pinky rings and them
Some so why should you begin
Livin, the world that they are perceivin
Ho-ohhh, is everything that you see
Really good enough to be
Part of the pimp life, ohhhhhh
[Chorus] w/ variations to fade (quickly)

Verse 1: (Captain Save 'Em, Too $hort)
Captain Save 'Em:
Yall niggas always talkin bad about a breezy,
Talkin bout that young-ass, rich-ass nigga Too Sheezy
Always callin a woman out a name,
Callin her a ""bee-eye-itch"", now thats a shame
What if somebody called your woman that?
Youd be all up at the century club boy with your stri-nap
Talkin bout ""I'll never save a ho"",
Then why you have that breezy drivin your big-body benz for?
You say you only out to get some head, and then to stab,
But I see you up at Monty's feedin her lobster and crab
They say that Captain is a playa's worst enemy, so whats next?
You just mad cuz I got more hoes than you got diamonds on your rolex
Too $hort:
I realize after makin 6 platinums in a row
The shit was easy, so I had to get some mo'
I never did like stiff hoes,
I fuck like a rap, aint no quick flows
I'm a California nigga, born and bred,
Got a wild imagination when I'm on the bed
I love my woman, I love her girlfriend and her sister,
Felt on her mommas booty but never kissed her
Been mackin on these hoes since the 8-0's,
It don't take much for me to break hoes
You must be dreamin, if my bitch chose you,
We in another lifetime, my game is foolproof
It won't happen, as long as she's my bitch,
I give a fuck if you fake pimps peep my shit
Cuz I'mma mack these hoes like never befo',
And everytime I grab the mic I gotta better flow
Hook
Verse 2: (Too $hort)
I went from rappin about the clothes I was wearin at a party,
To all the hoes that let me see their naked bodies
It's not an overnight transition thing,
I wasn't born pimpin hoes wearin pinky rings
Never walked around sayin ""Who am I?""
Cuz when I seen old movies like ""Superfly""
It was my destiny, to live a pimp legacy,
And reach levels other niggas never see
In '81 I rapped friendly, but now its on,
One day I said somethin on the microphone
About sixteen hoes, suckin ten toes,
People loved it, thats how the story goes
It's true, in 1982,
Me and Freddy B sold the tapes to you
X-rated, talkin bout bitches and thugs,
All the dope-dealers gettin rich sellin drugs
Too $hort bumpin in the background,
You thought I retired, bitch I'm back now
Like a house party, or a side show,
I got the spanish, black and white hoes
Ask an East Oakland nigga, I bet you he know,
""Is she mixed with japanese or fillapino?""
I always spit the game when I rap,
All I wanna know is where the hoes at?

Album:  Players
Song:   Wild Wild West
[$hort]
Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
With his gansta waves and gangsta hoods
He made friends with dealers and crooks
And when the party was on you knew he had come
It is like Gladis Knight and its five oh ones
Walking right up to the dj man
And give another emcee's rap
Cuz they knew about him and his gangsta rap
The fact they just couldn't manage that
He was known around to be the best
So rough hanging tough in the wild wild west
In a land where whips will watch the car
Tell you everything and they still want more
Where live is only give and take
In a land where the strong control the fake
He was known around for all the time
Everybody went wild when he said his rhyme
Said his manly man would come out
With his gangsta ride his turn back side
Out like Jessie Jackson in a land
Where game that controls the lane
Yes the wild wild west that's the place
Suckers take a bite and don't even taste
The California lifestyle that I live
When the sun rolls out every chance it get
The wild wild west that's where you see
Emcee rappers make you look like wheat
Cuz you would never hang in the wild wild west
Without you hoopsta in the wild wild west
You can get down but I don't know where
You come out here you better act scare
Cuz we don't play don't come my way
When you sudden didn't fight you will say
Front me cuz you'll front yourself
I'll leave you standing there mad as that
You can rap your best that's what you do
You just can't hang and you know its true
Like a homeboy said its one two three
West coast raps to the beat
You got have a lot of game to spit that rap
I wanna put a little game to her just like that
Too $hort I thought you knew
You can't count three and then skip two
It just won't work but you might high
You the emcee from seventy five
Girls G.I.R.L.S. so fresh
Emcee rap through the wild wild west
Taking you the weed cuz we don't play
Sucker emcee's do you hear me say
Front me... front me...
Once upon a time there lived a man
In a place that's known as East Oakland
He can rap to the beat like all the rest
So rough hang tough in the wild wild west
With his non stop rapping and his west coast style
He had the whole dang party just going wild
Singing rhymes all time banging back
Turning eight out with the west coast rap
That's when the sucker emcee all came to be
Nothing but everyday sucker emcee's
They were all his friends all his

Starvin like Marvin for a Petey song
Tired of Carolina bein stepped on, stepped over

But I whiffed them other suckers still smokin on my herb
Man I got this, now I'm doin 60 on a backstreet

She won't give up, I keep goin
You wonder how these old-ass hoes keep hoein

Fuck that shit, fuck you hoes (you nasty)
Fuck all y'all, man
Verse 1:
I used to get straight A's, read my books in Catholic school,
Now I find myself in the men's bathroom
With a top-notch, goin wild in the stall,
She aint even trippin cuz shes havin a ball
I used to play with my toys in the back yard,
But now I just walk around and act hard
Alot of women like to be called a bitch,
I'll break it down so you understand all of it
I always thought I was an educator,
I might not love her, but I never hate her
Shes the kind of girl to make your toes pop,
Keep ya wide open, never need nose drops
Now yall wanna get mad at me,
For talkin about another young, nasty freak
Its life, its not a major catastrophe,
You aint a ho cuz you givin up the ass for free, you nasty
I know why yall mad at me, I aint break your heart girl (you nasty)
Man, these bitches trippin (you nasty)
Verse 2:
Too many tight lil dresses with no panties on,
Too many females tryin to take a man home
Where your mommy and your daddy at?
Just because a player got a cadillac
You wanna lay in the back, with your face in his lap,
All you gotta do is taste that
You get to ride, get used all the time,
I aint made the situation I just made the rhyme
Adapt to my surroundings, look around
Nothin but pimps, tricks, and hookers found
In the Town, if you aint one you the other,
I aint fooled, what you gonna do to a brother
Lookin at me, like you wanna eat me,
Didn't even have to use words to meet me
Now we havin sex and I forgot your name,

I dont know why you trippin (you nasty)
I told yall I was gonna call you (you nasty)
After awhile
Verse 3:
I understand where your anger comes from,
Cuz Ive been talkin bad on the mic since day one
Never took the time to explain myself,
But keepin it real is somethin I cant help
I know some real women, I know some real hoes,
And male-bashing songs, I dont feel those
But I'm glad you bi-sexual women came out,
Dont tell em what we did and keep my name out your mouth
If it wasn't for the groupies or for the oral sex they gave me,
I'd treat you all like ladies
Im just a victim of society,
Look me in my eyes and dont lie to me
You ever had a one-night stand and go to church the next day?
A full night of play, wake up and pray
Wishin you could stay, but you caint'
Oh you a good girl today? You aint no saint, you nasty
Oh yeah I know I fucked you too (you nasty)
You know what Im talkin bout?
You need to take this muthafuckin opportunity
And have some big fun (you nasty)
I got some drinkin in the kitchen baby (you nasty)
My niggas comin through (you nasty)
Oh, its cool girl (you nasty)
We gon' work this shit out, beeyotch!

A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
'Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
Duckin the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this
[Hook 2x]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
[Hook]
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

Big thighs with brown-eyes
It's Lil Weezy for real
Only Cash Money Hot Boy that stood still
I got a good deal
I'm from a trill hood
I smoke real good
Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood
Pipes, rally stripes and fog lights
T-shirt white, three stripes with all ice
What that boy name
Birdman junior, huh
Fool was smile but five is so wild
I can smoke a green mile
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby
Bling-blao, I rock a throwback Jordan 23
Rolling on hot 23's
Tote a big glock 23
You're looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans
My block living me
I want you to look hard at some easy money
Stop playing this is Weezy company
Uh-huh

I'm the son of Cash Money
The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Why? Cuz I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bent
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint
Leaves on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Sucking on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book
[Hook]
Some call me Weezy
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'ma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze
So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas
And beating went to the A
Eat with JAZZY FAY
But yeah I'm on my way
Cuz I know he got that hay
Hey little mami
You a ghetto fire ten
You come to my post on the island
Come on that chronic
He-he empty vodka bottles
I be high he be drunk that my roll model
I rolls by you with my seat reclining
When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding
Cash Money what you hollering, huh

“Looked up the dj, and said may I”

“Blow and pow like 4th of July explosives”
“Lit it up, like the 4th of July”

[Prodigy]
[Chorus:]
We doing it, getting our paper
we ain't rookies, we major
name brand gangsters, you still a demo taper
niggaz they wanna hate us
bitches they wanna rape us
everyday is like July 4th nowadays coz
we moving independent units
we sold out in any store in the US
getting that independent cake
we sold out in any store in the UK
[Twin Gambino]
We came to pop in
got ya ladies, draw dropping
nobody can stop us, I was brought up in the projects
and I got, tonz of haze from uptown
we not trying to sell that shit, that's how we burn it down
niggaz always drilling me, ‘till they see my four pound
bitches always feeling me, try to give me some head
while I'm in the studio, try to make that bread
not a contriet dude, or of with ya head
yo, 1st Infantry and fed
we gonna give you that gangsta music that hurts your ears
but the fear in ya heart, when you see the gift
we think big, A-L-C we get right
[Evidence]
Yo, everytime I rest, I put it all on the line
yo money never slept
that's why I barely get blessed
that's why I rarely go out, unless it's love at the club
time is bread, that's what I'm about
and all my peoples got cloud
check the resume
one step closer to goal everyday
the game is to be sold not told
I tropping heavingly, world connected got the livest crew
we infinite, dropping gems but no clue
[Chorus]
[Alchemist]
Every dollar I spend on wax , I turn it back into cash
Jetting back to the lab, I'm getting back on my job
I'm fully backed by the Mobb, I keep my back to the wall
keep the blacks to my wall
I'm trying to stack till I ball
untill they cashing ‘em all
I wanna stack till this tall
ain't gonna rap for to long
gonna have to move on
I'm gonna stash till I'm gone
green grass on my longue
fuck a bank account, I need extreme cash in my palm
smoke blur in ya vision,
you don't know who ya dissin'
I don't learning no lesson
I just hold my position
I don't go with a pistol
they just know I'm official
shit, all I gotta do is start blowing a whistle
my name is ringing
my chain is swinging
right now I'm speaking, but these beats are what I'm famous for fleaking
[Twin Gambino]
It's like rolling dice, we taking the bank tonight
cut your face with a knife, now your scared for life
all I want is ice, a car, a girl and a crib
tired of doing biz, I just wanna live
take care of my kids, fuck all that stress
never wore a vest, only holding tecs
[Chorus]
[Evidence]
We sold out every store in L.A.
It's loyalty where I stay, but ain't promised today
I keep my headlights on for 9-1-1
and on July 4th I might shoot one at the sun
independent regardless of the fact I'm a signed artist
fuck a deal it matters who comes hardest
when I entertain, It's like I took Sedrick for his name
hunger is just a different form of pain
I'm ready to eat, ready to hear my name spread on the street
to the point where I don't talk, my trackrecord speaks
to the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks
to the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week
bringing the heat, so clear you understand me
raise the stakes, up the antique
the better place, yo we land on winds
Dilated, Evidence, Alchemist, Big Twins
- Check it out

Huh
What?
What?
Let's go, nigga (Where you at, Wheezy?)
You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', ""Where's this bastard's crack?!!""
I flash the Mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, ""Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!""
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?
[Hook-2x (Lil Wayne)]
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
[Lil Wayne]
I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita
Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers
Wow (wow, wow) you can catch me in all black with no smile
Me, Turk, G'z and ouch - chicka-POW!
How come these niggaz keep burnin the world
and why the hell this nigga Weezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal, Bentley drop
Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?
[Hook]
[Lil Wayne]
Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Blast the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play? Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
A nigga either gon' get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit it, lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your blocks
And if there's, coke involved then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga Super Sosa, run up in your crib
while your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you (?) chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?

I played on Martin, call me hustle, man
And now y'all know I'm the yee-yo muscle, man

That rumble in the side of ya stomach, piled on water
How do you want it, come through in a Coupe powder blue or
High with water, how do you want it man
Ay, I towed a lot of tullies dun, I den broke a lot of hoopties dun

Oh, I say the same thing till I'm old and grey
For I falloff and rap about my clothes and chains
Grippin' grain and poppin' trunks, Dawg that ain't me
These elbows hit the scene back in '83
I stay street with it, dun asked that
You can find me in your hood pumpin' monster crack
I rollover rodents with rims on em
Sniffing out a rat, I expose them and then bend on em
I lotta bitches but they claiming they O.G.s

Still a busta ass rapper I'm refusing to be
Scarface seem to think I'm the king,
You're a fool if you think,
There's another new, young rapper dude out there that's cooler than me
I choose in the V, brand new with the beat
I live real life like I say I do in the beat
Yeah, true indeed I do indeed
Do it for the O.G.s and the true MCs
Them bustas say this year I got brand new and it's all phat
But the fightin' in the club, I'm done with all that

Oh you know, I got Currency's new album

Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that ""I Can't Feel My Face Shit"" they know that
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did
I'm feelin' like a black Republican
Naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high
Higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim
Ai!

If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen
I feel like a black Republican
Tote a MAC'n Republican
Act so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets call but the heat make me feel covenant
Been done had cake day late like Anne Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like polident
New Orleans represent it to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Pick a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be
And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Draught 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards 'cause you can't face yourself
Assholes

Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz
And you know I put the mags on that
.45 mack with the flash on that
Who want it
Everybody sing along
[Hook x2]
Now I'ma ride cuz I got riding in my bloodline
And I'ma shine cuz I got shining in my bloodline
I get that dough cuz I got hustle in my bloodline
I bleed concrete
[Verse 2]
And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3]
I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music
And the Blueprint
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit
like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez

Hard hat no but I got the tool on
And you should be my paper if ever the tool drawn

Give me a big fine bitch in a dress
One put them lips in effect
Suck the dick 'til the shit in her chest
You can piss on her brest
I like that shit
Project hoes like that dick, Don't bite that dick
Give me a Spanish sweet hoe
Black from Puerto Rico
Freak ho, Specialize in givin' me deep throat
Really dont care how short how plump, short or thick
Give me head, Don't care, Swallow cum don't spit
Aww shit, I like them Jamicians and them Hatians
Niggas can't take it when they shake an make me rape 'em
White girl's I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it
Its off tha chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brain
But watch them hoes who want the change
Its not a game
Or short cuban hoe, With a fat ass though
An I'll keep the bitch just like Fidel Castro
[Chorus:]
[UnPlugged]
Tell me what you like
Let me tell you what I like
You goin' on an breakin' me off by the end of the night
You can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans
Ain't tryin' to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
[Verse 2:]
[Lil Wanye]
Weezy the hottest
Drinkin' Barcadi
I stream through the scene on a Lincon on Robbers
Lookin' for the finest dime, To wine and dine

Hold up lil mama, Slow ya ass down
Pick it up, Throw ya ass down
Now throw ya ass around
An scream me name
I can't hear you say it louder what (Wayne, Wayne)
A damn shame
Better watch that boy he nasty
I strap on a plastic
Break ya off like elastic
Put the dick in the middle, Make it wiggle for ya'll
Might be small, But that dick ain't little at all
I like a short thick broad, Fat ass an shit

Matter of fact when I see her, Pull her Over like a cop
Juve coulda Backed It Up an I woulda Dropped It Like Its Hot
Ha Ha, Ya heard me
Ha Ha, Unplugged

[Verse 3:]
[Mannie Fresh]
I like them big, round, yellow and brown
A bitch that take it from the back and make the (Ugh Ugh) sound
Now you can bounce, slide, drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it hit a nut, hit a nut
Bounce for ya hood, Shake for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga who got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, Hold up ???
My bitch got thong, You bitch got drawls
My chick like to swallow, Yo chick like to spit
If yo chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, Chill out, Wait a minute stop
My Ginseng, Viagra, and a Strawberry pop
See I'm feelin' kinda bold, Why don't ya bring a friend
From vigina to the asshole do it again
I want a yucky down misses bout whatever
Yo mama loved a Tymer, Now you welcome
You ok Lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love me dick

Callin' Lil' Wayne (Wayne) a...
...Killa! Wha? Wha?
Killa! Wha? Wha? Check!
Hold up, you not under the deep cover of the lil' slugga,
Callin' me head busta, Run with me 'K, bluka,
Nigga's done fled from-a... me infrared, sucka,
If him wan' play, busta... come make me day, busta,
Bein' half-way out my nappy head,
But I don't care, I just grab my clip, slap and spray,
Anywhere, it don't matter where a nigga stay,
Jus' believe it when I say, ""Guerrilla Warfare""
I swear, there be some more drama up out these bags,
Nigga's in black, drive Jags, camou-flage rags,
Nigga's domes get bust wide open, with blood and sweat,
Nigga's ridin' off in Hummers - laughin', drinkin' Moet,
You know me.. Coullion, standin' four feet..
I'm to-ting cannons, wearin' Rolie's,
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game,
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man,
See, when I spin-a you Ben' bet' not be on you block,
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my no'gga, you drop
Now where yo' nigga's at, comradie? They not wit'chu nah,
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop,
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama..
Thuggin' in broad day with four glocks, a knife, and a choppa,
I'm runnin' away, don't get in my way... My nigga...
Callin' me head busta! Callin, callin' me killa!
(Hook 2x)
Them call'un me killa..
Them call'un me head busta, Cash Money nigga,
My niggy, when I'm out late..
Call me what you want.. Full of blunts..
Look out your window, see where them from? Me!
Check! Now as the heat flame up...
Them lookin'-a down the street, them think they see Wayne' truck,
Him whole block gon' scare, 'cause me get me thing and bust,
Them know that Hot Boys known to be danger-ous,
That U.P.T. come down Chopper City, in the ghetto, my man,
Now who that be in the car with the choppa? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne,
I get my 'K - cock, aim, and put holes in your brain,
Give me that rag, you ain't no solja, wipe the blood off my chain,
Gettin' blisty... off in a black F-150,
Bout to do the old usual - hit your block, just spittin,
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin,
Respect me for who I be: Seventeen, head-busta, Because...
(Hook 2x)
Check! Ori-gin-AL Hot Boy, land-cruisin' with guns,
I shall be the one, who burn the block up,
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic, Leave ya hopeless in a alley,
Now, when a nigga runs up...
If the nigga love his life, he wouldn't have his guns up
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy...
And got boys... that got toys... to stop noise,
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave them set empty,
Down him there street 'cause him want beef,
Now, me tried to tell lil' stupid boy, ""Don't mess-a with me.""
Now look at him - open up his casket and see,
Click-clack my Mac', twist my fitted cap to the back,
Jump in the black 'Lac, scream ""War"", and just.. pow! pow!
How you love me now?  With five barrels to your eye,
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die,
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip,
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip,
Who behind the gun slang... blunt hang... and twisted?
It's Mis-ter Wayne, Come splittin' when I spit...
(Hook 2x)
See, them callin' me killa.. Ha?
Because them callin' me killa... Wha?
Them nigga's callin' me killa,
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga...
Wha? Callin' me killa... (Killa)
Callin' me killa... (Killa)
Them callin' me killa... (Killa!)

That's the AK-47, make his neighborhood love me
Bullets like birds, you can hear them bitches humming
Don't make that bird shit, he got a weak stomach

Heat him then leave him stinking
Sharks surround him and eat him, nice to know him
I will... roll over your squad like I'm ""One Punch"" Carr

Steppin' over competition, man I love these Nikes
Yeah, I'm hot, they fannin'

Don't try to compare I'm in a league of my own

And i hope dat she is having da ride of her life
No red lights inside, jus a bare room wit green lights ummm mmm

Haahaaa thats ur hoe my guns of water help your garden grow...no
Yeah i know dat wuz crazy
But i think u are more crazy..yer
Than her
Cuz she is no daisy
Shit she jus pottery
Wit no seeds
So she cant eat
My heroes had da broads and da cars wit big ol' rims
And i could remember slangin, thinkin
I wanna be like them
Ever since i was little, ever since i was little
I lived life numb
It made so much since for me to run
When da 5-0 come
Cuz i aint dumb umm mmm
And dat shit i hated
Like early 90s late 80s
I wuz husltin as a baby
U can ask eagle street, about me

And da sheets be stickin like pages
And da bed is so stanky
If she say dat is my baby, shit it is prossibly not for me

We stay low from the ranges cause they tryin to tame us, but we brainless
And just think, I'm one sell out record away from being famous
Shit I guess I ain't it
You could paint it how you may, but I remain this gangsta 'til the day I lay
where the worms stay
I spit it for my nigga's sake
I spit it for myself a long time ago
Got a few houses, few whips, few condos
I'm so straight I'm pointin
The game is hurtin, and baby boy the ointment
Baby boy the president now

You should come join 'em
Do check the label
And make sure it's yellow or rose 'fore you bring it to my table

[Verse 2:]
Bitch i spent a hundred winters on my snow cone
lil nigga walking like he get his bowl on
Bossy, pimp stro pimp stro, and i gotta let my money go when the wind blow, bet it come right back like a rental, and bet them bitches understand me like 10-4, niggas is simple, like instrumentals, i bet you bitches understand me like info, get your top chopped, and get trimmed low
Somethin like my Benz tho
Ride with my friends hoes, i mean my hoes friends, fucking all my hoes friends, takin all my hoes ends, it'll make that blow spin
I tell these young niggas pimp or die, dont get that Benz, if they dont split them I's, dig them thighs, in them tires
And if you reach at I, I dont preach I speech and give you beef wit them fries
Come to the beach and find, I live where all the little sea eagles fly
See, baby im so high, all i need you to do is just shut up and cry, bitch bitch shut up and cry
[Verse 3:]
Look, and me and mack was just to niggas from the same hood, fell from the same tree, cut from the same wool
Im just the lion and he the young bull, not seemy the bull, that pistol on my hip than i got a hammy to pull, i had a lammy in school, i think it was diablo red, im t.i. red, im t.i. red, you d.i. ed, because of what you said
Chea, and im as sharp as an image, and i keep it bumpin like a mother fuckin blemish
Two twins drink me up like guiness, when im finished i say brilliant, when im finished they say Weezy you killed, i hope on your shit and they say Weezy you healed it
So fly got wings tattooed on me, the gun glued on me, but i pop you in your stomach, now i got ya yesterdays food on me, now that was real rude homie
And i smell like a weed plant, young money mother fucker where cheese at

Dough is what I got, lil mama
Dough is what I got, pretty lady
Dough is what I got, shortie
Dough is what I got, baby
c'mon, I'm paid {*4X*}
[Lil Wayne]
Give a woman none, uh-huh
I already gave my brother some, it's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
At the world in the barrel of the pistol term
Where we get it how we live never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow cause you is concerned
Only down south rapper could've been in a firm
Or the Kommision or Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I can kick it like Liu Kang nigga
Got the Sub-Zero flow how you owe my mon
Nigga get over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to the recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I wasn't ranged for my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant up in Orleans
Same coach, same game, been starting
... Same tri-level offense
I come through the lane like dargent
Learn from me niggaz is lame they call charging
I have no brain I'm retarded
We are not the same I'ma Martian
You can't be my chain I'm your target
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late september whatever you call it
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guardin him
You will just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's bossy
I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm ""What's up"" like ""Martin""
[Lil Wayne]
See I know y'all be talking about and you don't like what you here sometimes
but um um since I'm so bright I'ma put the spotlight on you baby
[Chorus]
Show me what you pop, lil daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin
I know what you not, wodie
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up now
Blaze {*4X*}
[Lil Wayne]
Tell the world take six
Young dictionary make words make sense
Then I make sense make dollars
Make the skinny girl holla
Make the fat girl hungry
Make the ugly girls want me
But the pretty girls on me
Make the shy girls horny
Make the fly girls corny
And only for me because I'm too
I.A.M. holla back in the morning
Now holla back if you on see
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit I don't condone it
Aw baby just hop on it
[Chorus]
Show me what you got, lil mama
Show me what you got, pretty lady
Show me what you got, shortie
Show me what you, baby
You rappers ain't

I know, I know, Weezy Wee, this dedicated to my father
Damn nigga, y'all excuse the expressions
What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise
[Chorus 2x]
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some ""squash it"" and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these
bitches
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me
[Chorus]
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said ""thay's my peoples""
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
'Cause I lost my father, and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
Duckin the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this
[Hook 2x]
Look, I don't curse, but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And my own family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
[Hook]
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the world

Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street
I ain't no thief, I'm just tryin to eat
Man fuck the police and president (Geeoorrrggiiaa) Bush
So what happened to the leverage, why wasn't they steady
Why wasn't they able to control this?
I know some fok' that live by the lever
that keep on tellin me they heard this, stole this
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy
1965, I ain't too young to know this
That was President Johnson now
but it's president (Geeoorrggiiaa) Bush
[Chorus - 2X]
We from a town where (Georgia)
Everybody drowned, and
Everybody died, but baby I'm still prayin wich ya
Everybody cryin but (Georgia)
Aint nobody tried, there's no doubt on my mind it was (Georgia) Bush
Noooowwww
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map
New Orleans baby, now the white house hatin, tryin to wash away like we not on the map
Wait, have you heard the latest, they sayin you gotta have paper if you tryin to come back
Niggas thinkin it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from (Geeoorrggiaa)
Noooww it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say dont worry bout it
And the children have been scarred, no ones here to care bout em
And fash out, to all the rappers that helped out
Yea we like it they callin y'all, but fuck president (Geeoorrggiaa) Bush
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollas, but he do drop bombs
R.I.P. Tay cuz he died in the storm, fuck president (Geeoorrggiiaa) Bush
See us in ya city man, give us a pound
Cuz if a nigga still movin then he holdin it down
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!
[Chorus]
(DJ Drama: oh yea, you thought we was done? Naw)
YEA!
Money money money get a dollar and a dick
Weezy Baby that crack, muthafucka get a fix
Got money out the ass, no homo but I'm rich
Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist YES
Yep, I'm a muthafuckin trip
I'ma trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit
Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams
If you talkin bout bricks, I'm the interstate man
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring
Walkin a thin line, gotta defend mine
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM
Young toon, yea that's what my people call me
Fifty thousand for the cause, tryin keep the reaper off me
I drink a lotta syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walkin
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be da target
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded
We done lost everythin and you lookin like a bargain
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant
I'm the best rapper in the game no argin (arguing)
And I don't ever write, pause
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag
Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me
Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya
I'm a beast, I'm a preacher, I'm the son of miss cita
Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her
Got a topic of this evenin, hotter than a tub steamin
Gotcha girlfriend dreamin of one day bein Trina
Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer
Got a white girl drivin, couldn't do it much cleaner
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos
Price sizin for a show and the flow
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse

While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like ??? come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin, hey its time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like ambasol
But he heard
[Chorus 1]
Uh oh
There go them fuckin po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
hem gangstas doin time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tecks
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fetti
Be on the block until them souljas hit it
That's when he heard....
[Chorus 2]
Blocka
Me come to tear your block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner
All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is boomin
The hottest D in town lookin for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin qp's to ki's
Gangin in the cheese, them bricks is comin
No droughts I don't sit on nothin
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay em a visit
That's when ya heard....
[Chorus 3]
Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner
[Chorus 1,2,3,3 repeat 2x]
Uh oh, you better get off the corner, skirt
Blocka, you better get off the corner
Come here, you better get off the corner
Get off the corner, Get off the corner

It's H-B Weezy Wee off the streets
Stay deep 'Cedes Jeep big feet
Gazer seats hold the bare floors
I faithfully hold to pimp whores
You ate with me and you gon get yours
This eight with me that's bullets through doors
Got haze in me now I'm so tall
Come blaze with me cuz Beaky got more
And now or later I'm major player
I ball right I need an agent player
Ay ma you tight you need to page a player
That's so tonight you can taste a player
I got the burner on the waist if you flinching
My shit turning on 28-inches
My shit burning like 500 plus
And this album's a three permer and a clutch
[Hook]
24/7 (Yes, sir)
I go hard (Go hard, go hard, go hard)
Not here
[Verse 2]
I claim squad game till no more Wayne remain
Bang my thing till no more lane remain
Use the left lane man cook up the cocaine
Dudes a lil game and get her to do brain
That boy Weezy is a bad mother-feezy
Me and Young Jazze at the back of one tweezy
I'm so breezy off the Velvie and the perk
Now I'm getting head on the balcony on Bourbon
Apple and Eagle is the street that I shop
The Birdman my daddy and we fly south
And we don't go to work man we get work out
And the bricks may go as low as ten up in the drought
Niggaz is selling and you should be buying
Niggaz is telling and you should be dying
Niggaz is yelling Cash Money till they kill me
C-M-B, I know you gotta feel me
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
You know if I'm doing it I'm probably doing it for the block
I'm out here bitch I got this here on lock
Come out here bitch I bet this here gon pop
I got ya slick this my year don't knock
Speakers from the front to the rear gon rock
Wood-grain handles to steer it's all hot
I never drove factory and I don't own stock
I drop that bitch on chrome chops, yeah
[Hook till end]

And I don't walking around looking for it ya know
But yesterday it seemed to just wonder around till it found me you know like
Gossip found me
Then why don't you try prove it
How?
You don't know how to prove it,
Well what you just you do is..
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop,
Stop hating on a n*gga that is a weak emotion
The lady of a n*gga
And You can get tip like you waiting on a n*gga
Put a body bag in the apron on a n*gga
I give my all behind the mic
But you could never see if you sit behind the light
You don't have to pick me
To win the title fight
But I'm gonna wear that championship belt so tight
and if I'm wrong there is snow white
And if I'm wrong there is no white
I'm trying to be polite
But you bitches in my hair like the fucking po-lice
My flow is rare
These other rappers nice
These other rappers bark
Some of them even bite
Some other even bite
But I'm much more bright
I give the game sight
So before you dim the light
You just might might wanna
Think it over, think it over, ooo think it over baby
Stop!
Stop analyzing
Criticizing
You should realize
What I am is 'n start epitomizing
Legitimate
Got the heart of the biggest lion
Confident like fuck em all
Pull out my dick and ride it
My flow sick so sick its like my shit is dyin'
It rains a lot in my city
Cause my city's cry's'
'cause my cities dyin'
But I emerge from all of that
I am a livin' pioneer
Zion
Fear god not them
Steer my robbin' coupe through the streets to the booth and sue woop
Then I leave a tub in the booth
I leave a blood bath
Sorry there's a tub in the booth
Now where the drugs at
Like the strings on the shoe
No nigga fuck that
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot
Now Where new Orleans at?
I feel hip hop stole me like a bus pass
So in your possession
I must ask
Hey haven't I been good to you tell me haven't I been sweet to you
Drag my name through the mud
I come out clean
Cast away stones
I wont even blink
A gun is not a math problem
I wont even think
Just leave you dead like the mink under my sink
Don't believe in me
Don't believe me
I graduated from hungry
And made it to greedy
My flow is like pasta
Take it and eat it
But I'm gonna need cheese if I'm makin' a ziti
You niggas want beef
I want a steak and a weevy
Lost in Amsterdam but Jamaica where we be
Hard body nigga takin' it easy
All about my paper bout my paper like easy
why do rappers, why do rappers, lie to fans
Lot a rappers, lot a rappers lie like actors
Cut the mother fucking camera
Cut the check
Fuck your props
I AM hip hop
& i ain't dead I'm alive.

What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit
look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga
Geezy, Juve and turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg
[Verse 1]
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch
I ride D L into the C L Gun right in my grip
I slip a clip in every rip, cas hatas like ????? trip
Come home to my future wife and every nite she'll flip
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit
But I like when we split drink ??? without ice when I'm pissed
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly
And I know I might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start
Its like I'm livin happy now
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now
And that kinda juice me up
and I smoke about 3 blunts and puff a cooler bust me up
And say a prayer for everyday
jus so I get through the stuff but I be like
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man
and when u feel like everythang is goin wrong man
I'm gone stand cas I am a GROWN MAN
[Verse 2]
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up
And usually I'm feed up thinkin everythangs a set up
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts
And I get hit up with all kinda stress and put up wit the stuff
But I mantain to climb through it all and I still manage to be
Lil wayne therefore I shine and I ball
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that theres a tomorrow
and I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awful
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a salute and someway
I still pick it out and shuffle out ???
And I don't need nobody ???? keep yo advice and jus dumit
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit
And plus I no my fathers watchin and my mothers the dearest
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate wat we do
but jus no if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through
[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3]
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so happy
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say its a game
And even though I grew apart and I have gracefully change
I'm always strict so I'll forever be facin a change
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it
Take care of them family first busta look weed is a habit
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeeded ????
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone
And I dawg I do belive I'm grown so I'll be good on my own but I be like
[Chorus]
fading.......Believe Dat

Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk

Direct from my blurb, a fast baller with a curve
Have her slidin' home, tellin' her friends just in the third

What's false and what's true an...girl listen

Got a early call from Kisha
Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then l'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her
Said l needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater
And playin with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cuz I heard she was a freak
They say she ???
But I don't want HIV
?????
Her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said oooohhhh Kisha
This what I got to meet her
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro
Oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep
I got some more meat to feed ya
(Turk)
Now I'm hot
I wonder was up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call
See if it's alright
For me to dip through
She said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good
I'll be there in a minute
But I didn't know Lil Wayne was already hittin it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me dippin in but he didn't know ???
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass hoe
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Call my nut now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got through lil tonight me and the H-Beezey
I can't be late
I'm gone see ya when I could
Here's Juve on the hip
Let 'em know it was all good
(Juvenile)
Ooohh Oooh there she go
On the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know
He done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed
She told me for Danny
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and now I said fuck it
Say boo I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good and you have it not to telly
(B.G.)
Bitch hold on do I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no wores
But she told me she'd do a damn job on them boys
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall  his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be ano or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head

Knockin'-it-off-your-shoulder soldiers - them real niggas
Niggas who did time - hard-to-kill niggas
How you live, you get it is the way a nigga play it
Niggas ain't fightin' no more - niggas bustin' your head
Sendin' you to your grave - it's do or die, cousin
Aimin' straight for your head, makin' sure you die, cousin
They dressin' in black, prepared for combat
Ridin' four deep strapped with choppers and macks
Not givin' a fuck, gettin' your cut, lettin' it bust
You get hit, that's on you, my nigga - you're outta luck
You're stuck like chuck - wodie, you're assed out
That's what happen to ya tryin' to be hard, runnin' your mouth
Get erased, my nigga (my nigga)
Look here: I leave no trace, my nigga (my nigga)
No witnesses so can you see my face, my nigga (my nigga)
Fled the scene - so you have no case, my nigga- -case, my nigga
Look here: you can play if you wanna get down
Get your stupid ass left where you can't be found

I was wrong for a lot of shit that I'ma take to my grave
Continuously whippin' niggas like a runaway slave
Must was meant for me to be thuggin' - I stay in some beef
Baby and Slim keep tellin' me, ""Juvenile, stay off them streets.""
I can't help - I draw attention; they be fuckin' with me
I'm hot in the ass and can't get enough of these streets
A lil' nigga in the Rolls screamin', ""Fuck the police!""
Peelin' out in front the club, about to duck to the east
Now play yourself, you gon' find yourself by yourself
In a nice place ducked off with fucked up health
I done been strucked and snuck, but never fucked and stuck
My life is four hundred degrees, so I bust 'em up
Still stickin' to the g-code, Ree's, and B's
Quit drinkin', but I will smoke some weed indeed
All they understand is my project English
And if you don't like it, you can kiss my penis

You a killer, nigga? (Eah?) Ain't no fear in my heart
I'll go toe to toe with ya or take ya to war
I'll even go K for K with ya - now make your choice
Better know when I'm in beef that I be creepin', nigga
Better know that I'm a snake, and I'ma sneak ya, nigga
Each time I hit the corner, I be leavin' niggas
Momma upset - can't even go on and grievin', nigga
Nothin' change - I'm on TV, I don't play with you niggas
Still the same that'll spin broad day on you niggas
And empty a hundred out that K
Where you're caught hangin' is where you're left stankin', ya heard me

So many murders under my belt, I done lost count
If you wanna be another number, my nigga
Go ahead, drop your nuts, and run up, my nigga

Hello, world
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy
Glock cookin', boy
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'
Spark or lace somethin'
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

Even the baddest be gettin murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets
Like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison
Wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell
Ah possibility of livin' well
But if they killin' me
I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosing to sell
I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figga addicted to these fucking streets
[EDI]
Now put your muthafucking hands up
If you'se a rider (Ride)
Niggaz ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)
Fuck em' all, touch em' all
That's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man I'm as strong as this game
Ya'll be knowing my name (Edi)
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane
Gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash and my next piece of ass
So fuck em' all
[Chorus]
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: Come put your hands up in the air
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: I do my girl all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homey to call me
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: Back off I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
YOUNG NOBLE: Nigga, we Outlaw ridah'z
Don't give a fuck if ya love us we thuggin'
I got glad bags with enemies
Cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessey
So they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick em' and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass, Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For the profit pick my glock up
I'm bustin' in self defense ya see
Poppin' nobody got em' Holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy (Why?)
Cause they'll never stop us
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger bust somebody in the movie
Now I want to do it too
Ohh, ohh niggaz is too through
True to the game
I claim Outlaw riders
We give a fuck what they try
I'm..
Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggaz for they watch and chain
Kick back lil nigga, and watch the game
Get your mobb rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin' like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot
Trust me
[Napoleon]
Even my hood call me baby Malcolm X
With the teck's
Shower some slugs on em'
I've got a brother don't rest, and he keep some drugs on him
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen faces of death? That's what my nine do
[Kastro]
I keep my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
With my back against the wall
Like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat
I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world
This guerilla team of mine
Screamin'
Thug Life bitch, fuck 'em all
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
And die for em'
Even if them the last nigga left I'ma ride for em'
Feel me?
Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
Fuck em' all
Let them die
That's my slogan
Fuck em' all
[Chorus]
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
[YOUNG NOBLE:] Come put your hands up in the air
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
[YOUNG NOBLE:] I do my girl up by my lonely
Don't need no phony homey to call me
(That's right bitch, fuck 'em all)
[YOUNG NOBLE:] Back off I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you

Young money is the label
Let us in the door, coming in this bitch all red to the floor
And I'm blooded soowoo and I'm blooded soowoo
I got bloods on stage bloods at my shows
Fuck with my bloods got blood on your clothes
And I'm blooded soooowooo (2)
Once again its on, yea I'm back in the booth
Stand at the top like a tac in the roof
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talking about me but I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lying I'm the motherfucking truth
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof
They hating on me I'm just trying to be weezy
Just like young jeezy in lambobingghini
Smoked out my mind baby and now I'm seeing 3D
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my DC
All red so these hoes know who we be

Gettin high on a yacht call it sea weed

Yea, I advance my flow and they must like that
They like it so much, they say they write that
Barkin at the dog, but I don't bite back
I ain't CPR I ain't bringing they life back
Bad CPR bad bitch on a bite back
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack
I'm gonna shine, I live with light hat

Brand new coupe same color as the sky
The dash same too, lord know I'm gonna try
Cop pull me over lord know I'm gonna lie
They go up in my trunk lord know I'm gonna fry
Them niggas throwing salt all over my fries
So I'm gonna just walk all over them guys
Niggas throwing darts never hit the bullseye
Young money bitch new Orleans east side
Chorus
Yea, been around the world rep the same thang
Been around the world its the same gang
B's up B's up flame gang braa braa braaa braaa bang bang
I told my homie streets can't sleep on life
So he popped the X pill and didn't sleep all night
I ain't worried bout you I'm just trying do me
Last album did 2 I'm just trying do 3
I am what every pair of eyes ought to see
Bitches just wish they could call and order me
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5
Cash money made her say never mind I'm fine

Dread lock swing down me back like Reppunsle.
My bread don't swing. Dem packs in a bundle;
We'll take your tings, sell it back to your uncle.
And we'll make it rain till your dances will come true;
We'll make it rain so you betta bring a swimsuit.
Alone when I came, but I'm leavin with them two;
Gals give me brain, give me brain like temples.
And him got the game, game sharp like a pencil;
And if you want formage we can crash like a symbol.
And Let prepare me window, on my new sports coupe;
twelve hoarses in the hood, sittin on hoarse shoes.
Come from the land that Jesus walked through;
Sacrifice me life, man I bleed for me uncle.
Them no want to run, run with me them no want to;
Murder them, and the family them belong to.
Next ting them kno I run a street like a cardoor;
You go after me, me I dearly depart you.
Hip hop is mine now, Mine what you gone do?;
I can jump on any nigga song and make a part two.
Playtime for me, cuz see to me, they are cartoons;
how come every joint be on point like a harpoon?
How come evry bar stand strong like a barstool?;
how come every line is so raw you gone snort too?
Murder them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them.
Man murda them. Man I murda them. Fuck a competition, man I murda them. ...
and that is why i'm hot...
Its Da Drought 3, Welcome.

I tell 'em no lie
I blow by wit the Bentleys wit the O eyes
I low-ride, cuz these 20 inch rims just make it so hot
You know I, been had Twinkie, look at the pinky
And the link be all the way down to the nuts, diamonds twinklin'
They think you need to stop they say it's not called for
It's such a small car for it cost more than a ballpark
See my life is high priced, a lot a room a lot a bling
My ice is like Andrew Dice ""Ba-Da-Boom, Ba-Da-Bing""
I'm tryin' to see flying in a Lamborghini
Wit your girl right beside me in a tan bikini
Cut the music down and tell her, ""hey ya man's a weenie""
Plus I'm hot and got more iceberg than damn Bananeeie
And I'm just a teenager and I make this dough
Pull out my bankroll and Bill Gates still broke
And I keep it on a hush but I'm richer than normal
And a frost bit wrist, have me sniffin' the carpet

You know, pistol on my side fully loaded
I drive slowly, wit televisions watching Kobe
Pull over by some broad; make her hop right in a blow me
And suck a nigga drive, then its, ""slut get out my ride""
Have you heard about, shorty be Iceberged out
Got them birds real affordable, so get the word out
And you still can see the grill wit the lights burn out
Nothin' lil' about the wheels on my bright orange drop
I'm thuggin' and pimped out, flossin' and glissed out
Sit my arm in warm water, I'm throwin' my wrist out
Got quarters in this house, ki's in that van,
Got ounces in her ride, and G's in that bag
Shhh, You hear that, here come Weezy on his way in a platinum leer jet
We gamblin' nigga bet, bet nigga disrespect and he get dampled and wet
Whole goddamn family get trampled wit that

Jiggy, jump, jiggy, jiggy, jump, jiggy, jump, jive
Alright I bounce for the 17 and jump for the Grover
Just put TV's and bump in the Rover
Slump the bitch over, cum on her shoulder
Bet I make the slut eat it up like yogurt
Wrists is ferocious, dick just bogus
Fuck a hoe watch she come back like a chorus
Life on Ann Deloris met her in a ???
She like to snort coke, you should see the size of her nose is
We really the ones controllin', no choices
And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention
all our rides are dubbed like blank tapes
I really think my jewelry and lights have somethin' in common
Cuz everytime you put them bitches on they start shinin'
The shit is mind blowin'
As a matter of fact I got a bitch that's mind blowin'
She give my head a blow job, I guess she's mind blowin'

The ""fireman"" bitch like my body in the oven.
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin to get a dozen.
My name like honey, it got all the bitches buzzing.
The neck of the barrel is so long and narrow,
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin and munching like Farrel.
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow,
I stay high, but on-point like an arrow.
Street nigga baby Im in love with the gravel,
Money gives me life like the man with the gavel
I'm straped at home, I'm strapped when i travel
I pop my trunk and make the bitches spread like cattle
Chorus
(I got King Kong in the trunk)...and i feed him banana clips,
And he sing like Gladys Knight and the Pips
Im just sticking to the muthafucking manuscript,
Understand im tryin to get the chips and the dip.
Better know i hold that gun with a Panther grip,
My hollow bullets got tips like a dancer bitch.
Where my money? Where my money? You need to answer quick,
Or I'll get back on my ransom shit. (Put him in the trunk)
So you'll be laying ontop of speakers.
Holes all in you like an old pair of sneakers.
Before I do a day, on the edge, I will leap first.
Bet you any money that I will land feet first.
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies,
Riding with Big Foot, Harry, and the Hendersons.
Godzilla, King Kong...and if i have to park,
I will open up my trunk and it wil be Jurassic Park

Got a early call from Kisha
Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then l'm gone be there
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her
Said l needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater
Left Ne-Ne with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cuz I heard she was a freak
They say she ???
But I don't want HIV
?????
Her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said oooohhhh Kisha
This what I got to meet her
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro
Oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep
I got some more meat to feed ya
[Turk]
Now I'm hot
I wonder was up with Kisha tonight
I'm gone give her a call
See if it's alright
For me to dip through
She said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good
I'll be there in a minute
She didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me dippin in but he didn't know ???
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass hoe
Its cool what you do
You know I like my shit sucked
For you to swallow the cum and put ice on my nuts
Call my nut now I'm up
I'm gone holla at ya Kittie
I got through lil tonight me and the H-Beezey
I can't be late
I'm gone see ya when I could
Here's Juve on the hip
Let 'em know it was all good
[Juvenile]
Ooohh Oooh there she go
On the way to the corner store
Lil Turk let me know
We done fucked the same bitch before
Say lil mama where you headed
She told me for Danny
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and now I said fuck it
Say boo I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B.G. on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good and you have it not to telly
[B.G.]
Bitch hold on do I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk I know she ain't got no walls
But she told me she'd do a damn job on them boys
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do to a nigga she'll be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha
Get in the bitch head
End up doing somethin bad ha
Kisha got did right yeah
Fucked the whole Cash Money click all in one night yeah

Im In Da Building Like Da Audience

It's gravy nigga. Believe it.
You hot? Fuck it. Hot as a firecracker.
(It's gravy too.) I got a mac in this bag.
(click clock) What you got? Glock. (Look)
[Baby]
Nigga I'ma tell ya straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag with 20 grams of crack
And I'ma sit in the back seat of yo' 'Lac
Just in case I gotta snap, a firette to the chest
If I don't know shit, I know cars and broads
I done ordered plenty hits and watched heads come off
And I done saw my nigga get life behind them bars
To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream ""fuck 'em all!""
I hustle hard in these city streets
I got my block on fire with my HB's
Spinnin' Benz in these drop tops double r
Cook a brick, flip 'em up, now I got 'em hard
And you can find me
Right up in them hallways, holdin' and totin'
Got the whole motherfuckin block loaded and smokin'
Nigga know one thang: its some uptown shit
If a nigga get it fucked, then we killin' a bitch
[Chorus]
Nigga I'ma tell ya this, straight off the bat
I got a mac in this bag, with 20 grams of crack
Well let's go nigga, see we can slide nigga
Cuz if you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
Look, I'ma tell you this, straight off the top
I got a blunt, and a glock, and a bag of rocks
Let's go nigga, let's slide nigga
If you hot, then I'm hot, let's ride nigga
[Lil Wayne]
Better pay attention now so you don't forget later
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper
Don't make me take ya, play ya
I cock the glock and spray ya
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off
Lock the spot down
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me
[Chorus]
[Lil Wayne]
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
Cuz all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers
I pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere

Alot of niggas better move out
Cause here I come with my click
With the tools out
All of a sudden all these cowards
Startin to spook out
It's warfare a buncha of niggas
Bout to loose out
It's time to load up them thangs
Hit the spot run in his house
And make 'em show up then thangs
Take 'em in the room go in his pockets
And then blow up his brain
No matter the weather
Rain, snow, sleet, or hail
I'ma slang that metal
So tell 'em niggas in yo' hood
To get it together
Cause i'm the tolas mario
And we down for whatever
Nerver underestimate or you goin under
Y'all keep on playin with Lil Wayne
But that lil' boy trouble
And plus this shorty be ?? wodie
Be storin' bundles M start wildin and
Hit the block and let his toys rumble
And it go ratter tatter

When the M-1 shatter
And everybody on they block

[Chorus 2x]
Tell 'em lights off
Mask on
Creep silent

It ain't no time to play
It could be time to die
At any time of the day
And i'll be godammit
If i let a nigga steel me
It will not happen
Ima fire about a hundred and fifty shots at 'em
And got my glocks rabbin'
Leave a nigga spot damaged
That's how the beat made us
I chief three blunts
So I can get a head rush
Then come around the corner
And your whole day crush
I'm sick and tired
Niggas choosin test a boy
They get hit and die
Some of 'em scared of man slaughter
So they stay inside
And watch they partner get lit up
And then they ask why
That's cause you played wit' me
They could'nt of known im'a guerilla
Drama stayed with me
Run in his home went to kill him
Took his head with me
You better get it right or keep it right
Or lose your whole town
Tell em' lights off
It's about to go down
[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3]
Massacire all these streets block it off
Lil' Wayne in yo' hood
With something like a rocket dog
And i'm after ya
I don't pass beef

That boy got a head on his shoulders
I knock it off
I'm highly intoxicated mixing krystelle and vodka
Somebody call the doctor
Cause my chopper done went blocka, knocka
Nigga out the way man
I'm sorry but us guerillas we can't stay tamed, say it man
Are you ready, ready
Ready for warfare Wayne, Turk, Juvi, and BGeezy they all there
We all flare, don't care, dog they all tear
Give the guns to the one with the long hair
And block burner
It gets quiet they see the rims twenty four seventy
(Breathes)they breathe heavlily
Bullets they come steadily
You better stay off the block
Cause you might fall
You better stay off the block
Cause the lights off

Only Cash Money Hot Boy that stood still

I'm from a trill hood
I smoke real good
Slide on them skinnies in the bike with an ill hood
Pipes, rally stripes and fog lights
T-shirt white, three stripes with all ice
What that boy name
Birdman junior, huh
Fool was smile but five is so wild
I can smoke a green mile
Got a chrome need a Rolls shined up for you baby
Bling-blow, I rock a throwback Jordan 23
Rolling on hot 23's
Tote a big glock 23
You're looking at the seventeen ward of New Orleans
My block living me
I want you to look hard at some easy money
Stop playing this is Weezy company
Uh-huh
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I'm the son of Cash Money
The fodd of the squad
And Baby bout to buy me a house in the sky
Cuz I'm so fly
When my feet touch the ground sometimes I gotta ask myself why
Coupe kinda wide but I move sorta quick
Looking for my roof where it went
Mink on the floor big shoes on the bed
Windows are the tint more wood than a bench
Working in the hood more green than the Grinch
Please don't play cuz I'm connected like Sprint
Ladies on the tray popping up the back-end
Peppermint leather with a feather in my brim
It's Lil Weezy
Sucking on my wrist real breezy
And this is what I say when you see me
Look, and leave your broad at home she get took
Cuz I'm a player hold the game by the book
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Some call me Weezy
But hoes holla look at Lil Wayne
In that booger-green lay like should've been Mace
Sweet, do speak when I should've put trays
Forget it I'ma slam it on bubba-bubba-blaze
So move over what you say shortie
We could do rent pussy
Normally I wouldn't but beating through the Texas
And beating went to the A
Eat with desert fey
But yeah I'm on my way
Cuz I know he got that hay
Hey little mami
You a ghetto fire tin
You come to my post on the island
Come on that chronic
He-he empty vodka bottles
I be high he be drunk that my roll model
I rolls by you with my seat reclining
When I stop rims don't keep spinning they keep shining
Money don't stop keep spinning and keep grinding
Cash Money what you hollering, huh

Money aint shit cuz my rottweilers drink moet
Diamond baugette bracelets for my lovers
Playa, i use cristal to lubricate rubbers
Who got shit on his wrist that cost 3 nickel
Who got the project on lock when that nigga slangin pickle
Who got benz, a prowler, playboy, and a Vette
Tell the truth--who fucked ya on the same night when we met?
Now, who got baby mamas from the noila to new york
Who got every bitch attention in this motherfucker when he talk
Now who the fuck we talkin bout, look--yall dont know?
I'll give you a hint: see that bitch you with?
He fucked that hoe

For my prowler, my jag, my benz and my home
Bitch you'll neva ride 20 inch chrome
I love to shine, thats why the choppa is mine
Hit my block in my benz hoe with stretch tires
Bought a new car that I couldnt drive
Ordered the tunes before a nigga could drive
When I put the bose system right behind my eyes
With the vc's and tv's so a nigga could shine
With my ice bling bling like a 9 to 5
And tell all my hoes they dont need no job

Today I Figured Id Sit Down And Talk To You Since Your Old Enough.
You Know Its Time That You Really Realize What This Family Is All About
Cause About This Time Is When Your Gonna Be Able To Join In
And Earn Some Real Money And Real Cash But Before You Do That
I Wanna Teach You A Little Bit About Loyalty,
The Main Name Of This Game Is Respect And Loyalty.
Family Is A Big Thing When We Do This Kind Of Business
Everything Is With Respect And When A Family Member Gets Outta
Line And Another Family Dont Like It One Thing Leads To Another
And The Next Thing You Know, Your Gone And Then Your Just A Memory Of Me,
My Hearts Broke Then, But You Gotta Remember Theres Always Family And Loyalty,
Loyalty Is The Main Thing. Obviously You Know I Dont Make My Money,
I Dont Make All My Cash From Uh Construction Jobs We Do And
Uh Sanitation And Private Stuff Is All Earned Money Through The Family
And Since Your Of Age Now I Think Its Time I
Taught You What Coming Into The Family And Respect Is All About.
So The First Thing You Gotta Learn Is The Name Respect,
Tha Means You Dont Cross Nobody You Dont Go Over The Line,
Once You Go Over That Line Theres No Coming Back Whether
Youre A Member Of The Family Or Not.
Thats When People Get Whacked And We Dont Want Nobody Whacked In Our Family
So I Gotta Teach You The Proper Way Of Respect.
When Youre Earning Money, Everybody Earns, Everybody Eats Bread.
Its All About Cash Money Thats What Its All About Making The Money.
So The First Thing Of Business Is This, You Remember Your Name,
You Dont Forgets Your Roots.
You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Thats Above You Especially Your Capo
Especially The Big Time Guys, Those Are The Guys You Listen To.
You Never Ever Disrespect Anyone Unless Your Told To Unless You Get The Okay.
And If There Is No Sit Down Theres Nothing.

gotta float to the land but don't get it twisted, i still die for me
and do a bid for my man, do the best that i can
cuz i'm strong, strong with a will and a plan
there's a will, there's a way so make way for the fam

and for that reason, i'm gon shoot more than one shot

they like, ""yes master, you da best master""
my hoes need me, i'm like test answers
you don't need me, you might catch cancer
come back from the treatment lookin like van axil
NO, i don't like bald head hoes
i like a long haired diva with the bosses goals
i'm a all day pleaser, your boy can't go
he too proud, i go where your boy can't go, oh
nasty ass lil boy, put my feet up on the dash, pass the grass

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes – I'm drunk and blow
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin’ from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine – it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues
[Lil Wayne]
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
(????) off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy – just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton – mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty – I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
[Lil Wayne]
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip 'cause they breath and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me – everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly – ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

And the homie Street probably somewhere on the beach
And Tez and E probably somewhere in the jeep
And Marl in the Phantom with Mr. G
And ME, ME, it's all about ME
Play with me and it's all our beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!,
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great! Scott!

I, I, I get so deep in that pussy, I touch the back of your soul

And if we on the same track, I hope we crash and explode
Yea, where do the passionate go
I beat it up forever, girl I'll take a national oath
Nobody know what goes on the latch on the door
And if you throw it to me baby, I will catch it and score
Yea, yea
I beat that, I be right when she call me, she got that shit I just can't avoid
She so addictive and she know that I do anything that she tell me
I am her personal sex toy
And then, I pop the bottle of that cris
I had a glass, she had a glass, I had a glass, she had a glass, again
Ya know, then she was ready got to it
One time, two times, hit me up and I take that ass again
And I told her

I see ya walkin like the cameras on ya, I love ya backshots
I'm like a crackhead, and you got your crack out
See, we got chemistry baby, we like cat and mouse
You blow my brains out, I blow ya back out
Now what is that about
You got me sweatin you so hard, I'm bout to pass out
And we could do it on the beach, in the grass house
Say, we could do it on the beach, in my glass house
Uh huh
I know what I'm doin, I'm on it until the mornin
Hop on it until it's foamin, I bone it better than homie
I want it better than homie, come get on this pony
I put my name on it, I own it
That's right
Pin ya to the wall, give ya couple of back bites
Give ya couple of thigh bites, then here comes the highlight
I could make ya act rrright
Take a ten minute break, then get back right
And then I told her
Chorus
Yea, I told her
Ya mama gotta be a model, or somethin
And if you was a wine bottle, I'm drunk
She dance on me like it's just us girl
You could make a nigga pay ya rent for 6 months
Shhhi, I ain't lyin girl
I could make ya little pussy start cryin girl
You won't fire girl
You know the fireman could put out the fire girl
Are those applebottom jeans ya wearin?
She said these is Donna Karen
So tight, she can't even let air in
Man I swear I saw a blind man starin
No lie, and I hope she take her clothes off
So we can do it, 'til we doze off
We fall asleep with our clothes off
When we wake up, we pick up where we left off

Send chills up my trigga finger, blast tha dummy

Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
or dope and powder broke, and our
sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
and z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people, when I get you bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind
[Hook]
[Lil Wayne]
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
[Lil Wayne]
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', ""Stop!""
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than the three of your pigs' last damn house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind
[Hook]
[Lil Wayne]
Tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
[Lil Wayne]
I start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Take seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time
[Hook-4x]
[Lil Wayne]
I tell 'em, ""Whaaat!!""
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine

But im a designated hitter I adjust so fast

I make my hoe stop and let the dough keep movin
A bitch over some money is a hungry nuisance
It Money Over Bitches that im gon keep provin
Yes its Weezy F. I got ya mama groovin

This game is a bitch and im tryna seduce it
I floss a awful lot of haters tryna reduce it
But the laser on the 45 is eyein ya stupid (oh)
One shot to remind ya who is
That fly lil nigga thats behind the trigga (wizzle)

But nigga will never see me like mama tigger (oh)
A 80's baby a fightin nigga
I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga
Im somethin ya culpepper like a viking slick
See me over the viking stove and im whitin bricks
Or in the middle of the shootout untightin clips
Pop another one shoot back while lightin this spliff

You catchin my drift
Representin wit my section on my belly and shit
I am the prince
[Hook]
So roll the carpet out
Cause you fuckin wit a nigga from the royal south
See ya either in or ya out
And if ya out stay in cause them warriors out
Them vultures the cops and them lawyers out
I just open up the gate and let my hoyas out
Nah nigga I never call ya house
Im probably somewhere takin Toya out
Not answerin my phone man ignorin ya spouse
She leavin messages about me enjoyin her mouth (aye)(stop)
Im ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name nah better yet point em out (aye)
Me and the streets got a joint account
Im from the streets that ya need to be warned about
New Orleans woadie put the gat in ya mouth
And we tote a lot of iron that'll flatten ya out
Few roaches but never have no rats in his house
Never tell on one another leave that in the house
Always been a small hustler move my packagin out
I ever run into some trouble send them savages out
These niggas talkin sweet I get them cavaties out
I got graveyard flyers man im passin em out (aye)
Bitch nigga get ya ass on the ground and bow down to ya majesty now

This is my town my home (yea)
This is my crown my throne (the prince)
This is me on my own (the prince)
Let's get it on (the prince)

I'm all, i'm all about my paper, I'm all, i'm all about my paper
[Lil' Wayne:]
Now ho don't ask me what i'm doing, thats me in the hook.
And i just keep on gettin it gettin it like a ni' in the book
Yes, wayne straight like a key of that good sh'
If your bitch don't know the rules, i will read her the book.
I got the key to the boat, i got the key to the jet.
i got the key to success, get money invest.
Read up with the rest. I got a swedish connect.
That means my weed is the best, yoke to even the stress.
Ok, the coupe is ridiculous and the jeep is a mess.
That's called my bullets and lugers, i put 'em deep in your neck.
Adam's apple meet banana clip.
You know my script, i just get my chips and then i dip, and then i dip.
They say the bullshit walks, the money talks.
So I don't answer, I don't answer unless the money talks.
Yeah that's my word, thats my word know i will front for y'all.
Its money over everything and bitches under all. M.O.B!
[Chorus]
[Birdman:]
i say uptown cobblin', uptown rockin', uptown niggas.
it's the home of the hard knocks.
Cook up a whole block. Hit it up in all white.
Ridin' with a chopper, black diamonds and it all nice.
Shop 'till you pop bitch, do your own thing ho.
Got the game from Pixie's, second floor sixth court.
Bling bling king nigga, money ain't a thing nigga.
Ridin' in a lamborghini, suicidal regal wings.
Assault rifles, my little homies big poppers.
Coming through the attic, 20 in the heli-chopper.
Zip it and whip it nigga, that's how we ship it, nigga.
Burn it and light it then we flip it and we hit it, nigga.
I spent a mill on my grill for real.
'Cause we be stuntin while we hustlin, nigga makin his meals.
We be grindin' while we shinin', nigga packin' that steel
Stay fly, get money, nigga stackin' the bills.
[Chorus]
[Birdman:]
I say, we deep in the game, nigga. we switchin the lanes, nigga
Got blood money homie. No pain, no gain, nigga.
Fifty a fame nigga, a G a name, nigga.
That's what we do nigga, claim your fame, nigga.
Hop out a range, nigga. Fang in hand, nigga.
Stop all that reppin', 'fore i... send some flames, nigga.
All this money, nigga. Jewelry and fame, nigga.
'Cause we be stuntin', nigga. Moving them things, nigga.
[Lil' Wayne:]
Paper paper, paper. All i need is paper. Green paper.
White chalk, yellow tape will, make your shirt look like you got on the butcher's aprin.
Go ahead and make the steak then, bitch nigga.
Bitch, nigga talkin'. This is how money sound.
I'm just chillin' but my money still runnin 'round.
Yeah, and I just do's what i does.
You niggas couldn't even be who i was.

Yo, yo, it's like this Dunn
Uh-huh, yo
Sittin back plottin on ways
How we can get this money, we need us a payday
Dig in my pocket, it's nuttin but change
I dig deeper, but still comin up wit change
So we, called our lawyers to fix this shit
He said it's aight, we bout to be _Free Agents_
Have patience, we can't though, we need paper
Like thirty-five million'll straighten us up
It's nuttin for us to make these songs that bump
Shit that out, then tour for like six months but..
This can't be life, this can't be all there is for us
We need more cream to splurge
Thinkin back, how we used to pick herbs
Me and Hav' in Manhattan, stickin up cowards
for they wallets and Starter hats
For anything worth somethin, we beat 'em out of that
But fuck all that, we grown men, we need Porsches
We need Porsche endorsements and more shit
Yeah Dunn, that sound righteous
I feel stressed though -- so I just
hop in my truck for a drive
Bring my nine, cause that's how I stay alive
As I peel in my Jeep, turnin up this
Goin through withdrawal cause man do I miss
A pint of E&J, some haze, a twist
Me and Hav' on a flight to Rome witcho' bitch
Yes, that's my favorite shit
But without the dollars it don't make sense
So I, write that shit that grab you
Hit up the studio, that's how we get paid in full
YEAH - that's what we get paid to do
The next contract we sign'll be monumental
[Havoc]
Uh-huh, yo.. sittin contemplatin on plans
Like a bomb with a short fuse with this gat inside my hand
I need paper, lookin at these stick-up kids
Got me thinkin bout the previous things I did
Gettin bent up, feelin fed up, whattup Dunny
Stomach touchin, niggaz over here type hungry
Waitin on my turn just got me hyper
And impatient, maybe I might just
Lurk with my forty-five, if you outside
I advise yo' ass to hide
We talk with the heat, lettin it spit
Move out the way and you can STILL get hit
They wonder why I'm riskin all this cash I made
Put your feet in my shoes you gon' see it my way..
So niggaz wanna stunt it's cool
My stomach never full, and I will eat your food
[Prodigy]
Aiyyo Hav', check this out
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mines
Cause my girl definitely mad it took us too long to do this album
[Havoc]
Yeah and call Chris Shapiro to make sure they triple that advance man
[Prodigy]
Aight, no doubt, don't forget we got a flight early tomorrow
Gotta be on time
[Havoc]
No doubt, I'ma see you there my nigga
Make sure you remind Noyd, to call Alchemist, and we good

Aiyyo what happened to peace? .. {PEACE!!}

And I might do the spurs sittin on them tim duncan
And in the Lambourgini I do donuts like dunkin
Canary bad bitch with a pussy wanna f**k em'
But I just feed em' girls and watch em' f**k each other
My neck was 100 and my wrist was another
And make her pussy wet I leave that bitch with a puddle
On my beats I'm a dog I should rap wit a muzzle
Peyton manning flow I just go no huddle
Baby girl gettin straight dick no cuddle
You know I'm out this world
I just brought a space shuttle
I'ma put some d's on that bitch
And these hoes starting to get like fleas on my shit
Have you seen her? who? nina she's on my hip
Yellow white diamonds call em' cheese on my grits
You niggas ain't ballin real talk you niggas can't guard me
Two niggas can't gurad me you lookin at jordan
From the side like spike at the garden
I got the hardest bars just call me the wardin haha
Yeah excuse me pardon I break a bitch down like tonya harden
Bitch I'm cole not dude off martin
Pockets just fat like the clumps and norbit
Bitch I'm fly like the magic carpet
And bitch I'm fresh like a pack of orbitz
See I'ma take it back to new orleans
And bitch I'ma shine in the land of darkness
And which I'ma grind till my stacks is as tall as a wall is
And I'm high don't wanna know how deep the fall is
No I can't come down
And everytime I send my girl out of town I put some d's on that bitch
Im a certified gansta haters make me nauseous
And the money makes me anxious
Listen how my words are poet like langston
Dreads down my back like I come straight from kingston
But I come from hollygrove 17 danger zone
So many c notes I can sing a song
T-top coupe lookin like a thong
Gurl on my dick she treats it like a bone
I don't wanna be right if gettin high is wrong
My eyes so low it look like I come from hong kong
Boy I got more green than a bitch with don juan haha
Ok I'm not a rookie I'ma pro
Methasene fiend, make the homies say ho!
And make all the girlies scream
I am a vegetarian and I only eat beats
Wear alot of carrots and I smoke the best greens
No beef in my grocery bag just some swishes
And a whole bunch of cans of whoop ass haha
I'm strapped like a bookbag
So anyone of ya'll can come and get a foot tag
D.o.a ride all night sleep no way
Sleep when I lay six feet deep and until that day
I'ma be living like it is that day
Yeah, I keep holding on, I say bitch I been hot
Bitch the stove been on
If you don't like it I roll over and roll alone
F**k you and the horse you rode in on
Yeah so cool shorts and my kobe's is on
Lookin slicker than the lane that you bowling on
If they didn't tell you I'm the shit
Then they told you wrong
Bitch I'm bubbling like soda foam
In the styrofoam cup
You whats in my styrofoam what
S-y-r up thats my car yup
Vrooommmmmm!! urghhhh!! I'm gone

(Lil Wayne Talking)
I never felt better, Never have, Never will, (Holla)
I mean all I see is money, I got a C-Note between my eyes, (Its Real)
Please feel me, Sqad Up nigga, (For Real)
I'ma dig deep folk, Dig deep dogg, (Its Real)
Now listen, Now what you is?
(Verse 1)
I am what you call a survivor, like trouble with drama
But I recover with power, and love it with honor
Discovered as a son of a problem
Remember smugglin powder throught the doors of my high school
To force up they nostril, 'til it got full
But now they pop for a pill
Lil one here's what's up, Drugs could kill
But drugs could heal
If ya, ahh, ill for that good feel
And it feels good when them fields pull
We wheels quarters through the real raw parts of the streets
My hearts in the streets, So watch what ya step
When ya run from the gunfire of Glocks and Tech's
Specials and Pumps, Vests is for chumps
Eat ya chests for lunch, munch
Young country dude, hunt ya down with tools
Repsect my presence, I step with weapons
You fall in seconds
Its all in the code of the streets, we go by it and stop from it
Real nigga talk, No frontin
Heh
(Chorus)
Do you understand the words that are comin out of my mouth?
If ya dont its because I'm speakin real nigga
Real nigga, This here is real nigga talk
Real nigga talk dogg, I hope you feel me
Let me talk to you dogg, You gotta feel me
I hope you feel me, You gotta feel me
Listen
(Verse 2)
Chrome's hidden inside of my tires
You should see the size of my tires
Ridin' on Mark McGwires, I spark the fire
Got me higher than a late flight
From L.A. to New York twice in the same night
Got some shit in my bag to make ya vein white, Cocaine pipe
Watch homie's brains get rain whipped
Thats the type of sight to make Wayne right
They sayin life is short but money is long, And money is life
So for now I'm runnin the lights, in the 600 with pipes
Hop out, Collar Polo, and under the stripes is something that bites
We will be thuggin for life
And can't nothin pursuede or change us
We gangstas, we live it, I'm in the post without a Pippen
But fuck it, I'm just shootin when I can't move
Who'da knew I can't lose
And truthfully through the loot that's Young Money Entertainment
You get it arranged then holla at me
(Chorus w/ minor variations)
(Verse 3)
I burn in the winter, stand up in the fall
Stand up in the stands, and stand up for my dogs
Them asses I will spall, the plan is too ball
But the stuff I got in my pants cuff
is enough to make'em put my hands on the wall
Work, push on the strip, I'm pushin the whip
Fat back pockets, my cushion if I'm lookin to slip
I'm hookin ya lip, If ya play hookie with my chips
Put that ass kitchen, bitch, when ya cookin that shit
Dodge hoes, jukin and shit
Cause I can see beautiful women, but I'm not lookin for shit
I'm from the hood where you tooken for shit
So you gotta take the shit, and make ya shit
I had to bring home the bacon bits
Cause Pop's was fakin, and he left a nigga bakin shit
Now my heart ache and itch, from all the flagrant shit
I gotta take in, and thug out
Real nigga talk, bitch
(Chorus w/ minor variations)

What?!
What?!!
Look-
Okay, let's cut the crap
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap
I only stick with that 'cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat
I be dipped in black
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out
'cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow
Unlike no other, I'm real (??) like bag 'Bauds
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow
Is that so?
[Hook]
[Lil Wayne]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
If you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die
[Lil Wayne]
Look,
Which one of these niggas playin' with me?
I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease
There has to be some explanation for this insanity
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy (fill in the blank)
Now give me the dank
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank
What's your kid gonna think?
Come home and find your wig in the sink
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys
They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys
Never catch me (??) without them plastic toys
It get drastic, boy
Niggas that's askin' for it
Wheezy, nigga
It's Wheezy, nigga
Who? Wheezy, nigga
It's Wheezy, nigga
[Hook]
[Lil Wayne]
I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all
And if you don't get the hell when he swervin' by
That's your issue - God bless ya - you deserve to die
[Lil Wayne]
I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes
Two pistols, desperado gun busta
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick
'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'
When we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face
Who is Wheezy, nigga?
Who is Wheezy, nigga?
Wheezy, nigga
Lil Wheezy, nigga
[Hook-2x]
[Lil Wayne]
Say, I don't think you realize what's happenin', dog
That lil' boy's 'bout to come 'round here blastin' at y'all

Don't tangle it, nigga

Let these niggas know your (Look!) background, nigga (Look!)
Let 'em (Look!) know your (Look!) background!
Let 'em know how you've been for a while
[Lil' Wayne]
All I was taught was murder murder
Kill drama, and nothin' less
I strap tha Smith-Wess, and bust.. it in they chest
I had ta hustle hustle hustle hustle
Had ta struggle for success
Hid grams in girls' breasts, stick bricks.. under they dress
Them niggas there with me fooli'
Me, I'm full of that dilly
Hope when I catch them slippin'
Him and they daddy's trippin'
Shorty can hold it down
Shorty be totin' rounds
Smellin' like a pound on school grounds
Shorty, wow
Hair... all over my head
Bandana 'round my brain
Eyes bloodshot red
Briches down to my legs
Guns up in my trench
When niggas playin', they get drenched
My pockets is full of lead
So, nigga, stay off tha ben
I'm young with bad nerves
Since I lost my partna, I've been troubled, hurt in this 'burb
So I'on't even hesitate ta leave 'em on tha curb
And wet dem niggas' shirt
Nigga, get 'em full of birds
Tell them niggas, Geezy!
[Chorus, B.G.]
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Took one to tha chest, but Weeze Wee never die
Remember he? Tha little G, never die
Have B.Geezy on his side, so Weezy Wee never die
Lil' Weezy Wee... had ta steal, hustle, and jack
Weezy Wee roll with K's, glocks, and MAC's
Tha little G, he was raised keepin' it real
That's my lil' nigga, I taught him to get it how he live, nigga
[Lil' Wayne]
Look, look
That time I forgot tha bills
Ain't been home in two weeks
Macita lookin' for me
Tha word all over tha streets
Well, shiiit! I love my momma
But all I got ta offer is drama, and many problems
I lay back in tha cut
These niggas out and I rob 'em, they ain't spin around here
We all alone on my block like nobody live 'round here
Tha lights got cut off at my house, and now I'm lookin' for a win-dow
I can't see it, I'ma drop my pile on tha floor
They got some niggas stuntin' in Benz, hey man, them boys ain't riders
{gun cocks} Hand it over, partna, my feet done got tired (Break it off)
Well, picture this, I gotta corner this ole nigga address
He said he got that work, and needed me ta meet 'im there (Meet him there)
Nigga, take your Roly down with somethin' shady, daddy (What?)
Within a week he changed his mind, and... received tha package (What?)
Oh well... back to tha drawin' board (Board)
Cowards start hollerin' 'cause they know I'm comin' for it
[Chorus]
[Lil' Wayne]
Lemme tell 'em
You remember that there nigga use ta be thuggin' it out
Blunt in his mouth, would stay passed up in a drought
Run in your house, ""Lay down! Nobody move!
Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!""
That's how it was... crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs
Lots of thugs... make niggas come ta answer them up
Some niggas choose ta come back to me, ride around my set for me
My lights off that thing 'cause I got that SKS with me
!Okay! (!okay!)
Listen, all you ballin' niggas betta !relocate! (!'locate!)
'Cause, see, ya'll got it
I gotta make my cheese !rotate! (!rotate!)
Right now I'm doin' bad
So just give me with whatever you have, my stomach hurt, I need a bag
I'm street-livin'... week for week
No-sleep livin'
Look outside ya window in tha mornin', your jeep missin'
My heat sizzlin'
I'm ready ta sweep these niggas
Geezy... make 'em remember Weezy, nigga!

Walked with my head down like a stranger, and banged ya
Burnin' off that Hennesy
Some-a ya'll be feminine
Bounce in with a twitch

[Mack 10]
I rock em all, brown rocks to baguettes
I bang and ball, like blood and crypt sets
On Lear Jets, I'm done and dirty and so flossy on tha scene
I'm ridin on dub dueces wit TV screens
And my garge is full of rag tops and candy paints
(Baby:  Tha new Bently out?)
If I don't got it, it ain't
Cause my grind is to shine, I'm as real as they come
And In case you didn't know, I'm tha man where I'm from
Ask em who rock ice on tha west (Baby:  They say Mac)
Ask em who gotta scared wearin vests (Baby:  They say Mac)
Ask em who got like thirty cars (Baby:  They say Mac)
Ask em who got strip, scars, and bars (Baby:  They say Mac)
Man I'ma whole lot richer since tha for life scence
Went countin myself, to a money machine
I'ma get till I can't, wit tha U.P.T.
It's chicken hawk, Whoo-Bangin out tha Dub-S-C
[Hook]
(Mikkey)
Now introducin Mikkey, you could find me crusin tha city
Black X-5, wit four dymes wit me, Y'all feel me
Down wit CMR, so you know my cash is long
Brains, I ain't even gotta ask it's on
Come on, tha ice is blue, the remey is red
Haters turn green, queens wanna give me some head
Still I'm quick to pop two in tha feds
Ya know I been hungry my whole life, so I'm due for some bread
Go head, name another click that could rap above us
A bunch of millionaires walkin wit our gats in public
Cats love it, boosie broads deny it
They step to tha store to buy it, go home and bump it in private
And you know me, I'm low key
Nothin special, just a pinky ring, a Roley, a lil ice on tha bezel
And when I drive by, I can't help doin tha drive-by
Cause my rims be killin haters, every time I ride by
[Hook]
[Christina]
Look, I got shoes, boots, coops wit missin roofs
Chris stackin, even when I'm in tha booth
Got charms and charms, you can call me tha bomb
And you can call me Deep Blow, cause tha smoke under my arm
Got Royces on vogues, countin banks rolls
Even y'all hoes is sendin me roses
I'm nasty and iced up, call me Nicisty
On a bike or in a truck, yeah what you like me
Shoes, bags call me Parda
Haters never mess wit me, don't call me nuda (Ha-Ha)

Brought a Jag for my baby girl, surrounded right
Wit nothin but ice, new whip wit Barda pipes
I could shine when I wanna, buy a ride when I wanna
Cook a brick, cut it up and sell dime if I wanna
Just scored a PT and I streched it quick
Big rims, six tires, candy paintin it slick
Put tha ice on tha shelf until you match my wrist
Golf ball earrings, thirty karats a lick
Got Brian in a mink, got Pearl in a mink
Carivan Excersen, twenty inches look deep
Catch me on tha lake wit a flock of freaks
Me and Mannie tearin it down, cause we love tha streets
Gotta barbecue poppin, bouta cook up tha meat
Fa sho baby girl laced wit ice and mink
[Hook]
[Stone]
I hold it down like and what
Brown and Tan stunnas
Platinum matchin wrists like I broke some handcuffs
Drivin a CL-6
Ridin wit Bear's clique
Tha block done got hot, I'm slingin them raw bricks
We givin them haters trouble
They I was seachin rubber
Lil wodie steady bouncin in a brand new Bubble
Cop rocks like small mountains
Hit blocks wit four ounces
You know you can't stop our watery, we got out own fountain
[Lac]
You can catch me in tha Di-ablo, on chrome wit tha top missin
Tha ring, tha piece, tha chain, and tha watch glistenin
All in a drop Bentley on twenty-two inches
Wit no note, and I sure ain't rent this
Here come Lac and he stuntin, stuntin
Ridin up tha lake on Super Sunday
When I come through I'm tryna jump in somethin
Sound at fifty, and I'm bumpin, bumpin

So move to the left, cause you might catch a hot one
Tear a whole square out ya chest with the shotgun
Make a whole pair out one nigga with the shotgun
We can go there, my nigga, I'm so there
Ridin by myself with the chopper on the backseat
Shoot out the driver side knock his body to the backseat
Stop pause, make the Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggaz when them shorty's go off he
[Chorus]
Lose the handguns, we don't got back nigga
We hold shotguns, we pop that nigga

Make it look like a sun shots
A nice body all dumb hot
He turned cold dead
Anybody in the city cops say did
Look me in my eyes nah look me in my barrel
Leave a barrel strawberry cherry on ya apple
I'm a very scary, new orleans mammal
Shorty on my back got me workin like a camel
Put a hole in ya back and lift you up

Young Money, Cash Money,
This is, Da Drought 3
Ladies and gentlemen, you all know me,
You know I ride for my motherfunkin' niggas,
Most likely I'm gonna die with my finger on the trigger,
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes is so wide as he watching the skillet,
I let my bitch bag it, if she steal it, I'm gonna kill her,
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillas,
And fuck you, hospital, young money, we're the illest,
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest,
My flow is nasty, like C Y Phyllis,
Self made G, and them bitches know the business.
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist,
And when I was 5, my favorite movie was ""The Gremlins""
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention,
You looking for divine and the little intervention,
And them birds don't fly, without my permission,
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes,
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons,
See my world is different,
Like Dwayne Wade,
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing,
And you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
'Cause the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And if you look high, you see that I'm gonna be in it
The sky is the limit,
Buck Ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it,
Switching lane faster than she switch subject,
Tell a bitch don't talk to me,
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free,
And I hate when a nigga say talk is cheap,
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me,
My flow is art, unique,
My flow can part a sea,
The only thing on a mind of a shark, is eat,
By any means, and you're just sardine,
I got the 40 cal. Tuck in my p.r.ps.,
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans,
And majority of my city is violence,
They tried to make a brand new map without us,
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars,
And no matter how you change it, it will still be ours,
And I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'mma die with my finger on the trigger,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
And I'mma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
Cause the sky is the limit,
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or I'll take it off ya shoulder,
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting on the living room sofa,
(that's fucked up, ha ha)
And you don't wanna fuck with a soldier,
Use your head, or ill take it off ya shoulder,
Mail it to your mom, put a dozen of roses, (Now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G,
And you ain't gotta know the alphabet to see,
I know that my whole city is depending on me,
And I forget a lot of shit, but I can not forget the streets,
So you know that I'm gonna ride with my motherfucking niggas,
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
Don't worry bout mine, I'mma grind till I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit,
Because the sky is the limit,
Yeah, the sky is the limit,
And If you look high, you'll see that I'm gonna be in it,
'Cause the sky is the limit,
They tell me don't get high, and I should try to make a living,
I tell them I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
'Cause the sky is the limit,
Hands up in the air, because the sky is the limit,
Can you see me up there? The sky is the limit,
The sky is the limit,
If you don't know nothing about it, the sky is the limit.

Don't let your mouth open up
Cuz you don't wanna see the handgun open up, no
Don't let your mouth open out
Cuz you don't wanna see the automatic open out, no
[Verse 1]
Aint no snitches ridin wit us
Ol mo the mouth niggaz could holla the front
Cant no loose slips get on my yacht
I leave player haters at the dock, watch
And your nigga help ya burn the block
As soon as you get hot nigga turn to cop
Ya settin up federal appointments now
Nigga all in court pointing out
Daddy not knowing what he doin his child
We gon mail him his finger when he get out, yea

Never let shit about G'z leave ya mouth, yea
You inside can't leave ya house
Two donut lovers to police ya house
I sneak past those brothers leak in ya house
And put the heat dead in yo mouth, so shut up
[Hook - repeat 2X]
[Verse 2]
Wizzy nigga been bout me
Stay low so you don't know shit bout me
Make no mistake I'm a veteran at

Get a gat if you ain't got one already
If you do then you ain't got enough get two
And you could never get me nigga get you
And you ain't got to fuck me girl fuck you
I'm rollin wit my goons
And I would never roll on my nigga take that to my tune

Aint no telling who spillin the earl

You go up north nigga's boost they fee up
This where the real hustlers meet up
Look out anybody can be them people
Yo own people could be them people
No glasses can help you see them people
They around too many evil people
Detectives wanna get even equal
My desert eagle ain't even legal, but sssshhhhhhhh
[Hook - repeat 2X]

Yea nigga watch the people around you watch the people away from you
Leave them niggaz be let them stay from you
These niggaz mouth's is runnin like hot water, I swear to God
Real niggaz takin falls like Niagara
Tryna stay up like Viagra, but it ain't gon happen
These niggaz is best buddies wit the 5-0 team they know the DA by name
It ain't a game it used to be one
Its like these niggaz got them big ducks in they mouth that the gynecologist
Use when yo bitch get a pap-smear

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do (that's all I can do mama)
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart (I hope you hear me)
Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to
be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much
but I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up
but everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up
Tellin' me and my clique don't give a fuck
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia
She was my down chick, I was her soldier
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder
You were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!
Chorus
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying, to keep it under control (I see you hidin' it mama)
You got it down, and your well on your way to the top (keep doin' your thing)
but there is something you forgot
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing
I remember the love, right after the fights
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
and if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight
See take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap (what I mean to rap)
Chorus
You've been hiding, (y'know) never letting it show
Always trying (I see you hidin' it mama)
to keep it under control (but I know you know)
You got it down (I know you do)
and your well on your way to the top
(but I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness shawty)
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
and your boyfriend is not like me
Ma you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""Butta"", I called you ""Babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you
and I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me
and let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
and I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream .. DAMN!

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do

Twin clocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, the revenge of the nerds
I swear, play with these niggas that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
You know snitches get stitches nigga needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright fucking right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all yo possessions, call that shit poltergeist
And my homie he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plain Jane cause she catch nut like a flight

Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his

In her throat like the cola, my system solar

Watch that nigga, let's go
Boy my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowing money fast, I'mma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper I'mma smack a nigga
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's telling jokes
I swear to god, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a universe
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm telling you, shot out Turk, it's Hot Boys, bitch the block is hot
If I ain't have the keys to success, I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea shit don't stop until my fucking casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'mma pass the rock

Shell casings
Money put up for jail cases
Bail making

EHHH, until we shove a barrel down ya pipe suckers
Ain't no love for them busta, no pimp for no coward
No respect for no stunt, and no money without power
We keepin niggaz hotter, EWWWW nasty and sour
Pile up in the Eddie Bauer and BLAKA at every hour
Some niggaz like that powder, fold it up what they drain
Some like that weed or that dope and some shoot it up in they veins
From the home of the game, jackin and crackin brains
Broadcastin live from Tha Block it's Lil' Wayne

[Juve:] Nigga you got that llello?
[B.G.:] Well cook something nigga

See where I'm from we keep our guns out
Dodgin cops and burnin blocks, cause we be thugged out
It's time to floss, two big bodies on Broad South
and they got quarter staffs and birds that run the house
It's all good in the hood hustlin like illegal
Soon as you get it, hot SKIRT, like for them people
Break up the block and hit the cut by the corner sto'
End up in Miss Taylor backyard, be quiet, she on the porch
This everyday, at the spot where niggaz murder on top, boy
It's the spot where they got Fire Girls and Hot, Boys
We don't know what be goin cause we so blunted from trees
and we'll be round ya all day til it's ""400 Degreez""
And you see where niggaz go, nobody be on the pulpit
They got a nigga that own the sto', he flippin out off that broad
Betta stay in yo' car, and make sure, your door is locked
Cause this ain't nuttin proper, cause Tha Block, is jusssst Hot
[Chorus]
[Lil' Wayne]
See watch your step on my section, gotta walk like, talk like
Where they shot out all the street lights
So you can't see what nobody be like
And we like, to dress in all black up in my residence
Ain't got on no suits, cause we ain't tryin to be presidents
And ever since the coke drought, niggaz been on a trip y'all
So you better watch what y'all playin wit
Cause a nigga will try to flip y'all
They hit y'all, jam you up and put a gun to your jug
Hahhhh, catch your breath, now shhhhh, catch a slug
It's street smarts, plenty niggaz that keep spots
When the heat starts, ain't nobody got sweethearts
Callin weak shots, you could come try to cheap talk
We cut your week short, them lil' boys don't give a damn
Call out for that caper, won't hesitate to kill a man
Run in his house and kidnap the nigga, him and his fam
Tie em up put em in the vans, then put a gat in his drawers
... tch, one move blow his cactuses off
[Chorus]

WHOOT! Some people call me cause Tha Block is Hot

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet (Huh?)
They don't even much understand this (Uh-uh)
Look-
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes - I'm drunk and blow
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
(??) from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine - it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice
[Hook (Lil Wayne)]
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues
[Lil Wayne]
Look-
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
(????) off the meters
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy - just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton - mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty - I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!
[Hook (Lil Wayne)]
[Lil Wayne]
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cop
And niggas be like Q-tip 'cause they breathin' stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's (??)
Until I die I pullin' ego that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me - everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly - ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house

Dressed in all black and my gun the same color
Murder my enemy love thy brotha

Hit him up and watch the guts come up out a younga stomach
You niggaz better take side with young money, Cash Money
You'll get left in your ride crash dummy

When the wheels fall off and the tires stop running
The magazine empty and the nine stop busting
I bang my fist till my palms get bloody
Cuz I'm a monsta man
I'm gonna find you in my AP nine on jam
I'm a rider you can't take it out of me man

Say Bang! Bang! say breathe deep breath I stand ova the body with the boy in his chest...Clear!

And them niggaz that push me
Ain't nut but pure pussy
Sure honey I done heard what you said
But if a nigga really cared
You'd already be dead
Just some young ass niggaz
With some old ass bread

Just lost my father last year
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone
Rather come home, why ya left us all alone?
But I'm comin man
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be runnin man
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love
You watched me come up from a scrub
Now ya see ya son ridin everyday on dubs
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you
It got me pissed, this family and my momma, too
But please brah, won't ya come back for Lil Wayne
And see ???, Mrs. Roe, Sheryl, Kemp and plus Sinetra
Dawg, we really miss ya
And it ain't all that cool livin off pictures
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me
Can't believe you left me to be a small man
But I know it wasn't meant to be
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me
[Hook 2x]
It's up to you, Wayne, nigga, stay up and keep it real
It's all on you, man, my nigga, I know how you feel
Just be strong, 'cause everythang gon' be alright
I know it's hard tryna make but it's gon' be alright
Alright I know it, see I got a child
I know I'm young, but when you left dawg, thangs got wild
I know you probably sayin 'damn, you raisin children now?'
But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin millions now
So I still smile
I'm takin care ya wife brah
Ain't nothin changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'
Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though
So you know who payin the bills now, ah hah
Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah
I got all my game from you, man I ain't gon' lie
But I'm still thuggin nigga, playa you think I ain't gon' ride?
But Slim and B done slowed me done and brought the talent out me
Yeah Slim and B done showed me 'round, all a the Jags around me
And I ain't goin' no where, that nigga stuck wit' me
And make you and my people happy, man it's up to me
[Hook]
I know you know I'm thinkin' 'bout ya, you be on my mind
I know ya see me everytime watchin the boys shine
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD
And picture this, your little boy even on TV
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me
[Hook 3x]
I mean it's up to me man
Just watch over me
And it's gon' be all gravy man
Leavin big, treatin me all good
Everythang else be all good
Rest in peace ya heard me
I'll be there

Man... ya'll niggas ain't up for this!!

Now let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins,
Hit the mall with my girlfriends, dish out ends.
Cause you know it ain't trickin' if you got it,
Cop baby girl what she desire, it's chump change mama.
Marijuana Scholar... Knowin' what I got up in my styrofoam cup?
That purple stuff. It was givin' to me at birth to stunt.
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the fur in the guts.
[BABY of Big Tymers] (Ay, Ay, Ay..)
Hold on, mami! Them whips on dubs.
Cadillac truck, twenty-eights, no rubs.
Slide in the Benz, fins, bubble-eye lens,
Car show in New York, Ya'll know who wins!
It's the birdman, daddy, with the Gucci and Prada,
Slant-back, cut truck. No rims? Can't holla.
It's that Louie/Fendi on Ostrich streets,
It's the tailer-made daddy, Mami, do you love me?

In that Cadillac truck on them twenty-three's.

All these naked women that pop champagne.
And these marble floors stay high as Rick James,
If you know my name, then you know my game.

It's lil' whodi from the hot block with ser'ous flow,
Gotta get dough, cause ya'll won't feel me, bro.
But ya'll don't here me tho...
Till I'm rollin' down my window and my grill-ie show.
And you know I'm prolly pumpin' through the hood on the twenty-fo's,

Glock have ya ribs pokin' out the side of ya shirt.
I'm a seventeenth nigga and I ride for the turf. Whoo!

I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch aint got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But i'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap

Uh Yea, Oh Yea
Trin' Bein I've Got Ya
Yea I'm On That Syzurp my
Ya Off Tha HOOK
Hey! Heyyy!
Go by the name of Weezie F.
AnD, I'M WALKING out the belly store with ten bags?
Fly as a mutha fucka girly on my staple
Cause her friends say I’m a tummy sucker
Don't go below the navel
I'm up in Lil Hatti
I'm blowin on Jamaica
I'm in the pimp a beemer
I'm with a salt shaker
Now I'm in DADE County
I see some thick bitches
I try to holla at em
But they all trick bitches
I think Trina sexy
MamI ya wine fine
And on the hush hush
We need some quiet time
Yea I'm a RIDE ma
The Birdman's boy
He OWNS CA$H MONEY
I PRE-OWN CA$H MONEY?
Yea and I put her on CA$H MONEY
She start wobblin that ass for me
She start modelin
She see the models in the Maybach
She call me Weezie F. Baby
And she make sure she say that
[Chorus]
[Lil’ Wayne]
See a fly nigga baby yea I don’t trip
Just give em lil THIGH
Mama give em lil hip
[Trina]
And if you see a fly bitch
nigga holla don’t trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
[Lil’ Wayne]
Give em lil THIGH
Mama give em lil hip
Then you give em Lil’ WIND-UP
Give em a lil DIP
[Trina]
And if you see a fly bitch
Nigga holla don’t trip
Break her off a few dollars
Take her on a few trips
Now I’m the daughter of a madam
Inside of a pink phantom
If ya man got that cash
Then best believe I met him
Cause I’m sharp as a machete
And I cuss like CRAZY
Niggas call me Betty Crocker
Cause my cakes stay plenty
Got stacks on top of stacks
I'M COPPIN' A MEAL TICKET
No matter the consequence
My emphasis is to get it
It’s Trina Weezie F. Baby
MANNY HANDLE the scripts
It’s all reminiscent to
Gladys KNIGHT AND the PIPS
All my niggas jump around
Girls jump on that dick
It aint gonna be no standin around
Now lets get crunk in this bitch
And ladies
Show em yo shit
A lil hip a lil THIGH
More pressure for the eye
And the more a nigga try
You can find me stretched out
In my 850i
Or my big 600
Believe Trina done it
Believe I'M diamond studded
Stay flooded like a damn
Chase GRANDS cause I am what I am
Don’t give a damn
Go
[Chorus]
Back to the lesson at hand
Stick to my plan
When it comes to seein man after man
Don’t give a damn about his car or his GRANDS
Wh Wh WhWhat
Cause I’m gonna make my on ends
That’s WhWhat’s up
Ladies lets say you want a man
But don’t kno how to do it
Dirty dance with em
Put a lil back into it
GO CATCH A wall shorty
End up at the mall sporty
Try to dog waddy?
Make em spend it all on ya
Yep and make that nigga ball for ya
Then have him beggin for that kitty kat
Wining and dining for that ass
Give him none of that
Just let him know
Say make a bitch rich
Cause the badest bitch taught you that
[Chorus]
[Beat Till End]

Look look look - don't play with me
Look look look
Huh? Huh? Look
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get it - it's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family

Don't play with me - I wish you would
I'ma hit your hood, then split your hood
You bet' not play with me cause I cock my gun

And I pop my gun
Better hide and run

What is this that done got me in your district? Twist it
Now everybody got dots on they heads like Egyptians
I'm tipsy - I've been sippin' on that Hennessy, people
Then it get deeper, I start shootin' up innocent people
Seventeen creeper is who I - what I - be, dog
The clip slide in the four-five, then it blow five
In heat, dog? It's your life or me, dog
On four tires, or feet, dog
I still be on the block sweepin'
Nobody is not sleepin'
Got me in all black with a gun in a palm
Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's on - ain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff
cause when I come through mashin' the truck, I'm blastin' a pump
and passin' a blunt - me circle, wants to see if he dead
Gotta be sure cause niggas promised me a ki if he dead
But, dog, you get it raw if you are with the kid
I'll push your baby momma car off the bridge
Huh?!

You might catch me with bandanas and strapped T
On the back street of your block in the back seat
I'ma cap three at the first coward I up and see
I'ma bust the piece and knock his body a couple of feet
When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played tough - wouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed - add it up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip
I know you see me: Little Wheezy killaholeezy
A hundred rounds from the chopper leave 'em real sleepy
You know how we be smellin' weedy up in our clothes
Cutthroatin', connivin' killers, but that's all I know
Huh? Huh? Huh?

Brave hard bitch like the times Im medieval
Married to the block, Divorce the Cathedral
Standin on the corner selling Porcelean to People
Forced into evil, Its all in your head
It's also cerebral, call me Canival
You follow when i lead you
Straight to the needle
The barrel, the battle, the beetles will eat you
Mama named Cita, I love You Cita
Member when your pussy Second husband used to beat ya
Remember when i went into the kitchen got the cleever
He aint give a f**k i aint give a f**k neither

Tagged up brick walls
Fliip grams, quick hands, Quicksand Pitfalls
Big Balls intact, through error Syntac's
That Stormy Whether where the Trees dont bend back
Left home at 16
I aint never been back
When it come to being broke i say i never been flat
I punk ass bitch i aint never been that
Reminisce how Daddy cuaghta ""slitch"" in his lap
IN his newport box with only one stick left
Snort heroin then he'd shove me in the chest
Used to really believe, I never be the best
Hell must be on my shoulders Cuz the devil seent the rest
Right on it through his binge's and
Then poisinous Syringe's
Beaten on my mama kicked the doors of the hinges
I wish i was old enough to stop him when he did it
So long agao but even I cant forget it
So listen

Tryna find the change, Shining lightining like im in heaven
Triple seven, Triple Six
Trebulations, Triple trip
Triple grip, triple spitiin' like a had a trple lip
Lets make simple sense of the main difference
Angel if Death's Wing gotta s sinner in a Clench
Revolver in my fist, Earthworm to a fish
Bait on the line watch me cath them with this
Hope flound compound off round White rock
Ballin like Earl man i go in his high tops
Third eye cyclops, beaten down by five cops
Left for dead and it aint even my block
Think of my pops, thinkin of my moms
Rather be just blazin listenin to Saigon
Cuz when u think up, God strikes you down
Body full of current lightenining never hit the ground

He he hee
I'm a young playa nigga, (what)
I get the game from the big tymers, nigga (what, what)
Who else? (Speak on it) On the real nigga, on the real nigga
Respect the game
Cuz I got the game
[Lil Wayne]
Y'all know who I is
Weezy coming thru in the bubble eye Benz
See me front in back with the wood all around
Plus I got that *boom boom* surround sound
Don't hate on me boy if you do *pow* get down
Come from under my shirt try to lift you off the ground
But on the other hand, I'ma keep running man
I got about a hundred coming up with three Hummers man
We stuntas man
I might stumble across a grand and give it to you wifey
And watch how she *slurp* on my pipey like a Icee
I might be in a Range that night
I might be in a Lex watching the game tonight
I got a hundred on Kobe, hope he playing it right
But if I lose, its cool, that's some change lil shite
That ain't nothing
I ain't doing nothing if I, I ain't stunting
Hold up, girl be quiet, Lil Wayne coming.
[Baby]
Slow yo roll lil one
You ain't glad its bought
And Ms. Pat and gray head over there
In the back card gambling
At the bar dranking
But go head, just be quiet with ?em lil one
[Lil Wayne]
Broads I use ?em
Hatas I bluse ?em
My whole front grill is full of confusion
Got dammit
Weezy pull up in a Porsche, expanded (expanded)
I was to the back, niggas couldn't stand it
Soon as I left the scene, the women vanished
I got it like that
Got Rolex, blue shit hard to say watches
Plus I bought all of my niggas Cartier watches
Weezy and his clique leave with forty b-e-atches
Million dolla man baby tear da beasy
Catch me sippin on some Hen, maybe Covoursier
Sammy, Mario, tody Taz, that's my posse
And what
You might see me dippin low in a Benz truck
Tell yo girl hello
I done did her, what you muggin me for
Keep playin with me, I'll put a slug in yo do
[Mannie]
Now looky here, young blood
Pull yo pants up on yo ass and put that piece of metal up in yo shirt
Don't make me get up out this wheel chair and kick yo ass
Now keep doing what you doing
Go head
Y'all know me, young playa, stomp with the big dogs
Play with me boy I give you cancer like menthol
Cough cough cough up
Got a cat eye benz on brollas
They call us
Uptown shiners
Original hot boy$ baby, big tymers
I spit game
Get in they head, they be like, ?Quit Wayne!?
Half hour later, I'm in they split man
Hehehehe it be kicks man
Let me get real
I'll kill on the battlefield
Steal for the scrill
I will never leave my clique nigga, I'm to trill
I'm a little peepsqueal
But I'm a ape in that jungle
And if you get it twisted,
Nigga, I'm taking yo lover
I mean I'm raping yo lover
Leave her taste in my rubber
I'm a playa nigga, I'm a playa

I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didnt come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
and then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix...laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me (What?)
My love, my patience, my pain (OK)
Nigga please
[Chorus]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
[Verse One]
I met her after the fame
And she aint even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good...I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life...the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit (Shit)
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep it..she aint want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody
[Chorus]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
[Verse Two]
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggaz love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back
[Chorus]
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)
I got the young'n blues y'all (da-da-da-da-da)

[Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alieses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
""Al B. Sure"" nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincoln's and Aurora's, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls alot of flirtin' involved but dog..
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
(Drive slow)
You never know, homie
About these hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do?
I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin
The candy gloss is immaculate, its simply amazing
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catches boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy-coated crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby, what it do
[Chorus: Kanye West (GLC)]
Drive slow, homie
(Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes)
Drive slow, homie
(If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go)
Drive slow, homie
(Live today, cause tomorrow man, you never know)
You never know, homie
Might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got mo TV's in here than where I live
[GLC]
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I wearin my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canary's is gleamin', through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow [echoes]
[Tony Williams harmony ad-libs]
[T.I.]
Lookin' at the life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen alot clearer after time had passed
Known for livin' so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, he constantly mashin'
(Why don't he slow down?) They be constantly askin'
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't tryna say that it's the way of the masses
But it, so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and Sigel cuttin' classes, showin' our ass
Shootin' out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
A shame I ain't playin' with you shorty, I ain't braggin'
Me and Cap got life, some other folk got blasted
Had a partner OD'd and after this all happened
It's like the only thing that kept a pimp from cryin' and laughin'
And the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'd make it this far rappin'
For introducin' the youth to what we now call trappin'
Considered now a classic, who'da imagined?
Me in Milano, gettin' models in next year's fashions
So nowadays, they can call me old fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is
Life about who make it now not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie
Dri, uh dri slowly

You just popped in the Kanye West
Get right for the summer workout tape
And ladies if you follow these instructions exactly
you might bear to pull you a rapper, a NBA player
Man, at least a dude wit' a car
So first of all we gon' work on the stomach
Nobody wants a little tight ass!
[Verse 1]
1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and get them sit ups right and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give head, stop breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and my dick
What's scary to me is Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night I came..
I came...
I came..
[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out
then maybe we can work it out
Work it out (Come on) [4x]
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)
[Verse 2]
Oh girl your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set Twista said get it wet
Ooh girl your breath is HARSH
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks yea I bought them cars
Still killa a nigga on 16 bars
We ain't sweatin' to the oldies we jukin to a cold beat
Maybe one day girl we can bone
so you can brag to all your homies now
But I still mess with a big girl if you ain't fit girl I'll hit girl
1 and you brought 2 friends OK 3 more now hop in the Benz
Four door do you know the difference between a 5, 6, 7, 8
All the mocha lattes you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in before you start back dating
Hustlers, gangstas, all us, ballas
[Chorus]
It's been a week without me
and she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
'Lest, she talkin' about freakin' out

Work it out (Come on) [4x]
Work it out now
Maybe we can work it out (Come on, come on)

See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay

Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies

What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to ""Let it Burn""
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin over babysitters like, ""Bitch - it's yo' turn!""
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official

With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long

No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag
Dag, niggaz still doin puff puff pass
Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)
Then I see how y'all gonna react when I'm (gone)
My last girl want me back then I'm on
Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that?
Cause

Uhh, uhh, yo, yo
I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

Uh-uh-uh uh uh onnn, uh uh-uh onnn
Uh-uh onnn, uh uh-uh I'mmmm
Ah-head of my time, sometimes years out
So the powers that be won't let me get my ideas out
And that make me wanna get my advance out
And move to Oklahoma and just live at my Aunt's house
Yeah, I romance the thought of leavin it all behind
Kanye step away from the lime-
-light, like, when I was on the grind
In the ""One, Nine, Nine, Nine""
Before, model chicks was bendin over or
Dealerships asked me Benz or Rover, man
If I could just get one beat on Hova
We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston
Hold on I'll handle it, don't start panickin, stay calm
Shorty's at the door cause they need more
Inspiration for they life, they souls, and they songs
They said sorry Mr. West is gone!

[Kanye (Female Voice)]
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good?
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
What's your addiction? Is it money? Is it girls? Is it weed?
I've been afflicted by not one, not two, but all three
She's got the same thing, about me, but more, about us
She's coming over, so I guess, that means, I'm on drugs
Just let me peek now, I mean damn, I'm so curious
She's got a lover, so the lies, and the lust, is a rush
Time's of the essence, I need, you to be, spontaneous
Roll up the doge, and he ain't cu-cut the quarter, then I'm co coming over
Cuz its ne-never over
[Chorus]
[Kanye (Female Voice)]
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But (You make me smile)
I see the emotion in your eyes, that you, try not to show
We get the closest when you high, or you drunk, or you blow
So I pour the potion, so we could both get high, as we could go
Then I'll get the lotion, and do something to me, when your thighs is exposed
There's no turning back now, I mean I don't mean to impose
Not now but right now, I need you to undress, and then pose
I'm into that now, catch a vibe, when the doors, get closed
Roll up the doge, and he ain't cu-cut the quarter, and I keep co coming over
Cuz its ne-never over
[Chorus]
[Female Voice (Female Voice)]
Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good
Everything they told me not to is exactly what I would
Man I tried to stop man I tried the best I could
But... (You Make Me Smile)

Why everything that's supposed to bad make me feel so good

But... (You make me smile, With my heart)
I just wanted to ask you
Just wanted to um
Let how would I put this uhh
Let's say all your friends
Remember the one
You said if you ever she would be the one
Ok, Ok, Ok (You make me smile with my heart)
I was thinking, hypothetically
I mean don't take this seriously
Don't take me: I mean just
Uhh not credibly
I'm feeling incredibly
I mean let's see
Just maybe
I mean you are in me (You make me smile with my heart)
Maybe, Baby, Baby
You know I was just kidding
Unless you gon' do it

Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm telling you ohh, it all falls down
[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs aint picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexus (a Lexus)
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and well
[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]
[Verse - Kanye West]
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like nigga you ain't up on this!
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop/coupe
[Chorus - repeat 2x (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]
[Verse - Kanye West]
I say fuck the police, thats how I treat em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes when we don't really need em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
Cause they make us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shortys hollering ""where the ballas' at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordans, crackhead buy crack
And a white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon act holier than thou
Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
Cause I wanna be on 106 and Park pushing a Benz
I wanna act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spending before I get it
We all self conscious I'm just the first to admit it
[Chorus - to fade (w/ Kanye ad-libs)]

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For just to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire)
Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can that huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne to the....
Chi-Town what's going on man
[Verse 1]
I drink a boost for breakfast, an intro for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzurp
Not to worry the Mr. H says that the izzles back wizzerk
How can you console my mom or give her life support
When you telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Ed Mitill
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them Donahue signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to resign
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where BIG and Tupac died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't your nigga man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here is history in the making man
I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah
[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the shadow was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep my safe book safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
All they heard was in accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um.. I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man

My raps is better than yours
My plaques is better than yours
My tracks is better than yours
You can have one but I have to charge
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
Then I will have the Kwam uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black car
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
(Hook)
La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me
Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle don't know you don't discuss you
Every rapper want to know when they can get to work
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
Everybody ripping my style like the shit that hurts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
There's something I might say There's something I might play
A beat I might made might make they life change
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill You could be Lauren Hill
See y'all write songs to keep the lights on
I'ma go in Def Jam and turn the brights on
Man I'm just sayin
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Now you just prayin
(Hook)
[Common]
You was a vic in high school now you a thug
Better step in the name of love
Before you giving pain a hug
Needing dope is like pain to drugs
Or aiming slugs til the game unplugged
Like a scoreboard with vice and warlords
Hot merchandise prices they want more for it
You was pink as ice single need to think it twice
Over the bitch and you came out like freaks in the night
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
I'm on point like I speak to dice
Took the underground at a steeper heights
May real niggaz see the light got fat girls eating right
Ha ha we in this bitch
It's Common and Kanye y'all niggaz know what time it is
Chi-Town motherfuckers DJ Ferris Heavy Hitters What Up?
Mike Love What Up? DJ Enuff
Foreal(Pharrell) That's my favorite producer by the way

Now if you was my girlfriend you don't need no guyfriend
He could get his head bust nigga ain't my friend
Why the hell you lying who the hell you trying
Who the hell you know that threw away his throwbacks
When they suggested they was made by Majestic
My answers cost three-hundred-fifty ya naw mean
Doesn't even have got her number we ain't on the same team
You got the hat the jacket shoelaces to match
I got the gat ratching new cases to catch
I got my business manager erasing my debt
I mean my credit was so pathetic I couldn't get a debit
I fill out for a car but shit they always debt it
My girl come over try to help me shine
How you gonna help me get a car your credit worser than mine
But everytime I get a check you be first up in line
Told you bout gold-diggin bitch it's worser than lying
You better grow up before I blow up
Have weed rolled up when I show up
Matter fact we broke as fuck
Ain't nothing left to do except get tore up from the floor up
Shit that's how I knew you was my girlfriend
So I promise to never pick up smutts
In my Cadillac pick-up truck
They need to get they sit-ups up
They always be colder than you
A little richer a little thicker a litter older than you
Probably a little smarter so they can drop me some jewels
That I could drop back to you to get your ass back in college
So you can be where they at two years from now
But for now bartender two beers for now
The second one is for my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend
I'm talkin bout when we was in Nissan's no Benz or such
We wasn't from Switzerland but we'll still go Dutch
Greater man could prob picture like there go us
No styles just good times like they're so nuts
We always thought if we had dough we could do so much
Like you ain't got to save the roach we can finish the Dutch
Like we ain't have to go coach told you i'll be paid soon
We ain't got to sit in this emergency aisle just to get leg room
We ain't got to go back to my room there's only one bedroom
That I call my lair
We was V.I.P. Very Imaginary Playaz
But you was my girlfriend yea yea yea you was my girlfriend
[Jay-Z] Holla, All I need in this world of sin is me and my girlfriend me and my girlfriend
[B.K.] Down to ride til the very end is me and my boyfriend me and my boyfriend

It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, each rapper's the pioneers
What would it take to be a legend like Nas is?
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a 'lil snobbish
I did a 'lil bit of College
Semesters it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this was in my place
The beat's slow, 'til you listen to my pace
'Cause I be killin' shit, but that's evident
And y'all feelin' it, but I expected

To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum? Yeah, that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like
Your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it
The car ain't imported
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firin', in my environment
Leavin' you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doin' wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to.. yea

Me - I got no jewels on my neck
Why? - I don't need 'em, I got your respect
KRS-One, 20 years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we is a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station?
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at?, c'mon where you at?
This is the difference between emceein' and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that're mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun

Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album comin' out
Askin' teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of Classic is?
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerge in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubtin' the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosignin', even the non-believers
Since I came in the door, and became one of y'all leaders
In a fresh pair Air Force sneakers

Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
Have no fear that they might
Desert me
[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid,
Seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived, cuz
It take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe does
he write his own rhymes, so sort of
I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than u ever thought up
Damn, is he really that caught up?
I ask if you talkin' bout classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort or even a four-track recorder
so its only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
- its for yourself that's important
If a stripper named Porscha and u get tips from many men
Then your fat friend her nickname is Minivan
Excuse me,
That's just the Henny, man, I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop I can't because
[Chorus]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

I was sick about awards
Couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense to them
30 minutes later seems there's no convincing them
What more can you ask for?
The international awards? nah
Who complains about when he is old?
And throw a tantrum like he is 3 years old
You gotta love it though somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change, or the game, or the fame,
When he came, in the game, he made his own name
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
Its Kanye - But some of my plaques - they still say Kayne
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi - them folks ain't from Motown
Life movin' too fast I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, ya need to go down
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
My father Ben said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my ceaser
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you can call you gotta best believe it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yea the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like ""pssh we messed up""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle till we got messed up
In the studio, where really though, yea he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question dog ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man, are y'all ok man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-right here stands a-man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands...
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme.
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?......
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)

Good Morning, this ain't Vietnam still
people lose hands, legs, arms for real
little was known of Sierra Leone
and how it connect to the diamonds we own
when I speak of Diamonds in this song
I ain't talkin bout the ones that be glown
I'm talkin bout Rocafella, my home, my chain
these ain't conflict diamonds,is they Jacob? don't lie to me mayne
see, a part of me sayin' keep shinin',
how? when I know of the blood diamonds
though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
over here, its a drug trade, we die from drugs
over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
the diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus Piece was so harmless
'til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
and here's the conflict
it's in a black person's soul to rock that gold
spend ya whole life tryna get that ice
on a polar rugby it look so nice
how could somethin' so wrong make me feel so right, right?
'fore I beat myself up like Ike
you could still throw ya Rocafella diamond tonight, 'cause

the pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack? [laughs]
part of me I had to laugh at that
how could you falter when you're the rock of gibralter
I had to get of the boat so I could walk on water
this ain't no tour order, this is nothin to me
difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep,
I sell Kilos of coke, (so?) I'm guessin' I can sell CD's
I'm not a buisness man I'm a buisness, man
let me handle my buisness, damn!

as long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
and even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
so he can just kick back and chill somewhere, oh yeah
he don't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey was in the rear sayin exactly
what I was sayin practically me whole carreer
the diamond is forever, I been mindin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
people lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
instead we rose from the ash like a phoenix
if you watin for the end, the dynasty signed
and what seemed like forever is a mighty long time
I'm young bitches [laughs]
Goodnight!

""They won't leave in the night, have no fear that they might""
[Chorus]
""Diamonds are forever, forever, forever""
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
""Diamonds are forever, forever, forever""
The Roc is still alive everytime I rhyme
""Forever...""
Forever eva, forever eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva
[Verse 1]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through East St. Laurent glasses
And I realise that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my vibe, does
He write his own rhymes, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgat better shit than you ever thought of
Damn, is he really that caught up
I ask, if you talk about clasics do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So its only right that I let the top drop on a drop top Porche
It's spoilin' yourself thats important
If you striper name Porcha and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is mini-van
Excuse me, that's just the Henni, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only player that got robbed and kept all his jewlery
Alicia Keys tried talk some sense in him
Thrity minutes later saw his note convincin' him
What mo' could you ask fo'
The international asshole
Who complained about what he is owed
And throw a tantrem like he is three years old
You gotta love it though
Somebody still speak from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game he made his own lane
Now all I need is ya'll to pronounce my name
Is Kanye but some of my plaques still say Kayne
Got family in the ?D-King?, folks from Mo Town
Back in Chi, them folks ain't from ?Mo Town?
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, she need to go down
My father Ben said I need Jesus, so he took me to church
And let the water let the water run over my ?sleezer?
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then my body got steel, like a paraplegic
You know who you call, you got a message to leave it
The Roc stand tall, and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Ya, the beat cold but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust gets swept off
Big K kick it where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I drop my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&Rs lookin like phhttt we messed up
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'till we got messed up
In the studio, we really though, ya he next up
People askin' me is I gon'give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question all yo, where Dame at?
He's tracked the Indian dance to bring our rain back
What's up with you and Jay, man? Are ya'll okay, man?
They pray for the death of our dynasty like Amen
R-r-r-r-right here stand a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Chorus]
""Diamonds are forever, forever, forever""
""Diamonds are forever, forever, forever""
""Forever...""

They gossipin, it runs the city, they don't know who watchin them
When they comin to get me, so I hit the block and bend
Do about 60, and I put my glocks to them, like blaow blaow blaow
[Verse 1]
Im fittin to get on this TV and put shit down
I aint finna let these lights skinned niggaz come back in style
Im finna turn to this class clown, should be crazy deep
They told my momma I was bipolar had A.D.D.
I told em, w-what I wanna do, I wanna be a baller
The dream spoilers are for ya
Hatin on you to they mans on the corners
Old folks said he'd never make it off the corner
They are the virus that corrupts the soul
They are the cubic zirconia inside the 10 karat gold
That get green on ya, when you get green on em
You gotta wash ya hands of em, get clean on em
Somebody told success is the best revenge
So they gon be fucked up when you do ya thing on em
Now hold ya plaques high, like who woulda thought
And tell em, eh-hem, thank you for your no support
[Chorus 2]
They are the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers
Who know a dream, they are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
They the dreamkillers, they the dreamkillers, dream
They are the dream (killer Norman Bates)
[Verse 2]
Now how you gonna talk about the way I spend my money
Everybody say it with me now, it's my money
And they know they hatin, but what they don't know is
They are my motivation, they are my inspiration
Cuz we the leaders, and they the followers
And we the nut busters, and they the swallowers
They are the rumors, they are the lies
We are the shit dog, and they the flies
How you gon tell me how to live my life
And you can't even get your own shit tight, right
They are the misery that loves company
Cuz that comfortable corporate job can't comfort me
Told em I finished school, and I started my own business
They said ?Oh you graduated?? No I decided I was finished
Chasin yall dreams and what you got planned
Now I spit it so hot you got tanned
And they hate on your relationship, then break your marriage up
Can't kill ya dreams so they assassinate your character
Do anything to downplay ya or embarrass ya
Come around wit ya but they aint down wit ya
They the dreamkillers
[Verse 3]
And I'm through spittin these rappers my most heartfelt flow
They be like ?That's cool, you got some beats for me tho?
Oh I get it, you wanna be Snoop and Dr. Dre
But don't nobody give a FUCK what you got to say
Anyway what you finna rap about?
You never sold crack out ya house or put a gat to a mouth
Or put ya fist to ya spouse, so how you gon move the crowd?
I bet a thousand that you get booed out
I even heard that they even takin wages in jail
They bet ten boxes of cigarettes that I'm finna fail
Second you talk about me, they be like ?Peace?
This nigga came from the Chi, moved to the east
You gotta kill at least one person at least
Or we'll evict you from the rap game, cancel your lease
How you go to New York, what you aint never took a tour there?
What you aint know you gotta be rich just to be poor there?
The dreamkillers

[Kanye West]
My homie Mali used to stay, 79th and May
One of my best friends from back in the day
Down the street from Calumet, a school full of stones
He nicknamed me K-Rock so they'll leave me alone
Bulls jacket with his hat broke way off
And walked around the mall with his radio face off
Plus he had the spinner from his Daytons in his hand, keys in his hand
Reason again to let you know he's the man
Back when we rocked Alieses, he had dreams of Caprices
Drove by the teachers, even more by polices
How he get the cash the day his father passed away
Left him with a lil somethin, 16 he was stuntin'
""Al B. Sure"" nigga with the hair all wavy
Hit Lakeshore, girls go all crazy
Hit the freeway, go at least bout 80
Boned so much that summer, even had him a baby
See back back then then if you had a car
You was the Chi-Town version of Baby
And I was just a virgin, a baby
One of the reasons I looked up to him crazy
I used to love play my demo tape when the system yanked
Felt like I was almost signed when the shit got cranked
We'll take a Saturday and just circle the mall
They had they Lincoln's and Aurora's, we was hurtin 'em all
With the girls alot of flirtin' involved but dog..
Fuck all that flirtin', I'm tryin' to get in some drawers, so
Put me on with these hoes homie
He told me, ""Don't rush to get grown, drive slow homie""
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drive slow, homie
(Drive slow)
You never know, homie
About these hoes homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
What it do?
I'm posted up in the parking lot, my trunk wavin
The candy gloss is immaculate, its simply amazing
Them elbows pokin wide on that candy 'Lac
Trunk open, screens on, neon's lit with 5th relaxed
I'm on a mission for dime pieces and sexy ladies
Allow me to introduce you to my CL Mercedes
It's a star-studded event when I valet park
Open up my mouth and sunlight illuminates the dark
You see them 4's crawlin, you see them screens fallin
The disco ball in my mouth insinuates I'm ballin'
I'm leanin on the switch, sittin crooked in my slab
But I could still catches boppers if I drove a cab
A young Houston hard-hitter all about the scrilla
Ridin' somethin' candy-coated crawlin' like a caterpillar
I'm tippin' on them 4's, I'm jammin' on that Screw
I'm lookin' for them hoes baby, what it do
[Chorus: Kanye West (GLC)]
Drive slow, homie
(Turn your hazard lights on when you see them hoes)
Drive slow, homie
(If you ridin' around the city with nowhere to go)
Drive slow, homie
(Live today, cause tomorrow man, you never know)
You never know, homie
Might meet some hoes, homie
You need to pump your brakes and drive slow, homie
[Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got mo TV's in here than where I live
[GLC]
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
And everything I flip, you know it's somethin serious
I got the custom grill, I got the Bravis rims
I got the baller genetics baby this evidence
You see a player flickin', and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit (just a lil bit)
I wearin my custom kicks, I got my Jesus chain
My canary's is gleamin', through my angel wings
They see me, hoes actin' like they seen a king
With that mean lean, smokin on that finest Cali green
My woodgrain oak, I'm ridin on Vogues
My cylinder quiet, like tip-toes
I sold O's, and this I know
When you see them hoes, lil homie drive slow [echoes]
[Tony Williams harmony ad-libs]
[T.I.]
Lookin' at the life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen alot clearer after time had passed
Known for livin' so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, he constantly mashin'
(Why don't he slow down?) They be constantly askin'
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't tryna say that it's the way of the masses
But it, so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and Sigel cuttin' classes, showin' our ass
Shootin' out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember sellin' crack faster than I could bag it
A shame I ain't playin' with you shorty, I ain't braggin'
Me and Cap got life, some other folk got blasted
Had a partner OD'd and after this all happened
It's like the only thing that kept a pimp from cryin' and laughin'
And the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'd make it this far rappin'
For introducin' the youth to what we now call trappin'
Considered now a classic, who'da imagined?
Me in Milano, gettin' models in next year's fashions
So nowadays, they can call me old fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashin'
So I guess the moral of this here class is
Life about who make it now not about who make it the fastest
Drive slow homie
Dri, uh dri slowly

Excuse me miss, the artist of the new millenium
Has finally stopped drivin that blue Millenium
And got a good of trenny and filled it with plenty of Henney
and Remi and weed, 'til she higher than Hilliam
[Hook]
If she pass me, smoke that la-la-la
Memphis Bleek always smokin that la-la-la
Beanie Sigel, Desert Eagle, the four-ty five
It's the R.O.C. bitch, sing our lullaby
C'mon!
[Chorus]
Excuse me miss, I'm the shit
You should come, hang with me, basically
WHOA, skip all the singin' let's get right tonight, mami

How's your son? (all, all, all the things, things)
He make the team this year? (all, all, all the things things)
Aw th-, they said he wasn't tall enough?
(all, all, all the glitter in that gold)
Yeah me we gon' cook this up (now gold is not a reality)
(real is what you live to be)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
This is family business
And this is for the family that can't be with us
And this is for my cousin locked down, know the answer's in us
That's why I spit it in my songs so sweet
Like a photo of your granny's picture
Now that you're gone it hit us
Super hard on Thankgiving and Christmas, this can't be right
Yeah you heard the track I did man, this can't be light
Somebody please say grace so I can save face
And have a reason to cover my face
I even made you a plate, soul food, know how Granny do it
Monkey bread on the side, know how the family do it
When I brought it why did God have to look all to it?
As kids we used to laugh
Who knew that life would move this fast?
Who knew I'd have to look at you through a glass?
And look, tell me you ain't did it, you ain't did it
And if you did, then that's family business
[Hook: Choir]
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
This is family business
And this is for everybody standin' with us
Come on, let's take a family Grammy picture
Abby, remember when they ain't believe in me?
Now she like ""See, that's my cousin on TV""
Now, we gettin' it and we gon' make it
And y'all gon' hate it and I'm his favorite
I can't deny it, I'm a straight rider
But when we get together be electric slidin'
Grandma, get 'em shook up
Aw naw, don't open the photo book up
I got an Aunt Ruth that can't remember your name
But I bet them Polaroids'll send her down memory lane
You know that one auntie, you don't wanna be rude
But every holiday nobody eatin' her food
And you don't wanna stay there cuz them your worst cousins
Got roaches at their crib like them your first cousins
Act like you ain't took a bath with your cousins
Fit three in the bed while six of y'all
I'm talkin' 'bout three by the head and three by the leg
But you ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed
[Interlude: Choir]
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
Rain, rain, rain go away
Let the sun come out and all the children say
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I woke up early this mornin' with a new state of mind
A creative way to rhyme without usin' nines and guns
Keep your nose out the sky, keep your heart to God
And keep your face to the risin' sun
All my niggas from the Chi, that's my family dog
And my niggas ain't my guys, they my family dog
I feel like one day you'll understand me dog
You can still love your man and be manly dog
You ain't got to get heated at every house warmin'
Sittin' here, grillin' people like George Foreman
Why Uncle Ray and Aunt Shiela always performin'?
The second she storms out then he storms in
Y'all gon' sit down, have a good time this reunion
And drink some wine like Communion
And act like everything fine and if it isn't
We ain't lettin' everybody in our family business
[Interlude: Choir]
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
They don't mean a thing
(all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing, a thing
[Hook: Choir]
And I don't care 'bout (all the, all the diamond rings, diamond rings)
They don't mean a thing (all, all, all the things)
All these fancy things
I tell you that all (all the glitter) I'm waiting for
Now all I know I know all these things
[Females:] (oooh) All these things (these things)
[Males:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[F:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)
[M:] All these things (oooh) all these things (these things)

N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands

GET EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
KEEP EM HIGH
And if ya losin yo high than smoke again
KEEP EM HIGH
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
N-n-n-now, my flow
Is in the pocket like Wallace, I got the bounce like hydrolics
I can't call it, I got the swerve like alchoooool-ics
My freshman year I was goin through hell, a problem
Still I, built up the nerve to drop my ass up outta collllllll-ege
My teacher said I'se a loser, I told her why don't you kill me
I give a fuck if you fail me, I'm gonna folllllllllll-ow
My heart, and if you follow the charts, to the plaques or the stacks
You ain't gotta guess who's back, you see
I'm so shy that you thought it was bashfull but this
bastard's flow will bash a skull
And I will, cut your girl like Pastor Tro
And I don't, usually smoke but pass the 'dro
And I won't, give you that money that you askin fo'
Why you think, me and Dame cool, we ask hoes
That's why we here your music in fast fo'
Cuz we don't wanna here that weak shit no mo'

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
N-n-n-n-n-now who the hell is this
E-mailin me at 11:26, tellin me that she 36-26, plus double-d
You know how girls on black planet be when they get bubblee
At NYU but she headed from Kansas, right now she just lampin, chillin on
campus
Sent me a picture with a feelin on Candice
Who said her favorite rapper was the late great Francis
W-H-I-T, it's gettin late mami, your screen saver say tweet
So you got to call me, and bring a friend for my friend
His name Kweli
(You mean Talib, lyric sticks to your rib)
I mean
(That's my favorite CD that I play at my crib)
I mean
(You don't really know him, why is you lyin)
Yo Kwe, she don't believe me, please pickup the line
She gon' think that I'm lyin, just spit a couple of lines
Then maybe I'll be able to give her dick all the time, and get her high
[Verse 3: Talib Kweli]
Yeah
I can't believe this nigga use my name for pickin up dolls but
GET EM HIGH, I need some tracks you tryin to pull tracks out
And my rhymes as fittin to blow you tryin to blow back south
Well ok, you twisted my arm, I'll asist with the charm, aiyyo
I though you meet that chickit that got friends with yo moms
And she's the bomb, boy she got the boujI behavior
Always got somethin to say like a bookee playa hater
Anyway, I don't usualy fuck a interneter
Draws stuck to they arm like Nicorette
You really fuckin that much, you tryin to get off cigarettes
And she think it's fly, she ain't met a real nigga yet
I appoligize if I come off a little inconsiderate
I got the bubble cushion a sister could get ahead of it
[Verse 4: Common]
Get em high like noon, or the moon or room filled with smoke
A high filled with dope
Y'all assumed I was doomed, out of tune, but I still feel the notes
The real nigga quotes
Real rappers is hard to find, like a remonte, control rap is not a
Used soup it still got life, that's why I abuse you who are not thugs
Rock clubs, it's like Tiger, Woods in the hood, to have my own reality show
Called Soul Survivor, I stole all liver, niggaz in you
You'se a bitch I got ones that are thicker than you
How could I ever let your words affect me, they say Hip-Hop is dead
I'm here to resurrect me, mosh is to sexy to even make songs like these
That's why the raw don't know your name, like Alicia Keys
To many featured emcees, and pro-ducers is populer
Twelve thousand spins, nobody got to coppin her
Album, how come, you the hot garbager
The years clear your image and snooped up
Label got you souped up, tellin you you sick
Man you a dick with a loose nut
Video hard to watch like Medusa
Even your club record need a booster
Chimped up, with a pimp cup, illeaterate nigga
Read the infa, red across your head I'm bread king like Simba
Bolder then Denver, I ain't a Madd Rapper just a emcee with a temper
You dansin for money like honey, I did this my way
So when the industry crash, I survive like Kanye
Spittin through wires and fires, emcees retirin
Got yo hands up, get them motherfuckers higher then
[Chorus: Kanye West]
N-now, th-th-through ya motherfuckin hands
GET EM HIGH
All the girls pass the weed to ya motherfuckin man
GET EM HIGH
Now I ain't never tell you to put down ya hands
KEEP EM HIGH

See me at the airport, at least 20 Louis
Treat me like the Prince and this my sweet brother Numpsay

Take 'em to the show and talk all through the movies
Says she want diamonds, I took her to Ruby Tuesdays
If we up in Friday's, I still have it my way

Gone - we ride on chrome

What you rappers could get is a job from me
Maybe you could be my intern, and in turn
I'll show you how I cook up summer, in the win-turr
Aaron love the raw dog, when will he learn
Caught somethin on the Usher tour he had to ""Let it Burn""
Plus he already got three chil'run
Arguin over babysitters like, ""Bitch - it's yo' turn!""
Damn 'Ye, it'd be stupid to ditch you
Even your superficial raps is super official

With TV's in the ride, throw a movie on
Said he couldn't rap now he at the top with doobie long

No concealin, no ceiling I don't need a roof
Act up, get out, I don't need you poof
Poof, be gone, damn tough luck dag

Pull the truck up fast and I tell 'em
Hey, back in a touched up Jag, shit
Y'all niggaz want Killa Cam, cerebellum
An old man just gon' tell 'em (too late, he, gone)

Fine stay, you got the grind hey
Came back, read what the sign say (too late, he, gone)
Yes I know you wanna see my demise
Yeah you church boy actin like a thief in disguise
Ain't leavin my side, see the greed in my eyes
Ask Abby y'all hustle for a week to the Chi, shit
And that ain't leavin alive, please believe me
Gave Weezy a piece of the pie, and
You can ask George or Regina
The whole Westside I explore with the Beemer now

Listen homeboy move on
That's your best bet, why's that?

I been pourin out some liquor for the fact that my pal's gone
And tryin to help his momma with the fact that her child gone
And since we used to bubble like a tub full of Calgon
Guess it's only right that I should help her from now on
But since they got a foul on, what coulda gone wrong
Now they askin Cons, how long has this gone on
And maybe all this money mighta gone to my head
Cause they got me thinkin money mighta gone to the feds
So I ain't goin to the dread, but he'll go on up to bed
And when I came the next mornin he was gone with my bread
And with that bein said, I had gone on my instincts
And gone to the spots where they go to get mixed drinks
But lookin back now shoulda gone to the crib
And rented ""Gone With the Wind,"" cause I'da gone about 10
But I had gone with my friend, and we had gone to the bar
And heard a nigga talkin shit so I had gone to the car
And now the judge is tellin me that I had gone too far
And now we gone for 20 years, doin time behind bars
And since I gone to a cell for some cruddy crimes
I guess I gone to the well one too many times, cause I'm gone

We could get up off this cheap-ass sofa
What the summer of the Chi got to offer an 18-year-old
Sell drugs or get a job, you gotta play gyro
My dawg worked at Taco Bell, hooked us up plural-fied
A week later the manager count the churros
Sometimes I can't believe it when I look up in the mirrow
How we out in Europe, spendin Euros
They claim you never know what you got 'til it's GONE
I know I got it, I don't know what y'all on
I'ma open up a store for aspiring MC's
Won't sell 'em no dream, but the inspiration is free
But if they ever flip sides like Anakin
You'll sell everything includin the mannequin
They got a new bitch now you Jennifer Aniston

Heavy hitters for life
You rappers think I give a f*ck about the way the day spent
Want to be on my album but don't want me on they sh*t
Everybody thought i was makin a compelation
I was really makin myself they competation.
Fresh off the plane form the all star game.
Bone girls on t.v so it's all star trains
Just picture man. No stichin man.
somethin for the phiends fresh out the kitchen man.
Last 9/11 I was poor on a half till I floored up my math
Now it's Porsche 9/11 and I'm floorin the gas
Problems that i had no more.
well damn look at how everybody den changed
all my niggas is bout to have it made
tell j that i'm bout to change the game
this makes everything else sound played
goddamn Kanye! Kanye! Kanye!
Now hold up. Ain't nobody makin with me dog now you say it.
Ain't nobody messin with you at all
I told dude you can't even rap on my interlude
now does that make me as rude as Jude?
When the album comin out man the people is askin
Yall got motive adidas ya sick with the fashion
Ya already got do so ya spit for the passion
the way ya rhymes give me Tribe Called Quest flash backs
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
nope nope let's not do that man
ya eatin up the game like Pac man
and got the whole world shakin just like crack phiends.
Heavy hitters for life
Roca fella is for life throw them diamonds up throw them diamonds up trow ya diamonds

(Hey Mama), I wanna scream so loud for you, cuz I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do, (Hey Mama)
I know I act a fool but, I promise you I'm goin back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me
I just want you to be proud of me (Hey Mama)
[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take yall back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if yall don't mind
I was three years old, when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that mommy cant you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cuz a nigga cheatin, telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy Imma love you till you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you aint gotta work no more
And Imma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're, unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin loot
A livin legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Forrest Gump mama said, life is like a box of chocolates
My mama told me go to school, get your doctorate
Somethin to fall back on, you could profit with
But still supported me when I did the opposite
Now I feel like it's things I gotta get
Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir please
Give me a verse of ?You, Are So Beautiful To Me?
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry
Maya Angelou, Nicky Giovanni, turn one page and there's my mommy
Come on mommy just dance wit me, let the whole world see your dancing feet
Now when I say Hey, yall say Mama, now everybody answer me (Hey Mama)
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I guess it also depends tho, if my ends low
Second they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
[Verse 3]
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
Imma get you a jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say (Hey Mama)
[Chorus] (with variations)

Ok
I'm getting spins all day in L.A
Luv, we can go the D where Dwele dwell
D.C, P.G or ATL
Back in The CHI I made my life like the magazine
Honey wanna know the details about my Ebony
Well that's X-X-L
Far as the penthouse, yeah that's upscale
Mademoiselle got a hell of a Black tail
I'm feeling her vibe, her Body and Soul
I heard you stay in a metropolitan home
Well lets kill all the parlay'in and offer you a comsopolitan
Lets jet out the club, get some oxygen
Your friends claim I'm a player, you be lucky to keep me
But you know people gon' be talking 'bout us weekly
My car be, in a robbery, P.O.R.T but what's more important to me
is that you..
(Dwele)
Open your ears
Don't allow these words to be ignored by years
Fearing lullibies, containing the same old lies (same old lies)
Dealing just to deal is just a crime
Besides I know you wouldn't mind
Trying something new so..

If you let love(love) guide (guide)

Oh(Oh) Why(Why)
Let this opportunity pass (pass) by (by)
You should hold on
Please don't resist (don't resist)
Bless those harmonies to me, escape your lips (escape your lips)
There's no need to go home
Just to dance along (dance aloo-o-one)
I know you can't enjoy it on your own
Really I don't see nothing wrong
With you and I spending some time--
Also let me mention, (Oooh)
My only intention, (Oooh)
Is to feed you every single thing you hunger for---
In my heart I have to (Oooh)
And-- want to have you (Oooh)
So fulfilled that you will never need to ask for more--

Now someone told my girl that she's a trophy wife
Sorta like Grant Hill and Koby's wife
So when we at a club, and she be so polite
But when we back at home she be poltergeist
I mean provoking fights
Trying to poke me with knifes
And last time I tried to poke her she just told me goodnight
See her clothing be tight
She was pervert approved
So she gave up on life, now she don't wanna move
Hypnotized by the tube
So she stay with the clicker
In a cup full of liquor
Thinkin its makin her thicker
But its makin her slimmer
So our future is dimmer
I cant remember last time I took my baby to dinner
See I'm sayin' a sister who was freaky and ruthless
In a yorkshire terrier in the pocket with pooches
In a pocket with Gucc's
Was taking my lunch money
Just like the gooches
I'll tell you the truth miss

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers aint make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Whoooooooaa
Never leave me alooooooooone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be coming home
My homie called me like what up man
Not from Florida but what up fam
It's been a whole lot of hatin again
And if they hatin on me damn what up then
I met this girl when I was three years old
and what I love most she had so much soul
She said excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me but uh my name is wendy (windy) and yo, I like to blow trees
and from that point I never blow her off
niggas come from out of town I like to show her off
They like to act tough she like to tore em off
and make them straighten up they hat cuz she know they soft
and when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown
and at nighttime her face lit up, so astounding
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never mess with entertainers 'cuz they always leave
She said it feel like you walked and drove on me
knew I was gang affiliated got on t.v. and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said Ye, keep makin that platinum and gold for me
but if you really cared for her
Then you would have never hit the airport and followed your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
but when I talk to her it always seem like she talkin bout me
She said you left ya kids and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you
and I just got through
Talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got till is gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
and guess when I heard that when I was back home
In the interviews I'm representin you makin you proud
Shoot for the stars so if you fall you land on the clouds
Jump in the crowds
Spark ya lighters and wave 'em around
If you don't know by now I'm talkin about Chi-town

Go ahead roll it up and pass it round
Cause lately's been a whole lot of bullshit going down
A lot of soldiers aint make it through this year
So lets just celebrate that we still here and
Whoooooooaa
Never leave me alooooooooone
Tell em holla at ya boyyy and cause I'll be comin home
I'll be comin home
Ooh, never leave me alooooooooone

Move back to 92 I was just like you
Please don't get confused by the ice and jewels
I'm like any other guy that buy ice to stay cool
Like any other nigga that claim they hate school
And think yeah Free's banging, but she no Racheal
(chours)
We ball till we fall
Hit the mall
After we hit don't call
Fill your lives
With nothing, but lies
And I would like to apoligize
(repeat twice)
You can't stand right here
And tell me everything is going to be all right
Cuz until the day a man starts to stand up I'm going have to improvise
verse2
Was it something I did wrong yeah I know I'm wrong
She's at home alone and I'm always gone
Hate it when she's mad, but more when she's passive
Now she on the internet looking for classes
Out of state though man that hurt yo
But I got work though and I'm at work yo
And she don't call alot, but when she do she pouring out her heart
You never listen to me then the call drop mmmmm
And I promised her everything
Told her when I get a deal I'll get her a wedding ring
But when I got my deal I was back in the ring
Fighting my urges
Strip club flurges
Never had money so I felt like a virgin
And I'm trying to break the banks cherry
Trying she can I afford a Carnary
With a Ferry and a dinner date with Halle Berry
Went from 50gs to 50 hundred in a week
Now I'm trying to call
One ring Two ring Seven ring Eight ring
Her mother pick up the phone
Like she at school and she don't stay here no more
I guess it's more good women than men percentage wise
So her chance of having a husband in minimize
I guess that's why she say she ain't into guys
Focus on school full time to improvise

You know what the Midwest is?
Young & Restless
Where restless Niggaz might snatch your necklace
And next these Niggaz might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these Niggaz who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless Uhhhh!
Try to catch it Uhhhh! It's kinda hard hard
Getting choked by the detectives yeah yeah now check the method
They be asking us questions, harass and arrest us
Saying ""we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Yall eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke rental car from Avis
My momma used to say only Jesus can save us
Well momma I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone til November I got packs to move I Hope

The only thing that I pray is that me feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
And I don't think there is nothing I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks with me)
I want to talk to God but I'm afraid because we ain't spoke in so long
To the hustlas, killers, murderers, drug dealers even the strippers
To the victims of Welfare for we living in hell here hell yeah
Now hear ye hear ye want to see Thee more clearly
I know he hear me when my feet get weary
Cuz we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers are role models we rap we don't think
I ain't here to argue about his facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just trying to say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis that's the way yall need Jesus
So here go my single dog radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, video tapes
But if I talk about God my record won't get played Huh?
Well let this take away from my spins
Which will probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreaming about
Next time I'm in the club everybody screaming out

Between the girls and the jewelry
The devil trying to lure me
And view of me
(Jesus walks with me)
My pastor shaking his head
he ain't sure of me
But surely
(Jesus walks with me)
Then he ask
do you say your prayers at least 2 a week?
I ain't talking to God I know what I've been doing G.
Do you know how I be embarrassed?
my prez sound like Ben Stiller on Meet the Parents
and I ain't good with that ?give us our day?,
this ladies just trying to give us our free
I'm trying to give us, us pay,
now you know how them strippers was,
We was all ghetto-fabulous all at the rooms at the Cyberus,
from this Jacuzzi wild can you cleanse us?
Can you please unfog my Cardierre lenses?
God sends signs sometimes only in glimpses for me I almost died
falling asleep in them Benzes
Theirs something about this beat that get me tranquilized
and when I play it at my shows I feel sanctified
and HE gives me direction when I can't decide
He is alive!, how can you tell me he ain't when I said
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down

The only thing I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

And Now I think there's something I can say now
that will right my wrongs
(Jesus Walks)
I finally talked to God and I ain't afraid cause his love is so strong
[Ma$e]
Before you take me name, take my fame,
Why you had to take my shame, take my flaws, take my blame
Feel my dirt, conceal my hurt, See my bruise,
and this you walk in my shoes
You weren't there when I was in deep thought.
When I had two choice, kill him or either leave New York
But I'm a truth teller and that's why I say what I'm sayin
And the only thing the radio playin is cause you be payin
It ain't about who really hot no more
Beats would knock no more
so who cares who flock no more
I realize that most labels pay you for lies
And all that blood do is gain disguise
That you're favorite artist shhhh
I know you hear that huh you wanna fear that what
Your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that
Con the rap this like John the Baptist
prepare the way for what I came to say today
They deceived us, had us thinking Jesus really didn't need us
When he loved up all you
He loved them boys in hallway up in Broadway
even those who meet him for dope every 4 days
To the strippers in broad day up in Norway
To the Detroit player Gators in Moreys
With me its not just bars and music I walk with God
I have the scares to prove it,ugh
(Jesus Walks)
God show me the way now the devil can't break me down
(Jesus Walks)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus Walks)
Everybody out there just lift your hands
right now and say this with me:
?Father I thank you, for forgiving me, for everything I ever done,
for Jesus walking with me, for dying for me, raising for me,
and all my sins have been forgiven, I'm a changed man,
I'm healed I'm delivered,I'm rich and It's all because of him?
Now Walk with me, Walk with me, Walk Walk Walk with me
Walk with me

Your broke-ass mamma couldn't afford that abortion
Now tell me how the Hell so gon' afford that coffin?
Now I done sat back and seen it all too often
The backbone of this like Marino to the Dolphins
Most hits out the shot since Sosa and Andre Dawson
My niggaz had Pro Tools, I had no tools
Karaoke machine, fuck it I'm old school
Only difference is my tracks drove niggaz postal
So I drove costal while they stay local
How I can't rhyme when my freestyles'll roast you?
Sit down I'll coach you while we style in posters
Dog, niggaz had a chance to sign me, dropped the ball
I'll see you at the awards.. HUMPH!
Now after all that it took
I made it to The Roc, I'm guess I ain't as dumb as you look

Damn, I know you say he's killin' hisself
He got a little bitty deal now he feelin' hisself
Yup, just cuz I played beats and act hospitable
Don't mean I can't get you changed to hospital you
I'm from a raw family, dog, and I'll spit on you
So play like a kid in the garden and get little you
Who ya hype man? I'm curious
It got you souped up like the cars on The Fast & Furious
You goin' through movin' critters, now who's laughin'?
The best producer that rap better than the rappers

You know we too old for this like Holyfield still boxin'
Ya will watch and I look back, ya still watchin'

I got rims, not 20s but I got 10s
Real real clean, come and get your rear wheel cleaned
She did what with who? Man I hear things
Like when I was doin' my dirt and she heard things
Up worryin' while she wore her ring
Now she got a fling and where's her ring?
That devious is in the purse now, feelin's in the dirt now
Somebody buyin' the bar, quenchin' her thirst now
Somebody bought her a dress, she in the church now
And what's worse now, she ain' gotta work now
She cuffed an NBA player from the first round
I grabbed her neck and made it hurt to breathe
She said ""Security, this jerk could leave""
And uh

So do just what you want anytime that you really like
I put a payment on my place, you be sleepin' alone tonight

Big chains, gold teeth, and yo gleam on (Roc-a-Fella chain)

It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Niggaz wanna diss K
On they're local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya
A little arrogant with all your compares
'Cause as far as the Chi
I got the most black sister beginnin' to rap
And nah, I ain't mentionin' that
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie whole
And wanna figure out why I'm gettin' it high though
Why? 'Cause you need fire, and I'm a pyro
When you prepare, would you copy what I do and say?
Only difference between you and me, you were gay
Ahhhhh, did he get his feelin's hurt?
Nahhhh, he's got titties under his shirt
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
When you walk straight, niggaz tend to look at you sideways
I say, Fuck that dog, I get my own way
Niggaz ain't believe me 'till they see me on t.v
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then passin' up Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars, all better
'Cause the couches in the rooms got, more leather
And we gon' flip Carter, when we could afford better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
You still dress (Ardjo), but only pay partial
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
Polo and (Carbesher's), we into them things dogg
Back in '96 we was livin' like kings dogg
40 cals or better, tottin' them things dogg
So up the turkish snake, and take them rings off
I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
What more, and what's more than this -
I did it my way

Yeah Grandmama
Told you i won't let you down
Told you i won't let this rap game change me, right?
[Chorus:]
When it comes to being truem, at least true to me
One thing i found,one thing i found
Oh no you'll neva let me down,
Get up i get(down)

[Jay-Z:]
Yo, yo first i snatched the street then i snatched the charts,
First had they ear now i hav they're heart,
Rappers came and went,
I've been hear from the start,
Seen them put it together
Watch them take it apart,
See the rollers roll up wit ribbons
I see the we poe, we sold then we driven
So when i reload, he holds #1 position
When u hot i'm hot
And when your feet cold, mines is sizzelin
It's plain to see
Nigga's can't f*** wit me
Cuz ima be that nigga fo life
This is not an image
This is God given
This is hard liven
Mixed wit crystall sippin
It's the most consistent
Hov
Give you the most hits you can fit inside a whole disc and
Nigga I'm home on these charts, y'all niggaz visitin
It's Hov tradition, Jeff Gordan of rap
I'm back to claim pole position, holla at ya boy
[Chorus]
[Kanye West:]
I get down for my grandfather who took my momma
Made her sit that seat where white folks aint wanna us to eat
At the tender age of 6 she was arrested for the sit in
With that in my blood i was born to be different
Now niggas can't make it to battles to chose leadership
But we can make it to jacobs to ****** the dealership
That's why i hear new music
And i jus dun b feelin it
Racism still alive they jus be consealin it
But i know they don't want me in the damn club
They even made me show I.D to get up in to sam's club
I did dirk and went to church and get my hands scrubbed
That why i've baptised at least 3 or 4 times
But in the land where nigga's pray
U con's are getting paid
It gon take a lot more than coupons to get us saved
Like it take a lot more than do-rags to get your way
Notin sadder than that day my girl father past away
So i promised to MR.rany i'm gonna marry your daughter
And u know i gotta thank u for they way that she was brought up
And i know that u were smiling when u see that car i bought her
And u sent tears from heaven when u seen my car get balled up
But i can't complaint what the accident did to my left eye
Cuz look what a accident did to left eye
First Aaliyah and now romeo must die
I know a got angels watchin me from the other side
[Chorus x2]
[J.Ivy:]
We are all here for a reason on a particular path
You don't need a curriculum to know that you are part of the math
Cats think I'm delirious, but I'm so damn serious
That's why I expose my soul to the globe, the world
I'm trying to make it better for these little boys and girls
I'm not just another individual, my spirit is a part of this
That's why I get spiritual, but I get my hymns from Him
So it's not me, it's He that's lyrical
I'm not a miracle, I'm a heaven-sent instrument
My rhythmatic regimen navigates melodic notes for your soul and your mental
That's why I'm instrumental
Vibrations is what I'm into
Yeah, I need my ???
But that is not what gives me the heart of Kunte Kinte
I'm tryina give us ??? like ???
I can't stop, that's why I'm hot
Determination, dedication, motivation
I'm talking to you, my many inspirations
When I say I can't, let yourself down
If I were of the highest cliff, on the highest riff
And you slipped down the side and ??? your life in my grip
I would never, ever let you down
And when these words are found
Let it been known that God's ??? has been signed with a language called love
That's why my breath is felt by the deaf
And why my words are heard and confined to the ears of the blind
I, too, dream in color and in rhyme
So I guess I'm one of a kind in a full house
Cuz whenever I open my heart, my soul, or my mouth
A touch of God reigns out
[Chorus]

We cant even sit and talk, without you arguing
You're the one who started it
[Kanye West]
[Verse 1]
I got a girl at home but she don't cook
I have my condoms in the stove cuz she wont look
And she never ever go to the grocery store
So I figure its safe to pull a grocery hoe
She was buyin Alize out the liquor isle
She said ?I hope its not too ghetto?
Rocked all gold force back in style
I kept her number on file for my girl be actin wild
Like last week I told her take me to the mall
But she don't drive
My other girl picked me up at 3:05
She got a brand new car, 16
Now the car only 1 years old, oh
Man but the body look grown, whoa
Before I catch a case I better take my ass home
Where the problems is, arguments be +Daly+ like Carson is
But the problem is..
[Chorus]
We can't even sit and talk no more, without you arguing
Girl you must be out of your mind, no no no
You're the one who started it
[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a second man
That's that thrift store info, that's all second hand
Why don't you talk to the mouth of the horses ?bout my porches
Condos in front of the golf courses
Instead you stay up, countin every second like a fake rollie
I'm real, so you know I move real slowly
The way the censorship'll go off, you know me
I aint call you, you wanna know why?
Im in Noha, Hon aloha, pushin jet skis so I
Couldn't return the pages on my Motorola
Nextel, my cell, it don't work down there
What happened in Cancun? Stays down there
What's happenin here? Made me wish I stayed down there
Take a seat, why you always makin a beef?
You know these walls too thin in this apart-a-ment
Now everybody hearin our arguments
But the problem is..
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Man, boo you know what I do
So don't trip when I come home after 2 or 3 or 4
I aint messin with them girls no more
It's weak, the benz coupe is so sweet
When I roll down the street, tears roll down her cheek
She said, ?You must love that car more than me
And nigga I was with you before the cheese
So you need to work on your pri-or-ities
If she went with Fabolous I bet that she would be
A-R-G-U-I-N-G and please
I'm not actin like this cuz I'm getting spins on
W-K-R-B in Cincinnati
You think I'd get my voice so deep like
W-K-R-B in Cincinnati
That's how much of a fuck I give
You seen cribs? That's how the fuck I live
As far as this?

It's time to hit the dance floor get crazy again
And get that +CashMoney+ like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted, so tinted she squinted
She said ?This car real old?; I told her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club
And get a girl that's into the fitness
Tryin to get into the business, Imma make her my apprentice
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get insiiiide

Now I been hustling my whole life
Tryin to get this money up and I think I finally got it right

Wise men say
Wise men say
The baddest niggas out there bro
Never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
You'll never figure out real love
Its so crazy
I got everything figured out
But for some reason I can never find what real love is about
No doubt
Everything in the world figured out but I can never seem to find what real love is about
Do you think I sacrificed real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
Do you think I sacrifice a real life
For all the fame of flashing lights?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no YSL that they could sell
To get my heart out of this hell
And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy
Its funny Pinocchio lied and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep running
Its like I'm looking for something out there trying to find something
I turn on the TV and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?
Not some facade on TV that no can really feel
Do you really have the stamina...
For everybody that sees you and that say 'where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you and says 'sign my autograph'
For everybody that sees you and says that 'you all that'
You all that
I just want to be a real boy,
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes...
And there is no Gepetto to guide me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me I cant find her no more,
I cant find her no more I cant...
the only one that come out on the tour and stay, stay, stay...
Back when I was living at home and this was all a big dream
And the fame will be got caught
And the day I moved to LA
Maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American dream,
Chasing everything we seen
Up on the TV screen
And when I- the Benz was left
And the clothes was left
And the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
You spent the doughs to death
And tell me what-tf for a real boy
They say Kanye you keep it too real boy
Perspective and Wise man say, one day you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way
The wise man say, you'll find your way

And we gone stay showing off that jewelry that we bought
And we gone stay heated in case it's in and out of court
'Cause we some gangstas, I don't know what the fuck you thought

'Cause I confine myself to a city near you in a solid cage
And you could look to the left and the right, but I'm trapped on center stage
And I could rap to the beat, but I don't know how to change my wage
I still hear a pull and I track 'em, and strack 'em, and whack 'em
Jack a nigga for the day to days and I yak 'em, attack 'em, and sack 'em
Get a weapon and I crack his brain 'cause I'm hustler, baller, pro
And it wouldn't be right for me to be around busters, and crawlers, and hoes
But I'm a pimp at night so talk shit and I'm gonna lift 'em up off of their toes
With a street sweeper regulating quarters, and ki's, and o's
In the two seater, Ludacris and Twista with bags of 'dro
Smoking and choking, get 'em up and croaking
It's so potent, I'm hoping to keep on floating
Soaking wet and you can bet, people I'm high
I'm seeing lions, and tigers and bears - oh my!
And I can't hide it and keep it hidden, good riddance of feeling good
I'm weapon-concealing, stealing my neighborhood
Would, could, and should break a nigga off

I feel it all over my body, adrenaline with the Bacardi

In the netti confetti with a belly, gucci

Want to get me for the wood
Better get the whole motherfucking 'hood to come and give you some back up
We can get into it and if you want to do it

If they ever got some blood for fucking with thugs that I bury

Represent for the city, anybody that different with me

And whether you in my city and I talk shit

Or I'm gonna stick him up for the scrilla, from K-Tilla, smoking on a fat pilla

He claimed my heart can't take the anastesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
The little thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beeping,
Hey chick, im at a lost for words
What do you say at this time?
Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gone be fine?
But i'd be lying, the family crying
They want her to live, and she trying
I'm argueing like what kind of doctor can we fly in
You know the best medicine go to people thats paid,
If Magic Johnson got a cure for A.I.D.'s
And all the broke muthafuckers past away
You tellin me if my grandma was in the N.B.A.
Right now she'd be ok?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church
For thirty five years
Things sposed to stop right here
My grandfather tryin to pull it together, he strong,
Thats where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse ""did you do the research?""
She ask me, ""can you sign some t-shirts?""
Bitch is you smokin reefer?
You dont see that we hurt

Hey chick what these doctors know anyway
Let me see the X-rays
I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off for work
Plus my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Claire and Aunt Jean
So many Aunties, we could have an Auntie team
Feel like Amerie ""Its this one thing""
When they said that she made it
You see the eyes gleam
I think we at an all time high
To get there we run, we fly, we drive
Coz with my family we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers
We the roses...

I told her to drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
Imma bring da cool whip

See you is my new chick
So we get our grind on
She be grabbin, callin me Biggie like Shine home
Man I swear she fine homes
Why she always lying though
Tellin me them diamonds when she know they rhinestones
She got a light skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I play 'Ready for the World' - she was ready for some action
My dawg said you aint no freak, so you got to prove my man wrong
Imma play this Vandross
You gon' take your pants off
Imma play this Gladys Knight
Me and you gon' get right
[Chorus X2]
[Twista]
Got you lookin at the gliss at my hands and wrists
While i'm layin back smokin on my canibus
When it come to rockin the rythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you aint no messin with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi and I be
Sippin Hennessy
Play some R&B
Tryina smoke a B
Lookin properly
Feelin on a G?
And always (Well Well Well Well Well)
Come with me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You aint know Twista can work it like the Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isaac
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little spinners
While I'm
Smokin on a B
Dippin through the streets
Bumpin R&B
And I got to leave
something to the 23's?
And I do it (well well well well well)
When my earth and the wind smoke a fire
Let me when get your sheets wet listening to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze for maze
Fullfilling our every temptation slow jamming having deep sex
You ready for the world girl
Come on over make me touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
An every moment you controllin' me I'm lovin the way you be holding me when I be listening to Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin Teddy Pendergrass
I'da hit it from the back to the melody to roll it slow
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but imma finish last
No matter how much of a thug you see
I still spit it like it's R&B, so to the club with me
And with some Luther come on and hope you finna and stilla be in love with me
[chorus X2]
[Twista]
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
Stay up in the zone
Got to get you home
Gotta run up on
And I do it (well well well well well)
Baby drop another slow jam
And all us lovers need hold hands
And if you aint got no man hop up on my brohem
I keep it pimpin like an old man
You gots to roll with the plan
Cuz after that then I
Take you to my home
And we could get it on
Disconnect the phone
Just to get you goin'
Tryina make you moan
And I do it (well well well well well)

I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, man, man
If my manager insults me again I will be assaulting him
After I fuck the manager up then I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Mayback
So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow
[Hook: GLC]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
[Verse 2: Consequence]
Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' known ass on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself
Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God ""Man why'd you had to take my folks?""
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's
Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure
[Hook: GLC]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
[Verse 3: Consequence]
I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers say ""Yo you look just like
This kid I seen in the old Busta Rhymes video the other night""
Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows
I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me
And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til my spaceship takes off
[Hook: GLC]
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky
I've been workin' this graveshift and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship and fly past the sky

I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride

Good morning America, good morning to Erica
Who gave me good head while watching good morning America
And good day New York, have a good day in court
My niggaz drive around the hood looking for good ye' to snort
I never liked the goodbyes, always caught a good vibe
Always had a good time, could always spot a good guy
From a good guy, look alive, look alive, look or try
You know that old saying what they say about good guys
I bet that's why I went bad, needed all my chips bad
Fiends needed it bad, started hittin liq' bad
Had to get that work off before that shit went bad
If not, it gets bad, and things will only get bad
So now I'm getting bad skin, and I got that badge and
Tellin me them bastards, don't catch a bad break
Caught a bad rate on whip with bad brakes
I'm caught up in these bad ways havin a bad day
So now the game's ugly, and my pain's ugly
And my chain's ugly, things became ugly, cuz I'm ugly ducklin
Got a stain and its musty, wakin up looking crusty
And miss thang who's ugly is sayin to me ?don't touch me?
I went from pretty willie to pretty silly
But I'm still pretty gully so you thins will still get pretty ugly
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
Chorus 1: [Kanye West]
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
B.I.G. said get ya money ain't no telling they gon love me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
When your money get funny and them days ain't sunny
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
Niggaz give pounds and hug me, tho they really wanna slug me
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly
And this for the hood, you got to love me
[Kanye West]
Good morning to ummm, I don't remember your name
But I remember the brain, here go a fare for the train and
Good morning to Chi-Town, where my niggaz ride down
And bust clowns, and look for some bustdowns to bust down
And she ain't got a car she on the bus now
But her gear is bangin, she one of us now
I wanted badly to bone cuz she was bad to the bone
She from a batter home, she mad when she at home
So I gave her my number to beep off, she wanted to take a week off
Bustin scary movie nuts, I had to get the freak off
The new Tom Cruise, took the Moulan Rouge on a too long cruise
She said ?I ain't bonin you with them two long shoes?
And I get bougie in a grape poupon mood
So I'm gon act cheap in a coupon mood
She said ?Ye' you don't love me??
I told her that's the good, the bad, the ugly
Chorus 2:

Good morning to Queens, the north side of my scene
And when it comes down to it, I'm a ride for my team
See it's a beautiful life, but the bills will make it ugly
And the beauty of life, is when you're forced to make it ugly
Had a beautiful night, until a storm done made it ugly
And a beautiful wife, now we divorcing and its ugly
Now my mind state is ugly, my blind dates are ugly
I'm ready to turn it up in the streets and make it ugly
Used to sit in Mr. Uglies with these chickens that were ugly
And these bitches used to bug me to the point it made me ugly
Say things that were ugly in regards to their tummies
But I took it all back, cuz God don't like ugly
Now I'm curbin my bad words, they say that the bad burn
I left it on bad terms, with a chic with a bad perm
Whose case took a bad turn, and face caught a bad burn
And took the news bad when they said she had bad germs
The bad thing about it, the bitch was bad and bout it
But the pussy smelled bad, so I had to get up out it
So now we got bad blood, her son is a bad blood
But it happens in the hood when you inherit that bad blood
And once it get bad, it be bad for good
THAT'S BAD MEANING BAD NOT BAD MEANING GOOD
But I greet it as good, when you leave with the good
Its all good in the hood, got called good cuz I'm good
Now I'm havin some good nights, livin this good life
Got me a good girl that I'm gon make me a good wife
So I'm, good to go, and I'm good where I go
Look my man got good aim and that's a good thing to know
And he came home for good, off of good behavior
Spittin that good game, so what's good with this paper
And this is for the hoods, the crabs, the junkies
We showin you the good, the bad, the ugly

Can that huh?

Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all away
Right down through the wire, even through the fire
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kanye to the....
Chi-Town what's going on man
[Verse 1:]
I drink a boost for breakfast, and ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man bizzerk
Not to worry the Mr. H to the izzles back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
When you telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emitt Till
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing them Dynasty signs
I'm use to trying to reline
I been trying to signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make the band
I swear this right here is history in the making man
[Chorus]
I really apologize how I sound right now man
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now yo
This is what I gotta say yo
Yeah, turn me up yeah
[Verse 2:]
What if somebody from the Chi was ill got a deal on the hottest rap label around
But he wasn't talking bout coke and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't to cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe; safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I
I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky, it was televised
All they heard was that I was in an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, would you thought they called me Mr. Glass
Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus]
Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um..  I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg don't you think didn't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on

Uh, yeah, feels like, uh, every sunshine is brighter
Sunsets feel righter
Please light ya lighter for the producer and the writer
Feel like I wrote this
I'm just here to quote this
I don't know if you notice but I'm actually pitchin' bogus
Doctor, doctor, would you please say somethin'?
I know I almost was the final destination
I musta had a blessin' from Pastor Mason
Cuz that trip to L.A. coulda been my last vacation
And, man, I know I can drop a down payment on that Porsche Cayenne
But, what, I went along with the plan
Paid for my own video, directed by my man
Man, I know God was holdin' my hand
Wouldn't let me go before I go on Def Poetry Jam
Wouldn't let me throw in the towel 'fore I got to throw in some vowels
'Bout what we goin' through now
Girls got a crush on me like I did beats for Mr. Cheeks
And since the accident they tellin' me it's the cheeks
And if you look at history
That last rapper that almost died sold 6.5
'Cept I'm comin' from the Chi
Through the wire to the wall
All my rhymes is raw
All these beats beats beats beats beats
All of them could of been lost
I always got to floss
I almost paid the cost
So before I go to sleep sleep sleep
Always thank the Lord
For this mic and my keyboard
Heck naw, that boy is raw
You hear that? That's all that jewelry I got on man
Sometimes I take it off at the airport but I still get stopped
They be like ""There go Kayne, there go Kayne!
Can I see some I.D. please? So thank you very much""
First of all, my momma named me Kanye so y'all gon' call me Kanye
I'm like the girl on the 'Sixth Sense'

Aiyyo, two words, Chi town, South side, world wide
Cuz I, rep that, till I, fuckin die
One neck, two chains, one waist, two gats
One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, ""Gimme that""
I am limelight, Blueprint, 5 Mics
Go get his rhyme like, shoulda been signed twice
Most imitated, Grammy nominated
Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
Barbershop, playa hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it
Felt like it rained till the roof caved in
Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
So I live by two words, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Screamin, Jesus save me
You know how the game be
I can't let em change me
Cuz on Judgment Day, you gon blame me
Look God, it's the same me
I (Throw) basically know now (Your) we could (Up) racially profile (High)
Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and hoe down (ohhhhhh)
Plus I got a whole city to hold down (ohhhhhh)
From the bottom to the top
So only place to go down
[Chorus 2nd verse]
[Freeway]
Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R
Turn y'all rap niggaz into two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
My God, two words, no guns, break arms
Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
Free...young bars, fresh men of the Roc
Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
and broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
Have you screamin out four words ""Send for the Lord""
Two words, Freeway's slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad..

Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When the dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
With so much personality, what do you want from me?
I could be by myself and enjoy the company
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melissa Ford
Ninety-four I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin and we all outdoors
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side, Lakeshore Drive
And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest
Where you at? The whole city behind us
[Chorus: Kanye West]
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Where you at? The whole city behind us
[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It ain't nuttin to it but to do it! I came here
to shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it! And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Out West they still bangin, up top it's really gully
Down South we get buck and turn hearts to Silly Putty
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
Big city bright lights - and many pity cause we like fights
May be long days but it's fright nights
Living out the night life - and people asking 'Where You At?'
Not the club; I stay in the get right!
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
Where if somebody moves then somebody gets hurt!
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: The Game]
It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin collar
'Nuff Impalas in to get holla
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
'Where You At?' It ain't a problem to get it there by tomorrow
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
To all the Y.G.'s in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every colour like Ice-T
I might be the city of Compton's right knee
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
Not to mention I am Dr. Dre christened on behalf
of Luda and Kan-Yeezie, I'm gon' breathe easy

Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed

If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me
[Kendrick Lamar]
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience, one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
[Bridge]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time

They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
[Bridge] + [Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last..
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city,
You got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city,
you started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city,
you, you got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
These days, all I do is
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in a zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city

These are my one St Thomas flows
Me and my niggas and some madonna hoes
That look just like virgins
But trust they down to go
Discussin' life and all our common goals
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll
Look how the champagne diamonds flow
Find dining, pour another another glass when the wine is low
Im in the crib stackin' money from here to the ceilin'
Whatever it is I got is clearly appealin'
These other rappers gettin' at it very you feelin
I hope you feel it in your soul spiritual healin'
Take a look at yourself the mirror's revealin'
If you ain't got it you ain't got it the theory is brilliant
People ask how music is goin' I heard it pays
I just came off makin' 2 million in 30 days
Damn I guess it does what the message was
Sometimes I feel I be spendin' my money just because
But weezy I'm just out here reppin' us
Till I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin' us
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics
Kush got the room smellin' like teen spirit
I asked kindly if no-one out here would bring there feet up
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader
I fly private so no-one tells me to bring my seat up
And book a suite when me and your favorite singer meet up
Who you like, tell me who it is
Imma make sure that that women is the next one on my list
I should call it a night but fuck it i can't resist
This one is for all my niggas from my city tryin' to diss
Without a response from me you really fail to exist
And I love to see you fail that feelin' there is the shit
I swear, aghh pussy nigga get your bread up
Enjoy the seat that the steward just forced your ass to let up
Why your scary ass lookin' down pick your head up
No-one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous gettup
With nose plugs in now I can smell a set up
So your just wastin your time your just only makin me better
Yeah I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff
Chasin' cash that's my brother from the surf club
Damn that nigga always kept it so hood
Back when we would smoke good
At the oakwoods
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about
Scared for the first time everything has clicked
What if I dont really do the numbers they predict
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked
To write a chapter in history this shit has got me sick
But if I really do it dont expect to get a split
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect you all to get
Im nervous but I'm about to kill it cause they about to let the realist team in
Throwin up in a huddle nigga Willie beamin
Were still throwin touchdown passes
And tore his frame glasses
Hopin that someone catch it
People say that oh drake we started to miss it
But they need to be a little more specific
Man is this what yall want?
And my best chris tucker impression
Ducking your questions
Fuck your suggestions
Money gets all of my love and affection
Cars all black like the cover of essence
I'm allergic to comin in second
But I never sneeze
Nigga YMOE nigga yeeah
Uh, yeah, this want yall want
Octobers Very Own
Young Money
ATF
Thank me later in this bitch wasssup
Free Weezy in this bitch wasup
June 15th in this bitch wasup

Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm having a good time, they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the yougest nigga doing it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel, everytime
She ain't trying to pop that shit for pimp okay well never mind,
I I I tried to told you, Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet saying you should quit, cars saying fuck ya life
Okay now we outta here
Toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up
I got the voodoo for you bitches
I'm busy getting rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much
I never ever trip
Just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans, so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga this is what I does
[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinon doesn't count,
We the only thing that matters [oooh]
So we do it how we do it

Cause I don't really know who Imma lose this year [oooh]
Man I love my team

Yo, Drizzy sayin' get her Imma get her
I get the kind of money that make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait wait fixate!
Which bitch you know made a million off a mixtape?
That was just a keep sake
Bought the president the Louis presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the Hawks I ain't talking about the Peach state
Man for Petes sake scratch that, sweepstakes [hahahaha]
Fuck I look like hoe
I look like yes and you look like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed.
I'm on a diet but I'm doing donuts in a six speed
M M M6 from a M2
I see a lot of rap bitches on a menu
But I collect 100 thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team
Young Money till the death of me
[Chorus: Drake]
I'm about whatever man
Fuck what they be talking about,
They opinon doesn't count,

It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with
So then I gotta hide, what im feelin inside
So you still think im confident and damn
Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedastal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like im in crazy competition with the past
This why I gotta ask, is anything im doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
is anything im doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

This here is something personal
Highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledege is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide, and put mistakes aside
So I don't ever question you and damn
I cant even find, the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself, but ima couple steps behind
This why I gotta ask, is anything im doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
is anything im doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new

Is anything im doing brand new(6x)
Is everything im doing too late(6x)

If you was in a pine box
I would surely break the lock
I'd jump right in and fall asleep
Cause you are the death of me
[Kendrick Lamar]
Looking in the mirror I'm embarrassed
I'm feeling like a suicidal terrorist
React like an infant whenever you are mentioned
Mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
I'm in the matter of man arm wrestling
Hands I was dealt when I said the music business was all I needed
When I got it I was greeted by an alien
That said last year that she slept with a Canadian
That gave him an addiction that would keep him in Mercedes Benz
Bright lights and Rihanna as a lady friend
My vice is similar women love when you're my type
And you're winning from everything that your palm write
Put her in the Palms Hotel, sin city
Devil in a dress, Platinum Chanel
Live the ambiance all cause the audience, one day said I would do it
So instead of a verse being read
I'mma go and get some head off the strength of my music
I tell a bad bitch your ass too fat
Capitalize That, and your weave look good with the Indian tracks
Tracking device on your used 5 series
I don't call back just blame it on your Canadian
The same day we say were in the area cruisin' in Toronto, hit me on the cellular
Thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers I know
Sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
A white waitress on standby when we need her
A black Maybach, 40 pulled up Jeep
No doors all that nigga was missing was Aaliyah
Felt like the initiation, a reality living in the matrix
We talk casually about the industry
And how the women be the taste makers for the shit we making
Then he said that he was the same age as.. myself
And it didn't help cause it made me even more rude an impatient
So blame it on Mr. OVOXO, the reason why I'm breathing all the vanity I know
The reason why my best friend said she love me more than life
But I live a double life and need to let her go
The reason why, the highlight was when he said:
You belong to the people when you outside
So dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
And bury yourself alive, then I died

Yeah
I remember me and, me and D used to talk about this kind of stuff all the time, like
What it's gonna be like when you get closer to your dreams
I didn't know much then, but
I can probably tell you a lil somethin' now
Mr. Big Dreams no tolerance
Cut you at the house and haven't hollered since
Get bored quickly
He stay grown
So the p-a-tron had to get poured quickly
Ex girl strippin', I can't stop her
New girl trippin' but I can't drop her
Cause I need somethin' to balance out the fact
That it's hard to find a woman when you talented and black
When you hollerin' at labels and they silencin' you back
Cause you fail to thoroughly discuss some violence in ya track well
Gunshot for the young yacht owner
See there's everybody else then there's one top loner
First place is often the worst place
But fuck it I love it here
I call it my birthplace
Whenever I walk in they makin' the worst face
Surrounded by Filipinos I think of the worst case
Watch chrome green diamonds I call it the earth face
I'm gettin' ya cake I tell you how ya dessert taste
I get a dessert plate
Y'all eat pedigree as ya meal
I've been Urkel for some years
It's better bein' Jaleel
Though I rock lean snap
It's better bein' this real
It's better drivin' a car with the letter B in the wheel
Seat back
Light sayin' tank on E
I got the drank on me
You better bank on me
To be the one and only nigga that you ain't gon' see
In the club with a model spillin' dranks on me
Nah
Gimme 20 in the tank on 3
I'm in the Range bumpin' Keyshia Cole
Singin' off-key like (vocalizes)
I'mma spare y'all
Why you wanna judge me
I don't ever compare y'all
The city is mine
I know it because I'm there y'all
It ain't even started I'm really tryna prepare y'all
Spring 07
Second quarter I'm droppin'
With or without a label man I'm committed to poppin'
And take over the summer
Tour to tour hoppin'
I'mma meet a lot of women I'mma do a lot of shoppin'
Really no other option
Spend a lot of money just to make it back
Anybody I dissed in a song I don't take it back
Same rappers that's all in ya face sayin' Drake is whack
Are checkin' my availability just to make a track
I promise mama
I'mma do it cause I know I put you through it (I know I put you through it baby)
And I just want you to sit around with ya friends at the dinner table and say ""my baby's famous and I knew it""
And it wasn't nothin' to it
I'm drawin' and drawin' till the pen was out of fluid
The ballpoint run out
Then all joints come out classic
Rappers are fake we can all point one out
[Drake Talking]
Yeah
I'd like to introduce you to the first lady of the ATF
Closer to my dreams (Miss Andrina Mill)
I'm gettin' higher
Yeah (Yeah man)
I feel it in my sleep (Sing it to 'em baby)
I said I'm gettin' higher
Yeah
And closer to my dreams
Whoa
Sometimes it feels like I'll never move on
Closer to my dreams
Look
I took a plane to Hawaii with D
And we was trippin' off of the speed at which life progress
From meetin' Trey in Atlanta to doin' a cameo in his video has made everything right with ex (Songz)
I got too many records and not enough shows
Too many rappers and not enough-
Well
You can fill the blank in
They tryna be the best
Just tryna place in the rankin'
They can't
Play pen drop out
The gray ten drop out
Summer 05 with the gray Benz drop out
Charcoal charger
Racin' through back streets
On my Craig David shit the awful dodger
Showed her I'mma
I told her I'mma
Bout to get my run-on so hold the commas
Times changed now I'm older mama
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama
And that's the realest shit I ever wrote
A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note
And hi, haters
I'm back off of hiatus
How ya album doin'?
I'm gettin' cake off of my latest
Anticipated like the iPhone
Respected in any city that I roam
Summertime, wintertime, dinnertime, anytime
Bet I am the nigga in my town when I arrive home
(Yeah, one more time before we turn out the lights ladies and gentlemen.)
Closer to my dreams..
I'm getting higher, yeah
How I feel it in my sleep.
I said I'm getting higher, yeah.
And closer to my dreams (woahh woah woahh)
Sometimes it feels like I'll never go on, closer to my dreams..

Shut the lights off
Let the mind work ya know
I like to ummm
I like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody
Yes I call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments.
Deceiving you are the reason that
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season
So I guess that makes u aunt Viv
Until u take from me till the point that u can't give.
And when I see u out I pass by it's offensive
But what u expect tho
Kinda direct yo
Cuhz all that dolce and gabana stuff was expensive
I told ya
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her
So I was just tryna upgrade you
I ain't ya understudy that tryna upstage you
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you
Crown you
Get to know the people that surround you
Funny to think that I woulda white downed you
Now we sit around the studio and clown you
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
Deceiving you are the reason that
My niggas cold in November seems like it's freezing
And I fit every stereotype that ya'll believe in
Cuhz when I say I'm serious you played u only see them
I plan a trip to the tropics that you missed
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed
And in a couple of years you'll be thirsty
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama
And ya daughters getting grown mama
And me I'm just here workin waitin patient
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama
Cuhz I don't really wanna fight no more
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more
Now I'm losin a feeling
U losin appealing
U need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
My first reaction was dead girl
How did I swing you?
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to
But u was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew
Unaware you was outta state doin ya thing to
Sayin to my self u deceiving
You r the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need
And fact I know you always be lyin when u be leavin
Goin to visit family promise me u ain't cheatin
A sure thing just might fail you
Women often conduct themselves just like males do
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that u a soft nigga
How u think cuddling with is cute
They laugh at how u think u last when u really don't
And make u think u get the ass when u really don't
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin it
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin it
So sign your name on a pre-nub and in initials
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip
I can't forget that quick
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving)
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
[Drake talking]
Feel like uh
I feel like we back man (yeah)
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know
If ya'll females would pull it together
Maybe we would have something better to talk about

When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change
[Hook]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
Cause you say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say I love you too
But I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
I need someone different
You know it, oh ho, you know it
Oh ho, you know it, we both know it
Something's been missing
You know it, oh ho, she knows it
Oh ho, I know it, we all know it
I need someone different
(Oh ho, oh ho)
[Verse 2]
We live in a generation of not being in love, and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else

Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?
I can't believe it
Don't you have a man? (Don't you GOT a man?)
It's alllll-right with me, my girl
We can do anything
[Drake]
Why you over there lookin at me?
Why your man stand-in right beside ya?
The temporary happiness he might provide ya
but you know and I know, that nobody gon do ya like me
Tryna say you like a {?} sight
I know that I feel a bit slowly, I'm kinda like,
""I'on't really wanna hit this girl""
and so she want this chef stick like Napoleon Dynamite
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit
They don't wanna cut it, they wanna wrap it and cuddle with
Consequences keep weighin me down
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...
[Chorus, sans ""we""]
[Rapper Big Pooh]
Look...we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling
You some +Getback+ for your man mistreat thing
But that was then, you know some hush-hush
I ain't never really see a future in us
Plus your man still there, let's be fair
You'll do the same things to me
My feelings never did go past, some late night smash
I'on't wanna take the place of he!
Late night's 85 South on my way to the crib
and somebody got a song for me
I already know what you about, cause I been the other man
and you NOT gonna trap me witcha silly lil plan
It's my bad, shoulda chose a wo-man
but I'm in the mix with this lil' girl playin
I'm sayin, you need to do what you do
I'm NOT tryna take it any further with you, C'MON
[Chorus]
[Phonte]
Uh...uh...I met her at the bar sippin on Patron
And now it's been three years off and on
Cause the same page, we are rarely off and on
Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (c'mon)
We lost contact like {?} shalom
But regained it while she was buildin her house a home
wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right
It just proves that, she don't know what to do wit her life
Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries
One minute she mad at me, next minute it's all good
and I'm in her body like Grey's Anatomy
I don't understand why God sent me to you
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (uh)
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you
I think to myself, ""Damn, if only her nigga knew"", what?
{*chuckles*} yeah..
[Chorus]
[Dwele - Outro]
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?)
Why are you trying to be my girl?

And girls are beautiful until they want a hand out

I'll be on the phone with a bitch that you will never know
So you can son me never... I don't get bitter... I just get better
And a verse is just a verse for me
I keep it generic and these niggas take it personally
If I was in a room and someone yelled... hey bitches
I would never turn around... cause I just don't fit the description
But that's just me though...
But don't mind him girl... that's just freako
Please don't cuss girl... that don't suit you
His name 40 and his name future
Oliver's here and you know me ho
I'm the cash cow front man of o.v.o.
I am not doin features now... no means no
And the hate starts building the more we grow
Damn shame am I overexpressin the game
Should I hold back on addressin the lane
Because they becoming obsessed with my name
I'm tranna clean up my mess and explain
And boy you know my progression insane
My engineer is the best in the game
And every since I've been messing with wayne
People getting jealous I can see they expressions have changed
They seemed to love me when this shit was goin nowhere
And now they got a bunch of feelings that they won't share
They just give me the fuck it I'm broke stare
Drake was at the club and he bald like no hair
Living life from a whole different angle
Only see the road through the wings of an angel
And I can see the heart on your sleeve... and I know this shit is hard to believe
You gone have to get over it... and all you talkin ass niggas get over it
And all you people that be hating get over it... and all you women that I fucked get over it
And yea I'm turning 22 get over it... you know you gotta hear my records get over it
My whole team getting rich get over it... I got the city on my back get over it
Get over it get over it

I'm sitting outside man I'm right in the truck
Bags packed, pack of black and milds lighting 'em up
I'm looking down on these niggas while inviting 'em up
I'd like to know the reasoning behind subliminals,
like who told them to mention me?
I am elavated homie, you are elementary
Tellin' 'em you sellin' dope and never sold a century
Saying you get denied off your entry exam
You get flow and you done fo'
Converse in one verse,
about you fraud niggas that shoot never and run first
And ask Juicy if I Stay Fly
On the cellphone, and got a ten on the other end like an eight by
Six two and they tell me you ye' high
They can't but they try, still get offended if I don't say hi
Me it's kinda gay if I'm saying hi to like eight guys
So I just walk past and keep it cool till the hate dies
I do nothing that would offend these cats
But I wish I had a spot where I could send these cats
Like here, sit on this island man and pen these raps
Bust them shots, pretend you trap, do whatever man
Long as you never find your way home I'm cool wit it
I left you a shovel there, you know what to do wit it
I never bust a gun, I'm Mister C-T-V
At least, I'm not Mister Dick Riding C-T-E
Rappers believe me, I'm cuttin' records with Jody Breezy
And that nigga would even admit that you flowin' cheesy
Slow your roll this ain't a diss song,
This song, will let you know I'm not the one to pick on
White with the yellow, the over easy I'm a swiss on
Only got a couple girls that I'm willing to kiss on
With the rest I turn the charm that they cannot resist on
If they wanna smoke they get they purple gooded twist on
But I can't call it, maybe you mad cause you fellas lookin' celibate
Two things that you are though is jealous and irrelevant uh
And I'm official, what's officially true
Is callin' names would only be beneficial to you
I just tiring you niggas, ya'll the missioning crew
I know a response is something that you itchin' to do
And YOU? you're smaller to me then a thumb tack
Music enjoy it, well I'm just tryna bring the fun back
But you makin' out all these dumb tracks, ya LL sixteens
Cause I listen to them and I don't call it come BACK
It's more like a shame or disgrace,
Considering I'm the one that you aim to displace
But you the one I blame in this case
Without you to experience much of that desired fame at this rate
Your awkward ass singles, the lamest mixtapes
And this is what's makin' you say you came to get Drake
And I'm thinkin' the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, uh
I'm thinkin' the hood's right for you
The sun shines on my career it's goodnight for you, nigga

Used to always stay at home, be a good girl

Gotta do what I gotta do
[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel, and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told them don't even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love it
And right after texting, told her I'm faded
She asked
What have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fucking wit' ya
Damn, is it the fall
Time for me to revisit the past
It's women to call
There's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions
Like:
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fucked your girl, is it true?
You getting money? You think them niggas you with is with you?
And I say
(And I say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, all right
(And we say) Hell yeah
Hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right
Fuckin' right, damn right
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
So much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath until my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch ,if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met, later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive, and she was sober
I gave her pills
She started confessing and started undressing
And ask me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me, asking for closure
Damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me
I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me
And she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same
And I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation but
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom confusing me with questions like

Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
so someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just say the cost of living
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
and me falling and landing in love shouldn't happen
because everythings easier to get into than get out off
but someone show me to the owner of this city
because the owners always seem to be the only people with me

You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for
Anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone
[Lil Wayne]
Oooh shit,
Muthafucker God Damn
Kicking bitches out the Condo like pam
Getting money everyday I'ma ground hog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man I swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off
Erghhhh, thats nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I aint asthmatic
James Bain cologne, honey I put on
Make em run and tell your friends like a marathon
Voice baritone haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan
I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To women I condone better write me when I'm gone
No I'm not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uhh, I'm a love machine
And I wont work for nobody but you
It's only me and her because the Bugatti coupe
Its blood gang slam but I party with Snoop
I aint lying I shoot
You don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegatable like you lining soup
And when I'm in the booth, shit the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles, I am a group
Damn, I'll be gone till November
Fuck it I aint trippin, I know Drizzy gon' kill em'
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim
Mama say it if the rules aint bent don't bend em'
Real nigga talking
Shut the fuck up hoe
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, wattup zoe
Weezy F Baby and the F is for Front do'
Cause that's where I bring it,
Soo wu if you bang it, mothafucka
[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah girl it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah, that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for
Anything you down for
I know things have changed
Know I used to be around more
But you should miss a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone

Least you coulda done is gone an give me a warning
I don't regret like this
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning
Saying, this just ain't my style
You can't say you're happy either
You don't even smile, for me
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to (???)
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to (???)
When you decided to knock on my door
Did you remember what happened before
The look on your face said you were expecting more
But some things look better inside of the store
[Chorus:]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to (???)
Let's call the whole thing off
We used to (???)
Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But, ion really feel that
I just really wanna turn the wheels back
Give you all ya sweaters and ya heels back
Convince you that time will heal that
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue
I swear everytime I call
You jus tell me how I don't call you
Why you do that... do that... do that
Yeah
[Chorus:]
Did you agree, we should let it be
And did you agree, it's a must,
Let's call the whole thing off

Hands down
I'm too proud, for love
But with eyes shut
It's you I'm thinking of
[Drake]
But how we move from A to B it can't be up to me
Cause you don't know
Who I was before you
Basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah
Oh oho
But your on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Oh oho
But maybe in time, in time, in time
I'll tell you
[Chorus:]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit, a little bit in love with you
Oh oho
[Drake]
I know you don't break their hearts
But it's you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I they know I ah ah ah
[Lykke Li]
I would do it
Push a button
Pull a trigger
Climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff
Cause you know baby I love you love you
A little bit
I would do it
You'd say it
You'd mean it
I would let you do it
It was you and I and I only
Ha hm
I think I'm a little bit
Little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit
Little bit
In lalalala love with me
[Drake]
I hope they never find out
What they already know, know, know
As soon as it's official
We'll have to let it go, go, go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You'll get teased for many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures on
Both hearts beat like a metronon
Both n'sync like a justin song
Feels so right but it's just soo wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
Where niggas said I know, tryna talk my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just get jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheating on her ass
With a girl that I know yeah tell her all that, that
And as for you I think I know your the one
The closest I've come
I'm probably...
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit
A little bit
A little bit
A little bit in love with you
Oh oho
Lalalala love with me
Oh oho, oh oho

"474","https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/drake/look_what_youve_done-lyrics-1370439.html","drake","Look What You've Done ","[Verse 1]
It's like ?09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue about spending money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father -- my one button, you push it
Now it's ""Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat!""
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry
You love me, and I love you, and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it weren't so bad
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we'll probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinking of signing me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son -- man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl, we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it
[Hook]
This shit real, should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When you're stressed out and you need something, I got you
Look what you've done, look what you've done
[Verse 2]
It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love, just when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now -- he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid
Damn, boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid but
It still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new, shit
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting, I'm more in touch with the music
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far
Talked from me to you, got from me you
You tossed the keys and loaned me your car
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid going through life
So worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where
I'd really be without that, it worked out man
You deserve it
[Hook]
[Drake's Grandmother]
Hi Aubrey, I'm here sitting with my son having a little talk
And he knows how to get in touch with you now
To let you know how grateful I am for your help
In keeping me in this, in this comfortably
All I can say Aubrey, is I remember the good times we had together
And the times I used to look after you
And I still have wonderful feelings about that
So God bless you, and I hope i'll see you...

All we wanted was opportunity
(Just Blaze!) Lord knows!
[Verse 1: Drake]
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?
So I'm going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all
But that's just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that I'm ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Hefner and Jordan my only role models
That's why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But it's whatever if somebody wan' make it a thing
I'm more concerned what niggas thinkin' about Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake, a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs. Fields; they're making the cookie stretch
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well
Stunt like I'm working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit, record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin' team
Matchin' Rollies for real, matchin' Rovers for real
Places they say they've been, we've actually going for real
I'm really killin' shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping
I'm going trigga happy just to see my niggas happy
Mixtape legend, underground kings
Lookin' for the right way to do the wrong things
With my new bitch that's living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga, lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era
In a time where it's recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though, they know I run that
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever
I change rap forever, the game back together, yeah
YM, I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished
I'm hearing all of the jokes, I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin' emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy
Know that I don't make music for niggas who don't get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy, I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin' spooky
Very, very scary, like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
That's why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga, for real
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
You know I love this
YOLO, you only live once
I'm going so hard my nigga, I swear homie
Everyday is another opportunity to reach that goal
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I fell in love with the pen, started fucking the ink
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper
Destined for greatness, but got a place in Jamaica
Villa on the water with the wonderful views
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews
Went and got a yacht, I'm talkin' Carnival cruise
And these niggas talking like hoes, they mad they not in my shoes
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar
Every bi-week, shit, I'm bound to buy a car
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R
Headlights flicking, looking like a falling star
Everyday them hammers bang, whipping yay like Anna Mae
I run the game but the ladies think I'm running game
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate
Rozay and Drake, I'm getting cake, nothing short of great

I got a certain lust for life, and as it stands
Everything is going as right, as it can
They tryin to shoot down my flight, before it lands... before it lands
But you can miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish ya'll would fall back
But gettin rich suppose to solve that
And these days women make office and who the hell am I to say [no, no, no]
My ex sendin late night text cause she don't know how to let [go, go, go]
She in love
And as for them pretty light skinned models standin in the cold aw yea they with us
Let them girls in for a drink
And I'm all in they ear
Saying she should be the one I see, everytime, that I'm here
But when I'm not really even here
Black surburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old hand prints on it
But I'm a be the one to pour cement on it
Uh, and start over
And show up in the mars yellin Tux I don't really give a fuck and we're only getting older
So what I tend to do is think of today as the past
It's funny when you're coming in first but you hope that you're last [you just hope that it lasts]
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up in the air for her
Throw your one's up in the air
Throw your one's up

Hello? Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good.. you still working?
Tonight, right now? Did I go out? Yeah I went out
I went.. I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit.. wine or water
You said something about a cold drink?
I don't know, I'm delirious..
[Verse 1]
Cups of the Rose, bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home, I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinking so much that I'mma call her anyway and say
[Hook]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up, I know he's not around

(Are you drunk right now?)
I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO, all my people been here
I see all of her friends here guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning, what you doing that's so important?
I've been drinking so much that I'mma call you anyway and say

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sitting talking 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of making
Monsters outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad, but shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just calling cause they were just leaving
Talk to me please don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's living off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week: I'll explain
Having a hard time adjusting to fame
Sprite and that mixed up, I've been talking crazy, girl
I'm lucky that you picked up, lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on, ""Well I'm sorry""
[Bridge]
[Interlude]
You're not going to come?
Guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back

Ohhhhhh, she could be good for me
Ohhh, that's when you text me
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine
And the fact she's right here with me
She's starin in my face, somethin had to change

I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
you too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I can teach you how to speak my language Rosetta stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
got to go thriller Mike Jackson on these n'ggas
all I need is a fucking red jackets with some zippers
super good smidoke a package of the swishas
I did it over night, it couldn't happen any quicker

so they tell me that they love me I know better than that it's just game
it's just what comes from fame
and I'm ready for that I'm just saying
I really can't complain, everything is kosher
two thumbs up, ebert and roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
but I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
so I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
can you see me can you see me get your visine on
y'all just do not fit the picture
turn your widescreen on
if you thinking Imma quit before I die dream on
man they treat me like a legend

I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body...
[Verse 1]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
Fuck it, I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
Fuck it, I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing the field, nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again?
Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
It's been that way from the beginning
I just been playing, I ain't even even notice I was winning
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas that's doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfucking funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got 10 years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Let Me Show You What It Is
I Was Birthed Up Top But Was Raised At The Bottom Of The Map
Where The Girls Are Thick
And The Hottest Nigga Rap
If You Lookin For That Good Then We Got It In The Trap
Like Oo Wee Take Em From White Sneaks To Louie
This Metaphor Might Sound A Lil Confusing But Y'all Dont Reall Know Me If You Know Me
I Done Come A Long Way From The Days Inn And Other Hotels That I Stayed In
I Took My Life Style From Meediocure To Good And Now Its Here Sittin At Amazing
Girls Tryna Sell Whole Lobby Of Us
Hear Em All Screamin And Its Probably Us
But I Cant Blame Females. Females Can't Really Ignore Something Thats Obvious
What You Really Expect When I Strutt Through Town
Two Or Three Days I Shut You Down
Chillin With The Homie Trey Songz You Can Call Him The Prince
He Rep 2 Up 2 Down
Anyone I Know Get Used To Me Im Far From The Man That I Used To Be
And I Dont Ever Really Kick Game I Know You Find It Impressing
Whenever Your Introduced To Me
Cuz Im A Good Dude Take Pride In That
Need Good Lovin I'll Provide In That
Understand That Im World Wide You Can Get It How You Want Wherever You Be Residin At
Cuz I Do Things From The M-Town To The Uk And From Spain Back Out To Texas
This Albums For My Fans But Yo This Hook Is For Me Ex's
[Chorus: Trey]
This One Is For You Girl

You Only Show Your Face Cuz You Know That Im A Star Girl
But Your Tryna Make It

I Think I Made It
Ladies Make Some Noise If You Wanna Be My Replacement Girl.
[Verse 2: Trey]
Aint You Never A Yougin So Fly
Lookin For Someone Your Type
I Done Left Behind The Love Of My Life
Tryna To Find Another One Tonight
And If It's You Baby Let Yourself Be Seen

From The Moment That She Get Picked Up For Some Take Out
Until They Slip Up And They Brake Out
But It's Another Story Over Here At Drake's House
Cuz Im Dripped Up And Im Drapped Out
And Im Lean Back Scopin
Lookin For A Women That I Should Wife
Who Got Just The Right Amount Of Loyalty But Still Anticipates Us Livin The Good Lif
We L.A. , V.A., N.Y., T.O.

In Them Fur Hoods And That Deep Snow
We Have Breakfast In The Bedroom Then Brake Bread Downstairs In The Basement
And Since Jay And Kellz Aint Doin The Thang No More Guess Me And The Boy Songz The Replacement
[Chorus: Trey]

Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if we acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I don't have the heart to give these
Bitch ass niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertaining as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back
But it's hard to think of them polite flows
Mr. fano poloto suits on your night clothes
And jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full
Now this shits just been light pole
Always said I'd say it all on the right track
But in this game u only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets
Showing you the basics
I can't live and hold the camara
Someone gotta tape dis
I make hits and like a bitch
Just married I ain't miss
24 hours from greatness
I'm that close to
Don't ever forget the moment
You began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los angeles, cabanas or atlanta south
Watchin home shows
Embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarased
To put my phantom out
So I park about 5 houses down
She said I shouldn't have until I have the crown
But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is and counts in the minus
But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what I'm working with is timeless
And promoters trying to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I can't imagine how
Cause I just see my ex-girl
Standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear
We from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
I've always been something dat these lables can't buy
Especially if they tryin to take a peice of my soul
And still b only tellin tales 'damn drake fly'
And he just be like 'silly mother fucker I know'
That was your bad
How could you pass up on em?
He just take the records
And he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did pole
At least they try to
And that's what happens
When you spitting what's inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you
However they decide to naww
Before they told me to do me
And don't listen to anybody that knew me
Cause who of known me would
Mean that there's a new me
And if you think I've changed in the slightest
Could of fooled me
Baa into my city I'm da 2-3
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and is not because I'm lazy
I'm just not the social type
And campus life is crazy understand
I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest versus down at cabo
So if you find a blackberry with the sides scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit
I'm gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in their Verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said cause it's ye shit you better kill
And I think it's got them making of a legend feel
Problem with these other niggas they
Ain't never real
Yea... that's all I can say

And when I leave,
I always come right back here,
The young spit it and everybody in rap fear,
A lot of ya'll still soundin like last year,
The game needs change and I'm the mof***ing cashier,
Nickels for my thoughts,
Dimes in my bed,
Quarters of the kush,
Ain't the limes in my head,
Take my verses too serious ya hate me,
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture no HD,
Yeah,
I want it all,
That's why I strive for it,
Diss me and you'll never hear a reply for it,
Any awards show or party I'll get fly for it,

Yeah,
I want things to go my way,
But as of late a lot of sh** been goin sideways,
And my mother tried to runaway from home,
But I left somethin in the car so I caught her in the driveway,
And she cried to me so I cried too,
And my stomach was soakin wet,
She only 5'2,
And 48 hours all before I showed up,
And brought a thousand dollas worth of drinks and got poured up,
Damn my reality just set in,
And even when the phantoms leased them hoes wanna get in,
I do a lot of things,
Hopin I neva have to fit in,
So tryin to keep up with my programs is like a dead end,
My girl love me but f*** it my heart beat slow,
And right now the tour bus is lookin like a freak show,
And life change for us every single week,
So its good,
But I know this ain't the peak though
Cause I want...

Wise words from a decent man,
Back when I was tryin to put a ring on alicia hand,
This lost boy got fly without peter pan,
And my delivery just got me buzzin like the pizza man,
In person I am everything and more,
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before,
But inside I'm treadin waters steady tryin to swim ashore,
I'm on a shoppin spree to get whateva is in store,
Just call me shop and bag drizzy,
And call me mr.damn he ain't copin that is he?
And fans of these freshman is about to get iffy,
While this youngin that you doubtin is about to get busy,
I'm a kill it I promise this I know you mad,
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads,
To big homie use a flash if you must,
And I swear I ain't askin for much
All I want is

It's like I know what I got to say,
I just don't know how to say it to you
[Lil Wayne:]
Pardon the swag,
But bi***es cartate,
Long bread I don't eat shortcake,
How come I can't,
Miss a woman like I can't miss courtdates,
Cheese,
But shes not in this portrait,
Lifes fine but I dont portray,
I'm on the other side but it is a short gate,
I don't want the glow,
I want the glory,
And I'm a f*** the world,
But this is just foreplay,
Tired of hearing bullsh**,
Bring her on to cowsh**,
Havent met a smell that's stinkier than ? sh**,
That's word to toronto,
So high up I got birds in the condo,
Ain't that a female dog,
Ask her who I am to her,
And she yell god,
Weezy baby i go real hard,
No further details boy

uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay,
You could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go
my hollow from my heart is hard to follow
lately I've been drinking like there's a message in a bottle
aloha's to women with no ties
to men that I know well
that way there are no lies
you could thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
I'm on the brink of influential
I'm here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch,
what a year for you niggas
it's December 31st and we in Miami just meditating
you got the resolutions, we just got reservations
living out a dream, it feels like I stayed up
and we just wanna party, patron straight up
fuck that old shit, I'm on new things
OVO clique, Red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all, half was never the agreement
who'd thought the route we chose would ever end up this scenic
I could relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognise that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with Mike but gotta AI him for your survival
damn, I swear sports and music are so synonomous
'cause we wanna be them and they wanna be us
yeah so on behalf of the demanded
and the entertainment that you take for granted
you could thank me now...
and oh my goodness you're welcome
you're welcome
at this point me is who I'm trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
cause they think that I can help them get back to where they fell from
but drink up because everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that I came with, they good for life
yeah, thats how you know it's going down
in case another chance never comes around...
You could thank me now
uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay,
You could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go
Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women
I think I have a chance at love but knowing me I miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones I used to hit her friends now
that make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
but do I ever come up in discussion over double pump latte's
and low fat muffin's, do I?
Or is missing what we had outta the question
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroe's who's there before it all
I guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons or focus on your pro's
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow
into women that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allow
where are they all now
I know there somewhere watching so I'm trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning
you'll find it next to me
and tell me I'm the highest, guess we finally get to see
I'm feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
they say that doors open up as soon as you find the missing key
it's probably why I'm in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it
I'm sorry, poolside drinking
margharita rounds
shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
I'm the Black Sheep, but Chris Farley wears the crown
and I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down
I'm in the world where things are taken, never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while I'm still here in this position...
You could thank me now
uh, go 'head
Thank Me Later yeah I know what I said
but later doesn't always come so instead
it's okay,
You could thank me now
uhh, yeah, well alright, here I go

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekends here started it right, even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing
[Bridge]
Houston girls, love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls, love the way it goes down
Vegas girls, love the way it goes down
[Hook]
But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
We musta been here before, cause girl you're fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but won't find
You musta done this before, this can't be your first time
[Verse 2]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other
[Bridge] + [Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Cause to her I'm just a rapper, and soon she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wanna be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her, and she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I won't know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last..
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Andre 3000]
Shower her with dollar tips
Shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name
You throw the ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote ""bad bitches"" work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in the corner
Like a lab rat nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
We look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim
We lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind
Cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in the Boise state
Can't see her play or the team, cuz
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't
Souls will later on say to them ""that ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what you can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place I can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you baby
Someone like you, more like someone unlike you
Or someone that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell ""Girl, that shit crazy!""
Oh what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy
Please be careful: bitches got the rabies

You won't feel me until everybody
Say they love you, but it's not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered
Then forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriend's ass getting
Thicker than the plot does
And when you forget it, that's when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions
About all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce
That shit's right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you, it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
It's feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Intead of getting a pat down, they just keep on
Saying that they feel you, nigga
[Hook: The Weeknd]
I've been faded too long
[Verse 2]
You won't feel me til you want it
So bad you tell yourself you're in it
And tell the world around you
That your paperwork is finished
And steal your mother's debit cards
So you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced
Rental cars that ain't tinted
You need a minute? You got it
You know its real when your
Latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life
Apartment 1503: some couches and paintings
When you record with 2 others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night, you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit, you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could beat a nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you, nigga
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I haven't been inside Terminal 1 and 3 in so long
I'm driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year, it's got you asking whats good at home
What's good at home?
The same hoes are still at it, I shoulda known
My young niggas popping M's and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping October's Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties, stitches still showing
Yeah, and she just praying that it heals good
I'm bout to fuck and I'm just praying that it feels good
I really don't know much but, shit, I know a secret
They say more money more problems, my nigga don't believe it
I mean, sure, there's some bills and taxes I'm still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker, season ticketholder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didn't notice
You niggas getting older, I see no threat in Yoda
I'm out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldn't fuck with my freshman floater (flow ta)
Look at that fucking chip on your nephew's shoulder
My sophomore, they was all for it, they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care, nigga

Yeah, never thoughts of suicide I'm too alive
But I still treat it likes it's do or die
Even though dying isn't in the plans
But neither was making it and here I am
In the Presidential -- do you like your new room?
Always presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing moving through the street, got a new condo, move it to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib, goddamn, man, she's beauty and the beast (Lord)
Seems like yesterday that I was up and coming
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothing
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here?
Well fuck let's get it then
[Hook]
I'm trying to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double, you ain't even gotta ask, Ahh
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine
Are you down, are you down? Yeah, you all the way down, everytime
Am I down, am I down? Yeah, I'm all the way down, We'll be fine

Used to make us proud -- we had dreams of getting bigger, man
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga, man
You keep talking that, ""You was this and you had this""
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my motherfucking time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said, ""you're such a dog"", I said, ""you're such a bone.""
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always saying, ""show me some""
But girl you ain't the only one that's trying to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that, and you with that
Then fuck let's get it then
[Hook]
[Birdman]
Yeah! Drizzy, yo turn nigga!
Take Care of the business nigga (shine on these niggas)
Give these niggas the business nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga, fuck em, we don't love em!
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto, stand up for one of the realest Niggas
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit, fellas
OVO YMCMB (believe that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfucking millions like they ain't nothing
Throwin' hundreds, rubber band stacks
That YMCMB shit nigga; flashy lifestyle
One Hundred

Uh, you know you know how the story goes,
You done jock my style, you done stole my flow,
You done seen me out, you gets no hello,
And you wonder why? Man you know you know,
Yeah and you should let them boys know too,
Show them n-ggas every single thing I showed you,
Im here feeling like 50 back in '02, and everybody sayin I'm the man [big mike], so true,
Yeah but what does it take to feel secure?
A place with wooden floors and space to put awards,
A couple of parking spots and maids to do the chores,
The cars you always wanted, the women that you adore,
Well I got it, I got it,
I wonder if id be happy without it, I doubt it,
I try not to really think about it,
I made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted til I'm outted,
Game top bitch, I hope youre proud of us,
King james sh-t watch me throw the powder up,
This old g got my whole suite cloudin up,
But I bet you I be out of time before I'm out of luck,
They aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,
I really hate to say I told you so,
So I bite my tongue but you know you know,
You know you know
You know you know
Uhh, please make your long story shorter,
This time is for the essence for the king of first quarter,
Numbers do the talkin I have nothing for reporters,
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border,
Yeah so you can spare me all the accolades,
Im the reason you can find my city on an atlas page,
Half a million dollars later and my taxes paid,
And I'm still spendin money from my actin days,
Damn, life is such a lovely thing,
Feel the perks that a 7 digit budget bring,
Tell your girlfriend that I can pull some f-ckin strings,
So were courtside when lebron get a f-ckin ring,
Yeah, I bet I be there I be there,
You see that '62 sittin outside? Thats me there,
Im jumpin to the top its my leap year, prepare,
Putting in that overtime I never said it be fair,
Im always left wishin I could have done it in person,
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin,
I got new girls but none of they love is for certain,
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin,
Damn what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust,
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
If it is just to have fun you should see that as a plus,
Especially when I come flyin through the door
And kindly ignore the paparazzi outside and tryin to record,
Why has every woman never dined her before?
Am I the only 23 year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschild's, the Cru's, the 'Caias and the Opuses
Its always nice when youre out with someone that notices,
My condo got that art gallery openness,
Im just really hopin that that isn't what the motive is,
They aint routin for me, they aint clappin for me,
Im only sayin can somebody just be happy for me,
I really hate to say I told you so,
So I bite my tongue but you know you know

So far ahead, these bums is laggin'
See me in that new thing, bums is gaggin'
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up, flatscreen
(Haha) Plasma
Hey Nicki, hey Nicki, asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, Xenocin
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that hoe, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You li'l brag a lot, I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
I ain't into S and M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off, I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turnin', spin, and wheel off
Snap the axel in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollerin' Why, God? He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin' my wad
I ain't finished blowin' it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)
The wo-world is my punchin' bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just choked in traffic
(I-I-I-I-Is) Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
(Ni-ni-ni) Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I-I-I-I hear them mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a stand, still, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' bucked, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy-ass, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
(Manning, Eli!) Ma, ma-ma-ma-ma, Manning, Eli
These bitches callin' me (Manning, Eli)
A-a-a-a-all you li'l faggots can suck it
No home, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep actin' as if
You have the same passion that I have
Yeah, right, still hungry, my ass
You assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids (Eyelash!)
Go take a flyin' leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds class
It's (high class) meets (white trash)
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon

Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
Grown men! Grown men!
Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Pleaaaaaaase
Back to bed! Run along!
Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance

YO, answer this question, class is in session,
tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,
capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,
OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,

I put the heat in vents, man I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin', and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher, what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there will never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as 7 years from now, I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I look down, yes I suppose
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'mma ride I'm with you still the night is young
We keep goin', we go, we go, we go
We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love him
Family ties broken before me, niggas trynna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes I get it, I get it, it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes, the last day he saw me
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment 'til it falls

We wake back up and do it all again
We know, we know, say fuck the world, we ridin' til the end
When all is said and done, look at what we've become
I just want you to know, that I did it for you
Let me make this clear I'm not difficult, I'm just about my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself, and that's a fact
I'd give it all, if I could somehow, just rekindle that
She never understands, why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like, somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've have been sixteen, any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah, is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Yeah we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game, cause you know I only fuck with ballers (yep!)
Them is my type of niggas, shot-callers
I been around the world I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow I'm groovy bitches
And no you're no match for my oozie bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like wetter than jacuzzi bitches
[Chorus:]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that can steal my shine.
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch.
I'm the baddest bitch
The mistress I'm the baddest bitch.
I'm the baddest bitch
Trick-trick-trick please I'm the baddest bitch.
[Verse 2:]
[laughing]
Half a bar just to laugh at em
High school if he ball throw my math at em
And if he want some pussy that's a no-no
I only fuck with bad bitches no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj I'm the talk of the town now.
[Chorus]
Baddest, the baddest, my pussy's the phattest I'm bad.
Bad.
Bad, bad

I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause its too much, and its too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I met the one and your wasting your time
But you waited

Candace, Temby, Lauren, Iesha

It's a celebration (For the ghetto)
It's time, time we (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay
We made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
The Ferarri top down, screaming, Money ain't a thang!
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rap
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that
[Hook]
It's a celebration (For the ghetto)
It's time, time we (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

[Verse 4: Nas]
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
Cause that's where a nigga from murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermuda, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting pop, little not, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just despise your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list with like this, first thing to souther
The difference in p-ssy, white, Black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions
[Hook]
It's a celebration (For the ghetto)
It's time, time we (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)

All these hating naggers ain't got nothing on me.
Honestly I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you lick and roll it you get super OG
Mine is always ? cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies they can't touch me cause I'm floating sky high
I stay nigga-rific you don't need to ask why
You can try and see with your eyes

All these haters mad because I'm so established.
They know I'm a beast, yeah I'm a f**king savage

In my space shuttle and I'm not coming down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't coming back this time.

Yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
The DunDun
Yep, in London
Competition, why yes I would love some
How the f**k they get mad cause they run done.
Mad cause I'm getting money in abundance
Man I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffle bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest
F**k my nemesis
Exclamation just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize, cause you a simple b***h
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple sh*t
And put the iron to your face you old wrinkled b***h
We just had to kill it
We on the radio hotter than a skillet
We in the club making party people holla
Money in the bank we be getting top dollar
I'm a big baller,
You a little smaller
Step up to my level, you need to grow a little taller
I'm shot caller
Get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua
I'm a Rottweiler

Never mind my money, never mind my stacks
Every bitch wanna be me
You can find 'em in Sacks

And if they don't get Nicki, then it just won't be the same
When I'm sitting with Anna, I'm really sitting with Anna
Ain't a metaphor punchline, I'm really sitting with Anna

Ain't a bitch that could do it, not even my impostor
Put these bitches on lock out, where the f-ck is your roster?
I pull up in that new new marinara and pasta

Shake my head, yo, I'm mad
Ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle of nowhere, I just feel so alone

If you need you a look, just put me on your song
But you know it'll cost about six figures long
But you bitches ain't got it, where the f-ck is your budgets?
Flying spurs for hers, me, I'm f-cking above it
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it Casper
But that is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the f-ck am I styling?
When you win against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbating, but I'm feeling myself
Paparazzi is waiting, cause them bitches is stall

Strawberry, apple, cherry even lemon lime.
What you want them B cups or them C cups?
For your ice cream, chocolate or butter P cups?
French vanilla threesomes that come in D cups
They eat each other but otherwise they don't eat much.

You got your fans waitin tell me you ain't 6 feet under
And tell me that you coming back that you just to a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything that was my mistake
In hindsight I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
Cuz it was you who talked me down from jumpin off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
You was the braveheart
You stole wayne heart
You never switched it up
You played the same part
But I needed to grow
And I needed to know
That there were somethings inside of me that I need to show
So I just deaded you
Left you in all black
But damn old nicki
Please call back
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly I really knew
But I'm standing here calling I cant see you
But I am holding you, holding you, holding you to that
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour
Money, fame and power
Cuz if so that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me gettin at them nameless cowards
There was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground, and I was mainstream
I live the life now, that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet them lawyers with me
The money came yea, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was on some stupid shit
But its still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you
Left you in all black

I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
I wish today it will rain all day
Maybe that will kinda make the pain go away
Trying to forgive you for abandoning me
Praying but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got their guns out aiming at me
But I become near when they aiming at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all see blood
They start coming and I start rising
Must be surprising, I'm just summising
Win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher
More fire
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocating everytime it locks me in
Paint they own pictures than they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that can every be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
So we become alive in a time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfucking time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard your nay's become yay's
Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
Get ready for it
I came to win
I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly
To fly

Against me will prosper. And I truly
Believe that my haters are my motivators.

If you could you would get rid of me,
Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.

I am, I'm Still the one to beat.
Ain't in a rush from these streets
I am the streets. I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD!
Carter called, lemme get the car key, you don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly (man man down! ) hit em on a walkie-talkie.
Hit em, hit em knock-knock, tell em let me in. my name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians, or real real bad lesbian.
Hit em wit the Mac, hit em wit the Tec 9, hit em wit the Ruger by the intersex sine.
Hit em wit a Tommy so my niggas call me Pammy and I always the jammy in the trunk or in the lamby
Put my whole burrough on my back and I'm gooda, I don't wanna hear what you would, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up, used to drink water wit a little bit of sugar.
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups, doin the scissor-leg on the mat wit my foot up.
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up.
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner, bitches like nelly and kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter, fuck I look like chompin on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle; I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, louis on the duffle. I'm a bad bitch no muzzle. (no muzzle).
Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different kentae. tell em I'm the ninja,
Weezy is my sensei. so I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter. gimme my chopsticks
I'll have the rap bitches for dinner.
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish ackes
kisses is to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky.
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kinda rocky.

Better yet, like Bubba, know shrimp. but he don't say shit
When the gun on his lip, and I don't say shit put the gun
On my hip. so I don't say shit but the gun on my hip.
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a bitch.

And if ya got money, don't come on my strip

Make you tumble and flip
You fuckin wit me if you fuckin wit Nick
They ain't fuckin wit me ,they ain't fuckin wit Nick
Your girlfriend and she just split
Cuz she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nick
They wonder if he be fuckin Nick, as long as she be fuckin rich
That's why I keep my luggage cuz, I swear yall's a fuckin trip.
Young Money Dungeon, bitch. my swagger is just punching bitch
And I shoot like I'm from over-seas, so call my gun, ""Gunovich""

Fuck you gone do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard.
If you was as real as me you would never
Let another girl sit in yo throne.
I done put the choke on now
They screamin, ""Nicki leave me alone!""
I am, I will, I gots to win.
I'm still lookin around for my
Com-pe-tition. I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go, GO, gooo, GO HARD!

Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were the one
who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
And now the people are talking,
the people are saying that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
The people are talking, the people are saying
that you have been playing my heart like a grand piano
So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
Am I being a fool?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
Cause I keep thinking you were
the one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold-hearted, shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

To have and to hold till death do us part

A couple fake visas cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, f*cking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things
Ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo
And grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
5-year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him
Put him on lock, seat-belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
B*tches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order
I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk
But I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa
I never f*ck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers

Same place where Murda Mace once stood.
Ferrari cars interior all wood.
Now I'm in the club, bottles on me.
Lui Vuitton ? , models on me.
Heavy chains, nuttin' hollow on me.
I'm a star now, all the problems on me.
Shawty lookin' nice so I'm lovin' her.
I Don't care what chew say, I'm cuffin' her.
She's hot, nigga can't get enough of her.
N- champaign, I can't stop touchin' her.
Her pretty eyes is killin' me, her glossy lips is stealin' me.
After the club Ma, we can chill in the V.
Tonight is our night and Ma, I feel free.
Hopped off the boat, I am such a immigrant
Why he get Nicki Minaj tatted on his ligament
Wait, just for the record get wetter than fisherman
Pull up with some 26s up under the Michelins
You know I pop-pop-pop it like a pistol
That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel
I feel freer than the slaves on the railroad
You think I'm lying
I feel like I'm flying
I feel like I'm finally free
I'm free
Chorus
I feel free
I'm rollin' with my niggas and we just bought the bar

Shorty lookin' at me 'cause she know I'm a star

I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it
This is for the little girls that say ,Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act all sadiddy
You be all on the block or posted up in the drop
And everybody get a band whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up and don't come to the hood
And how they raise their nose up like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight till it's time for picture
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bus , I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can't do no more
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine

I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time

I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it
This is for my lil homies that be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes they be passing their digits
Carry up on the block getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school getting off whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough might break your jaw
They'll bring back a lot if you bring them an o
But what you really ain't know they airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter they can't turn no dodge
No matter the scauldron lieutenant or sergent
Aitforce the army airforce in army
For tits is on em no heat is on em
'Cause grand mama prayed that he'd leave the corner
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next
And it don't matter what they say
We gon' make it
I remember when I was everything in the fire
I know I got fire 23's on my tire
Shout out to my brothers Jelani and Micaiah
Thanks to the Messiah my money getting higher
One time for my niggas that be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas that be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls that pushing their own ride
Still she ain't no ride 'cause bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad when I blaze the gun
I see you without a man might erased your sun
But look when you blow up everybody gon' shut up
This goes out to everybody on the coma
I got next, it's my time
I got next, to get mine
I got next, I'm on my grind
I got next, I'm gonna shine
I got next, it's my time

Straight out the driveway head to the highway
Red light , green light , got the best moves
Headlights beam bright got the best boobs
I call her double R my rough rider
We hit a couple malls then I remind her
Cuz on the road of life she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter than a coke bottle
She super charge cars anything for Minaj
And she could only park in the superstar garage
'Cause she-she-she-she bad if anybody ask
Her bags is boss cuz her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer tell 'em raise the offer
Used to fuck with a yellow bitch named Porsche
N-n-now it's me and her she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe , that's Louie Vuitton

We dive the piece she got more horses than a western
You know she beat weight so she don't eat late

""I know I'm cute, I know I'm fly.
You ask me why? Cause I'm the sh*t!""

Treat 'em like they stole somethin'
Beat 'em like they stole somethin'
All this booty here got 'em dreamin'
Lemme hold some
Let me, let me
Hear that boy
Let me, let me
Wear that boy
Let me get the most expensive car, and let me steer that boy
Real big pretty-titty, shut down every city
If you want the kid kitty, gotta get the key from me
All new everything, plus pay the rent for me
If we in the wilderness, n*ggas pitch the tent for me
Tent for me, tent for me
Get me bodied, long hair no make-up doing Pilates
Most n*ggas don't step on my damn Zanottis
All them b*tches my sons but who's the Daddy?
I graduate with honors
I ball, 'Nead O'Connor
I did a Freestyle, then I got a shoutout from Obam'er
Yes, yes, I am ill
I go in for the kill
Hoes is my sons
Birth control, I am on the pill
What I gotta do? What I gotta do to 'em?
Step up in the club, everybody like who them?
Girls, girls, me and my girls
What you done did?
I need some referrals
Motherf*ckers know I'm the sh*t, legit

If this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, There's some things
I should have said to you
First of all
Every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man I really am proud of you
Second of all I gotta say thanks
You really did alot
For my out of state banks
With that being said
Lets get down to the real
I still don't understand
What went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you
Just to give me the word
You know, A couple nouns
And a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls
That be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood
And get into the 'burbs
But everything you said
Was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don't really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings
Just to wait on you
But what I don't understand is
Why you told them you signed me
If you wasn't ready
To get totally behind me
I mean honestly, How could you deny me?
You know you're Harry
And I'll always be Hermione
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
Dear Wayne
I'm writing another letter cause
You never did respond
It's been a couple months
See when I speak
I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing
That they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit
That I ever wrote
You see me falling
Why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up
But now my times up
I swear to God man
I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord
Had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad
With some metaphors
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heavens doors
Let's play a game, Just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Lets act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes
Started running to me
And you was running out of breath
But you kept going
'Cause you finally realized what you slept on
You could take your own life
And you're a sinner, I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter
I pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
If you're reading this letter
I pulled the trigger
I've been lonely
I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart

Petty king, petty king
I mean really with that fun and rich petty bee
Anyway I just heard tip say
That black people turning lemons into lemonade
Tell them to demonstrate
I guess he did already
Guess I'm a little bitter
Cause I show b!tches how to do it
Like they baby sitter
So where my cash at?
Where my stash at?
I me, hooded  Jones wouldn't ask that
I do it for the little macs with their caps back
I let them niggas put the crack on the 
Know what I mean hit the sticky cream, pass that
Smoke b!tches, can't nicotine patch that
Don't need your spite to get ahead
came too much
shot is a shot if you've got a good aim
[Chorus]
I spent a long time coming but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when you faint
Our ways should change, our way should change
I spent a long time coming but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when you faint
Our ways should change, our way should change
[Ransom]
We on the road to riches
I'm f-cking loads of b!tches
I'm playing with you mama
Nicki she's so suspicious
My little golden mistress
For her I loath them biscuits
Cause yeah I roll with Nicholas
We so explicit, you won't resist it
He's been a long time coming,
But you don't know specifics
No more phony wishes
We ready, cause now we know their business
Come haller at your god
I always make it poor
Invite me to the wedding
I throw dollars at the bride
It's dirty money, dirty jeans
And dirty scuddies
You heard me funny, but chill
I'm still absurdly gully
Most of these rappers lost
There's no cash at all
If I knew this back then
I would've just played basketball
Or maybe not, they said that I never pass the ball
If there's no cash involved
Baby I'mma laugh at all
[Chorus]
I spent a long time coming but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when you faint
Our ways should change, our way should change
I spent a long time coming but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name
But honey ain't a damn thing funny when you faint
Our ways should change, our way should change
I spent a long time coming but I came
Now everybody in the rap game know my name

See you told me I would lose but I one
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
Caus' bitches couldn't take what was in me Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney out in LA with' Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em they gon' see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money yeah I'm Universal

Now the whole album crack you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door all the girl will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
Caus' before they could begin, you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick I'm a only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'till I muthafuckin say so
To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo

I am no longer trying to survive,
I believe that life is a prize,
But to live doesn't mean you're alive,
Don't worry bout me and who I fire
I get what I desire it's my empire
And yes I call the shots I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon a vampire, vampire
And this very moment I'm king
This very moment I slay Goliath with a sling,
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything that I will retire with the ring,
And I will retire with the crown, Yes!
No I'm not lucky I'm blessed, Yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ, Me!
But I couldn't do it all alone, We!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Paisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky we just vindicated, best believe that when were done
This moment will be syndicated, I don't know this night just reminds me
Of everything that they deprived me of, kuhh!
Ppppp put ya drinks up, it's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we wanna brink up.
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
Yeahh
Yeaahh
Yeahh, ugh
What I tell 'em hoes bow bow bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the Mafia that's word to Lil Cease
I'm in The Dominican Big Papi Ortiz
Doin talkin, practice all these bitches just aiming to please
Shoutout to the CEO 500 degrees
Shoutout to the OVO where we set for T's, oooow
Niggas wanna be friends how coincidental
This supposed to be our year we ain't get the memo
Young King, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet!
Yeaah, be very afraid these other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin can catch a bouquet, oww
Yeah, you a star in my eyes, you and all them white girls party of five
Are we drinking a lil more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it I'm partly surprised, I swear
Daaam, this one for the books, man!
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man!
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is, cause everybody dies but not everybody lives!
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
Cause in this moment I just feel so alive, alive, alive
This is my moment, I waited all my life I can tell it's time
Drifting away I'm one with the sunsets, I have become alive.
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life

Worried 'bout if my butt's fake,worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
These girls are my sons, John & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of an update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fuck with them real niggas, who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is, ring finger where the rock is
These hoes couldn't test me, even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with, mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasonin'
And tell 'em bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki, cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought god damn, this is the perfect time
We had just come from that video
You know LA traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt
But I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, lowkey it may be high key
I been peeped that you like me, you know
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn’t take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I’m obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that’s right, I like my girls BBW, yeah
Type to wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh, yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you,the bad-ass bitches
Doing makeup and hair fuck with you
Oh, that’s cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck, just give me the heads-up
So I can plan for it......(Pinkprint, AYE!)
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only
I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story teller
I piss greatness, like gold is yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy,treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is krazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the B out behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean pop-pop-pop, then I take off
Nigga now you see me, nigga now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx, acting like Ray Charles
16 in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bullywith 17 bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I still love, I still love

Hey yo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin’ wasn’t tasteful
Even though you out here lookin’ so ungrateful
I’mma keep it moving, be classy and graceful
I told 'em it’s no friends in the game
You ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain’t earned that yet
Self-righteous and entitled
but they swearin' on the Bible that they love you
when really they're no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on them, I just reflect on them
Pills and potions

Yo, people will love you and support when it’s beneficial
I’mma forgive, I won’t forgive but I’mma dead the issue
Soon as you out the nigga's lifes is when they start to miss you
They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Benzy, I see the envy when I’m causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for them, cop cribs in the Hills for them
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
And your time will be fine
And you time...

Defend my honor, protect my pride

But lookin back, it made me greater
You always told me, forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it, down to a science
Why am I tryin'? No you ain't buyin
I tried to fight it, back with defiance

From yellin' at you, and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' them at you

tired of letting passive aggression, control my mind,
capture my soul, OK, you're right just let it go,
OK you got it, it's in the can, before I played it,

Life's hard, I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealin' my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treatin' you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God

You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's goin' on?
They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell!
I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman
Pleaaaaaaase
Back to bed! Run along!
Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys
(Boys, boys, boys, boys, boys, boys)

It's not your fault
I'm a bitch I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast and I feast when I conquer

She tryna be like Little Kim, her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens right?
And what's her nationality, she chinese right?
I mean she OK, but she ain't ALL DAT
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch FALL BACK!
See I'm a hater, I go hard... listen let's begin
You know her last name Minaj, she a lesbian
And she ain't never comin out, look at currency
But every time she do a interview you know I run and see
She get me so sick it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me

Ask Craig Common, you can ask chris

Only underground bitch around that's duckin the paparatzi
In and outta town, be swirvin the mazeratzi
Stay around the white like a nazi
Pussy pppoppin on my poppers so the cops see... BITCHES!

Cassie : 
You get high love a bunch a girl
And then cry on top of the world
I hope you ... have tell me a lie
I hope I .... don't lose it tonight

Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, caught cagin' doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs
Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
Welcome to the crying game where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no easy cash, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not cause I hate ya
Not cause I wanna, guess I wanna imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it?
All this love you speak of
All I want is to love and to be loved
(To love and to be loved)
I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone
Cause the tears don't end
Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think I know
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play here
We're 'bout to play here
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o
We're 'bout to play
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're 'bout to play here
The crying game
Who-o-o-o-o-o, who-o-o-o-o-o

Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we about to get lifted
Lift and the President gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride
What is the hurry? It's pretty early
It's ok, we'll take our time

The night is still young
And so are we
The night is still young
The night is still young

And so are we
Ayo, drinks on you or the drinks is on me
We ain't going nowhere like tanks on E
We still getting money, which bank is it gonna be?
If he sexy, he planking on me
So when them big boys want all of that
Tell the bartender, say my order back
It's bottle service, he ordered that
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leaving 'till we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
Or we can drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is don't lose
I never worry, life is a journey
I just wanna enjoy the ride

I remember standing in the mirror
Searching for a winner but I didn't see it in her
Now I've gone from a zero to a super-hero-oh-oh
Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the World
Now I'm sitting on top of the World
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the World
[Verse 1:]
This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high for Diddy?
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don't come to the hood
How they turn they nose up like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight til it's time to pitch
That's when everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kids that can't do no more
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]

We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the World
[Verse 2:]
This is for my little homies that be asking for kisses
When I'm granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block, getting screwed by the cops
Cuttin' school gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They'll break in your door, might break in your jaw
They'll bring back a lye if you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know they airborne for stardom
With the ball in the gardens, stand tall, no dodgin'
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sargeant
Air Force, the army, air force and army fatigues is on em
No heats is on 'em
Cause grandmamma prayed that he'd leave the corner.
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
[Verse 3:]
I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire, 23′s almost higher
Shout outs to my brothers Jelani and Makiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas that be huggin' the block
2 Times for my niggas that be ducking the cops
3 Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stooshing they own rides from bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
I see you without a man, might erase ya son
Well look, when you blow up, everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause we sitting on top of the world
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause we sitting on top of the world
We winning, winning
Narcotics on the track.

I must have a quarter million on me right now
Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm 'bout is talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and their mood change
Like a motherfucker
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you are undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other
Talkin' filets with the truffle butter
Fresh sheets and towels, man she gotta love it
Yeah, they all get what they desire from it
What, tell them niggas we ain't hidin' from it
Yo, thinkin' out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
And I ain't talkin' about that Lil Wayne record
I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair, right now?
Uhh, do you hear me?
I can't let a wet nigga, get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch, if you dare me
I ain't never need a man, to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it
Uh, thinkin' out loud
I could be broke and keep a million dollar smile
LOL to the bank checkin' my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low
You ain't gotta tell your friend that I eat it in the morning
Cause she gonna say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put my leg on the tub
Girl, this my new dance move, I just don't know what to call it
But bitch you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude, what's his name? Not important
I bought some cocaine, you can snort it
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off like chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless and flawless
Smallest regardless, largest in charge and born in New Orleans
Get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly; Drake, Tunech and Barbie
You know

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
[Verse 1]
Anyway, lil' n*gga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you b*tches never land in
They be like what you doing Nicki?
Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landin'
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Presley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these b*tches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'ma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm the Sandro, paid on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my d*ck out case you b*tches get a slick throat

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
[Verse 2]
Won another round, Willin', get the ref
Got the clothing line poppin' and the wigs is next
When I fly you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherf*ckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the f*ck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you b*tches deaf as sh*t
B-b*tches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is the Re-Up better cop it while the cost low
F-flow's sick, I-I'll slap a patient
I'm checkin' these b*tches like an application
Cause these b*tches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-s-send 'em up in flames like a firemen
I do the hirin' and I do the firin'
That boss sh*t that you talk, I live it
And I'm callin' a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
B*tches
[Hook]
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Ain't got nothing for me, these dudes is funny
That's why I'm throwing shade like it's sunny
Who had Eminem on the first album?
Who had Kanye saying ""She a problem""?
Who the fuck came in the game made her own cologne?
Who made Lil Wayne give 'em five million?
Why the fuck I gotta say it, though?
You niggas don't know it yet?
Football touchdown on the Boeing jet
You my son, but I'm just not showing yet
Miss Icy, but it ain't snowing yet
You can tell I'm the illest cause my dividend is the biggest
Bitches ain't sitting with us, all my niggas in Margielas (Oh!)
Is pigs flying? Is these bitches trying me?
They think it's sweet? Oh, these bitches got diabetes!
You seen that list? It was me, Baby, Jay Z and Diddy
Want some more
Want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want some more
(Still want some more)
Want some more
Want some more
Every time I end up getting to it
Want some more
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they
(Want some more)
I know that I'm getting it, but fuck it cause I
(Want some more)
When they start talking crazy that's when I know that they
(Want some more)
Every time I end up getting it
(Want some more)
(Yo, Yo)
I'm in this bitch I'm house(?) to Diddy
I popped a Perc and I said ""thank you""
I'm popping tags everyday, it look like my B-Day
These bitches suck so I Nick Ninety(?) bitches BJ
They want that union, they want that D. Wade
I tell a ho ""just be happy they getting leeway""
My name Barbie, bitch (My name Barbie, bitch)
Alexander made me Queen
I'm pulling up with the King, I'm late to my own party, bitch
Want it, I get it, I don't be wanting for nothing
I mean, I do what I do and it must be counting for something
I don't be jumping from topic to topic, stay in my pocket
I got your rent in my pocket, so can I pay you to pop it?
Cash money, getting six albums
No bitch niggas want to bitch out
You niggas apologize and a nigga diss you?
That's a big problem
Want some more
Want some more
Even though a nigga been getting to it
Want some more
(Still want some more)
Want some more
Want some more
Every time I end up getting to it
Want some more

You can’t stop me, I’mma fulfill my prophecy
I do it, I did it, the proper way
Ah my property, now watch how we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
The VIP lights is hitting us just right
So if you getting money just throw it up in the air
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer
Cause I, I, I, I am Zolanski
Some call me Barbie, yes I’m life-size
Yes I am humble yes, but why lie?
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye!

Okay now, this right here can get me in trouble
Cause when I say I ball I don’t mean in a huddle
I’m always in the lime, never do nothing subtle
Cause it’s Pink Friday, ho! That's their rebuttal
My 2 guns up, let's blaze it, let's go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I’m at the game I’m in the best row
I am the baddest bitch in the pet store
Cause I, I, I am Onika
And these shoes here mean fashionista
‘cause these don’t come out til its Easter
I’m VIP bound with Leighton Meester
Wave ya hand if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave ya hand if you look good

Throw some shade if you look good

You bitches can't get my spot until I start raising some children
These bitches all in they feelings, can't fuck with Nicki they know it
They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moet
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I got that hour glass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me, you better just watch your nigga ho
I'm in that big boy, I am in beast mode
Beast make that G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches gone get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours I'm tipping, you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed
Cause I Win Again, Cause I Win Again,
and I Win Again, and I Win Again, and I Win Again, and I Win Again,
and I Win Again, Yeah I Win Again
Can't tell me nothing about it, your opinion isn't doubted
Go against me, then you made a mistake
Yo, yo, cause I came out, '09 when promoters brought Wayne out
Lewinsky, like I couldn't get the stain out
I been bad, like cutting school, and staying out
I been hotter then vacationing, and laying out
I sat back, and watched how it was playing out
They diss me, but running and took the same route
Uh, but no, they not Nicki, wrist on Ice and yes my wrist Bricky
If I leave, the game will miss Nicki, not a website booking, money, this is 50
Pop bottles with my bitches and get pissy
This shit ain't got no more integrity
Don't write they raps, and plus they flow shitty
Don't make me expose you bitch, I'm too busy
Hoped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki Still the queen, Niggas already
(Hoped on the Bridge-y, New York City
Nicki Still the queen, Niggas already)
Soon as I came in I told them that I would become the greatest
Muhammad Ali, these bitches, and that can't be debated
I never chicken'd, I skated, I know they mad that I made it
All this money I made, all my bitches is laced
Cause I Win Again, Cause I Win Again, and I Win Again, and I Win Again,
and I Win Again, and I Win Again, and I Win Again, Yeah I Win Again
Can't tell me nothing about it, your opinion isn't doubted
Go against me, then you made a mistake
So good, so real, so good, yeah
Imma win again, Imma win again
I'm Meryl Streep to all these bitches, they can't do what I do
Sometimes I just look in the mirror and I be like, ""Why you?""
Yeah, I know that they mad, but Imma shit on my critics some more
I am..

I am still gonna do, what he sent me to do
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way,
That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way, That's kill, kill, everything in, everything in my way
